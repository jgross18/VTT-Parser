1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.630
Capstone Coach 1: Good.

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.080
Capstone Coach 1: what's going on.

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.930
Jim Clark: he's capstone coach number one.

4
00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.349
Capstone Coach 1: Oh okay oh yeah well.

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.790
Capstone Coach 1: I mean in the hood it was in classroom was so heavy on.

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.270
MS Analytics Class 2021: The greatest.

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.850
Jim Clark: Oh that's cool, you can see, on the screen there Nice.

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.940
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, all right well.

9
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.270
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

10
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.200
Capstone Coach 1: Alright um this may deem is being recorded.

11
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.730
Capstone Coach 1: Like a chef to prove that.

12
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.460
Capstone Coach 1: Can everybody hear me all right.

13
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.480
Capstone Coach 1: You got this microphone so we're there.

14
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.950
Zuberi, Bilal: Yes, we can.

15
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:24.180
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, all right let's keep going then i'll bring up well i'm going to share i'm going to share my screen here, try to shoot much right.

16
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.770
Capstone Coach 1: So some more people finish their capstone this past week, and today.

17
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:51.750
Capstone Coach 1: So congratulations I think we're we're in the home run we're in the homestretch right now, they just have a few more to go, those of you that are waiting to present i'm sure you're anxious but you'll do you'll do fine i'm sure.

18
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.490
Capstone Coach 1: Now, if you go to the campus site which I can you see my screen all right right now.

19
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.450
Capstone Coach 1: Anybody got a verification okay good good.

20
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.120
Capstone Coach 1: I have a habit to start talking with.

21
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:21.360
Capstone Coach 1: Right, where is the there it is, I think yeah, this is it okay so we're going to go to Yankee campus and if you go in to week number 12 can you believe it we're in week 12.

22
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:33.810
Capstone Coach 1: Oh, my goodness April, the sixth we actually have about a month to go, so not much, but you'll see if you look in the week 12 folder you're going to see.

23
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:45.300
Capstone Coach 1: Several files i'm going to update this PowerPoint file because there's one thing I just added to the front of it so hang on just a second here i'm going to.

24
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.010
Capstone Coach 1: select a different file browse.

25
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.640
Capstone Coach 1: Let me make sure that I did save that off.

26
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.720
Capstone Coach 1: OK.

27
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.230
Capstone Coach 1: OK now let's save.

28
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.430
Capstone Coach 1: There we go alright.

29
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.980
Capstone Coach 1: So this will be titled week 12.

30
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.260
Capstone Coach 1: PowerPoint.

31
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.530
Capstone Coach 1: and

32
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:35.520
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, submit it's not a big file that's don't have a lot of slides but it's so i've kind of combined some things with slides and you'll what you'll want to download the the PowerPoint presentation.

33
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:48.360
Capstone Coach 1: or not it's up to you, of course, you'll also want to download these three files The first one is a data file the IBM weekly stock prices, since about 1989.

34
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:57.480
Capstone Coach 1: And we're going to be looking at several things tonight, one thing that we're going to spend some time on is the class project, and I know we've been.

35
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.810
Capstone Coach 1: sort of putting that off because of the capstones but it's time that we get serious about that.

36
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:12.510
Capstone Coach 1: Then we'll also be looking at the will start a lecture or two here on analysis of time series.

37
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:20.430
Capstone Coach 1: And how that can be done, and you have you've already had a course on time series analysis so some of this might be deja vu for you.

38
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:32.790
Capstone Coach 1: let's go to the let's go to the PowerPoint presentation first i'm going to open that up where is it there, it is okay So here we are on the slide number three.

39
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:59.100
Capstone Coach 1: and your assignment for week number 11 was to just experiment with the template that we had for fitting the analysis of images digital images using charisse and, in particular, you lose using the convolution features that are in kairos so, believe it or not, OK.

40
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.630
Capstone Coach 1: I will.

41
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.790
Capstone Coach 1: Let me show you what charisse will do to a professor, my goodness, look at all of these cases that I ran.

42
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:21.570
Capstone Coach 1: I was trying to see Okay, can I get this to zero, can I get this to zero misclassification there must be a way to get it to zero, I tried every combination.

43
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:29.400
Capstone Coach 1: I recorded the combinations and the number of miss classifications, and how long it took.

44
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:36.810
Capstone Coach 1: One of them here took like 37 minutes or 39 minutes, that was a coffee break or Bray breakfast i'm not sure why.

45
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:47.190
Capstone Coach 1: But you know I would get up and come in here and just say okay let's do this one let's do this one, and the best I could get it, the absolute best.

46
00:05:47.670 --> 00:06:06.390
Capstone Coach 1: Was zero misclassification is on the training data and only 55 and the validation data so that that gave you 100% accuracy for the training data and an accuracy of 99.5%.

47
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:18.960
Capstone Coach 1: For the validation data, but I couldn't get that last half a percent I tried, so let me ask a question did anybody get 00 am I, the only one.

48
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.460
I know.

49
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:22.830
Capstone Coach 1: So what do you got zero.

50
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.870
Swanson J, Charles: No.

51
00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.280
Monica A. Harwig: No, no.

52
00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.710
Capstone Coach 1: either no me no not in the.

53
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.440
Capstone Coach 1: Not in both the training and I didn't think so.

54
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.050
Capstone Coach 1: huh.

55
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.880
Capstone Coach 1: yeah.

56
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.020
Zuberi, Bilal: Only in training, but um it's a guess maybe there is some.

57
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.360
Zuberi, Bilal: Some population in the training data that is so.

58
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.530
Capstone Coach 1: so slow I.

59
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.690
Zuberi, Bilal: validation can be go.

60
00:06:49.680 --> 00:07:00.180
Capstone Coach 1: There is another approach and i'm going to give that a try once we talk about what that approaches, but it's using a different kind of neural network here we're using convolution.

61
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:09.210
Capstone Coach 1: The first part of it is convolution so my best scenario that the best scenario that I found was right here.

62
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:20.130
Capstone Coach 1: And what I did was I put 64 a size is a neural network of 64 with a three by three template.

63
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:36.420
Capstone Coach 1: Not template but it's called a filter three by three filter to shrink the images smoothie images convolution is basically a process for shrinking and smoothing smoothing the images, so that you get down to something smaller that the.

64
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:50.550
Capstone Coach 1: nlp network, the neural network can process, so the the best that I found was 64 on the first convolution followed by a pooling Max Max pooling of to.

65
00:07:51.060 --> 00:08:03.570
Capstone Coach 1: followed by another 64 with a three by three filter and then a Max pooling of two I believe I also used l one it's not shown here, but I believe.

66
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.820
Capstone Coach 1: I believe I might have used the one that is the regularization let me check.

67
00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.300
Capstone Coach 1: rinse so many of these cases all right all right, no I didn't use any regularization on that.

68
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:26.610
Capstone Coach 1: Although if you do some regularization it's, not that I use the the Alpha delta optimizer which seemed to work better for me.

69
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:37.170
Capstone Coach 1: And I used to set the random seed to 1234 or five, of course, and I did use regularization in the nlp part of the of the.

70
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:48.960
Capstone Coach 1: neural network, and so you know the way this is set up, and if you look at the here we go if you look at the description and the powerpoints is slide number three, I think that is.

71
00:08:49.590 --> 00:09:03.480
Capstone Coach 1: you'll see that it's can convolution pool convolution pool and what happens is during the convolution part basically what you're doing is you're smoothing the image, by using a three by three filter.

72
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:11.940
Capstone Coach 1: And you're getting rid of the edge so originally it was 28 by 28 after the first convolution it goes to 26.

73
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:22.020
Capstone Coach 1: And then, when you do the pooling operation using a two by two filter you you cut the the the width and the height and half so.

74
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:37.290
Capstone Coach 1: 26 divided by two and be 13 so i'm now the images is smaller it's down to 13 and then we smooth it once more getting rid of the little gravity edges and we get down to 11.

75
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:48.360
Capstone Coach 1: And then we pull it again, which means we take half of 11 would be five or six but they use fi and so that's the convolution part right there.

76
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:57.870
Capstone Coach 1: One convolution one pool one convolution one pool, and then you have to flatten it out, which means, instead of having a tensor which is.

77
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:12.630
Capstone Coach 1: A three dimensional object really three dimensional not be array is what it is, you can see here it's a five by five by 64 I said of passing that to the nlp neural network which is right down here.

78
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:23.970
Capstone Coach 1: You can't do that if you don't flatten you get in there and and the arrow says what are you doing to me i'm expecting a one dimensional object here tense or have one dimensions.

79
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:29.310
Capstone Coach 1: And you're giving me something with three divergence so it'll it'll complain and stop.

80
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:42.750
Capstone Coach 1: If you take five times five times 64 you get 1600 inputs, so when they do the flattening operation what they're doing is taking the image and stringing all of the pixels that are remaining.

81
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:54.390
Capstone Coach 1: All the modification modified pixels really that are remaining and there are 1600 of them and then putting that into a neural network with 300% stronger than the first layer

82
00:10:55.590 --> 00:11:05.580
Capstone Coach 1: And since it's dense they're connected all 1600 inputs, which means you got a bunch of weights look at that 480,000 300 weights.

83
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:11.820
Capstone Coach 1: In that first hidden layer This is where all of the gymnastics or the heavy lifting is coming right in there.

84
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:22.590
Capstone Coach 1: And then I put in a second hand that hidden layer with the only with a fewer number of precept ron's So there you have 300 times 100 which is 30,000.

85
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:34.500
Capstone Coach 1: Plus 100 bias terms for each of the weights in this hidden layer and, finally, you get down to the categorical output there 10 different digits and.

86
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:49.470
Capstone Coach 1: right here you're putting that together, using the socks soft Max activation in this last case, and so the total number of parameters there's over half a million, but.

87
00:11:50.220 --> 00:12:00.240
Capstone Coach 1: It took about 11 minutes to run this and, at the end of 11 minutes I got zero misclassification on the training and like I said 55.

88
00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:13.980
Capstone Coach 1: On the other, I am going to be very curious if somebody can get the same thing on windows, or whatever you're using if anybody runs is if anybody is able to get the same scenario.

89
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:19.080
Capstone Coach 1: Quality output zero and 55 send me an email.

90
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:27.870
Capstone Coach 1: i'd like to know what you did like I said I was getting really frustrated because i've done these sorts of things often and.

91
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:34.020
Capstone Coach 1: I usually can get down to zero by some trickery or something like that, but not this time.

92
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:53.160
Capstone Coach 1: So I, there is another solution and we're going to be talking about recurrent neural networks starting this week, mostly that starting next week and that might actually do the trick we'll see I don't know, but this is about as good as I can get it.

93
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.680
Capstone Coach 1: In any questions or comments.

94
00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:04.680
Swanson J, Charles: Dr Jones this is Charles was able to get it to five a miss classifications on training and.

95
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.610
Swanson J, Charles: Miss classifications on validation.

96
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:09.180
Capstone Coach 1: mm hmm.

97
00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:15.990
Swanson J, Charles: So I did better on the validation and it took 10 minutes.

98
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:26.520
Capstone Coach 1: Well that's that's that's interesting because I didn't get anything below 55 for the validation data and you got you got 54 you say.

99
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:31.500
Capstone Coach 1: Correct that's interesting well send me the send me those conditions, I like to see that.

100
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.710
Capstone Coach 1: yeah appreciate it.

101
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:52.290
Capstone Coach 1: Of course there are anomalies there you know there's there's some magic and weird things that happen when you go between Max and windows, we all know that so though I wouldn't expect that somebody actually did much better than this, I wouldn't be surprised.

102
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:54.390
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

103
00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:02.910
Capstone Coach 1: Well, that was her That was my That was my fun thing you know i've been good getting kind of goofy around here with my wife.

104
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:10.380
Capstone Coach 1: Well, not with my wife, but I mean she's the goofy one because she's working here at home also and.

105
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:23.550
Capstone Coach 1: She really needs to get out, you know she really needs to take a walk outside or less she actually does that she goes to the gym two or three times a day but it doesn't seem to be enough she's.

106
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:39.600
Capstone Coach 1: she's having some stresses us, I think, with work and and just it's just being cooked up right not being able to just have coffee with your friends and things like that, at work and things like that so anyway well let's go on tonight.

107
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.020
Capstone Coach 1: If you have some questions, please let me know.

108
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:51.840
Capstone Coach 1: Wait a minute I spelled convolution wrong i'm a bad guy seal and the.

109
00:14:52.860 --> 00:15:05.070
Capstone Coach 1: O l you a convolution right Thank you um let's go on to slide number four and the first thing we're going to do tonight is talk about.

110
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:19.440
Capstone Coach 1: That a the class projects, so I in the next in these three slides four or five and six, I put your name in here somewhere now if you don't find your name in here, let me know.

111
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:30.720
Capstone Coach 1: Because this is what I have on my records is that I have your name, so I have you assigned to you know you volunteered created your own group, so to speak.

112
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:40.050
Capstone Coach 1: And so what we're going to do, then, is we're going to go over this and then i'm going to give you guys time to get together.

113
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:48.960
Capstone Coach 1: your team get together and and take this information that I have to the next level man you're going to see that in some cases.

114
00:15:49.560 --> 00:16:00.300
Capstone Coach 1: The information was provided was really very good very professional but in many cases, I think the thought was let's let's just put some good idea down.

115
00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:12.360
Capstone Coach 1: And let's see the good ideas good enough and then for the most part, I would say this, all of the ideas were great the only concern I have is scope.

116
00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:28.320
Capstone Coach 1: Some of the ideas looked sounded like they might take more time than we have in this class and they certainly in my opinion, go beyond what I would have expected you to do now, if you want to do that hey i'm all for it.

117
00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:32.730
Capstone Coach 1: But we do have a month ago, one of the first.

118
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:44.970
Capstone Coach 1: Project presentations will be on Thursday Tuesday April 27 I believe that's let me double check make sure i've got that date right, yes, that would be.

119
00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:53.790
Capstone Coach 1: April, the 27th so approximately half of a you're going to be doing your class presentations on April 27.

120
00:16:54.420 --> 00:17:05.100
Capstone Coach 1: And then the other half will be doing them on May, the fourth approximately half i'm not i'm not sure whether it's going to be 5050 or 3070 or what have you.

121
00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:17.160
Capstone Coach 1: we're going to play this year but that's The idea is that the there was no, there is no final exam and so may the fourth, I think, is the day that we had scheduled for our final exam.

122
00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:21.900
Capstone Coach 1: So i'm going to use that for part of our presentations at least.

123
00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:33.660

127
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:16.110
Capstone Coach 1: Now I wouldn't be too afraid about this because, maybe my expectations in terms of your effort here is that this is going to be the equivalent of maybe one to two homework projects right so let's talk about this okay amanda are you here.

137
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:03.780
Travis Smith: Sir.

138
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.180
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, good and travis torque.

139
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:11.730
Capstone Coach 1: I believe, is how you smell that smell, I say that I don't know.

140
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:24.060
Capstone Coach 1: Okay okay thanks travis alright, so what you wrote down was you'd like to do a sentiment analysis on recent news stories for selected corporations and news agencies and.

141
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:45.510
Capstone Coach 1: yeah what I think we need to do here is to flush this out a little bit is I wrote down on the right more details are required some clear where the articles will be coming from and what i'm recommending is that you target specific news agencies and probably only a few of those now.

142
00:19:46.830 --> 00:20:05.610
Capstone Coach 1: i'm not sure what your intention here is, I think it might be to compare the sentiment of different you know very different agencies for, for example, maybe msnbc maybe CNN on one end and then Fox, on the other, hands, and there are a few others on that other end.

143
00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:13.950
Capstone Coach 1: So I would take one agency from each end of the political spectrum, so to speak, and and.

144
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:22.320
Capstone Coach 1: and focus on that agency, maybe just two agencies now which 1am I going to choose i'm going to choose the one that I can get the articles from.

145
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:40.410
Capstone Coach 1: Because you forgot to get the text from you've got to get the article access to the articles and you've got to get the text on that now, some of them if they don't make it free right, so you said you so take a look at that I would choose to agencies that have.

146
00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:49.080
Capstone Coach 1: Easy access to a lot of different articles right now I don't watch I try not to watch the news.

147
00:20:49.470 --> 00:21:01.500
Capstone Coach 1: But when I do, I hear some you know the same old stuff we're not going through the election anymore, but there's certainly a lot of stuff going on the news ways that this air news, whatever that.

148
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:13.230
Capstone Coach 1: You know these guys these in reporters are churning the mill trying to get people to watch their their podcasts and you know saying a lot of things to get people excited.

149
00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:24.270
Capstone Coach 1: So there's certainly a lot of other words there's plenty out there for you to work with so we're going to we're going to take a break here just a second and what i'd like the three of you to do is to get together.

150
00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:34.800
Capstone Coach 1: Now you can get together on zoom you can get together on go I don't care how you get together it's up to you three you could have a conference call on your cell phone So if you want to check.

Christian Gover: yeah yeah the zillow website still there it's just the API they took it.

268
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:16.140
Capstone Coach 1: All because i'd heard on the news that they were going out of business or.

Okay.

288
00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:05.580
Kilani, Shadi: To, just to clarify, we should break out into smaller groups and discuss this.

289
00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:06.480
Capstone Coach 1: Yes, Sir yeah.

290
00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:08.700

293
00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:22.200
Capstone Coach 1: appreciate it yeah no second we have charisse and I know she's what she's working on constructing a ui with Radio buttons and it's a great idea.

294
00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.580
Capstone Coach 1: But i'm a little bit again i'm a little bit worried about scope.

295
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:41.910
Capstone Coach 1: Why don't you guys power, a little bit talk about who's going to do what, and in particular what the scope of your projects going to be Maybe you can think about how to limit it to one or two topics and for this project right.

296
00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.070
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, Monica and one and kieran freeman.

297
00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:54.000
Capstone Coach 1: You want to extend the two friend gui that we had in Class two three frames great idea.

298
00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:06.780
Capstone Coach 1: You know you're gonna have to use the fall whole screen, you might have to change the resolution and get down to where you can get three of them and that sounds like a fantastic idea of the scope would be.

299
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:20.370
Capstone Coach 1: Reasonable very reasonable, so instead of just having two graphs which be like volume and price, you might have volume price and what was I forget the other thing that we had the data that we had there.

300
00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:34.410
Capstone Coach 1: Well, anyway, I like your ideas and so, if you could talk a little bit about your scope and how you're going to do this tonight and get back to me appreciate it oh kindle on.

301
00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.510
Capstone Coach 1: Yes, around at question.

302
00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:38.970
Monica Harwig: Oh no I just said we'll do that this is Monica.

303
00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:51.150
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, all right good hey and then we have kindle and Keith create a good way to detect famous landmarks and Oh, I like this one, but i'm really concerned about scope.

304
00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:53.730
Karen Fireman: here just miss this what.

305
00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:54.150
What.

306
00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:57.840
Karen Fireman: i'm sorry I didn't even hear you call me and do our stuff i'm so sorry.

307
00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:01.440
Capstone Coach 1: yeah so kindle are you here and Keith.

308
00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.120
Capstone Coach 1: Yes, okay.

309
00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.970
Capstone Coach 1: So, are you guys worried about the scope on this.

310
00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:13.860
Kendall Sizemore: i'm not too worried Google cloud has a cloud vision API that we can leverage to detect landmarks.

311
00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:15.600
Kendall Sizemore: Okay well documented.

312
00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.310
Kendall Sizemore: So.

313
00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:20.160
Capstone Coach 1: So you're already familiar with that API.

314
00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.400
Kendall Sizemore: Know it's something that we just research and had an idea.

315
00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:33.540
Capstone Coach 1: So you're good with it, I mean this is a fantastic thing i'd love to see you do this it's, but it is outside a bit outside of where we will we did in class.

316
00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:41.370
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, but it's good so if y'all could bow a little bit, and since make sure this is really what you're going to go after be fine.

317
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:49.500
Capstone Coach 1: And then we have Natasha Joanna and and so yesterday I don't know faster here Natasha Joanna you hear.

318
00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:50.370
Capstone Coach 1: us.

319
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:51.930
Capstone Coach 1: Okay unnecessary you here.

320
00:35:54.750 --> 00:36:03.030
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so this is an excellent project very high marks very I saw the right up there, right up and Oh, my goodness.

321
00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:08.880
Capstone Coach 1: You i'm on I will show everybody this right up, it is fantastic.

322
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:19.410
Capstone Coach 1: I don't know who did it of the group here, but you guys did a great job on that right up high marks the only thing i'm concerned about a scope right.

323
00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:33.000
Capstone Coach 1: So you're thinking two weeks a little over two weeks left or can how much of this can you really do at this time, so let's get the i'd like you guys to get together and see what you think about the scope rp.

324
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:40.170
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, Brian Nicholas and Charles and Charles is here, Brian are you here.

325
00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:41.310
Brian Frankel: And here.

326
00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:42.120
Okay.

327
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:50.940
Capstone Coach 1: All right, so you're going to again we're going to extend the stock analysis gooey to provide by cell hold based upon Oh, I like this one.

328
00:36:52.290 --> 00:37:10.140
Capstone Coach 1: This is really good the problem here, though, is those technical indicators, a lot of them are like moving moving air, you know I felt at the moving average for the last six weeks exceeds a certain number, then you sell or you buy you know so.

329
00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:19.230
Capstone Coach 1: Putting those together is is technically a little involved you're going to have to identify the the indicators.

330
00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:36.240
Capstone Coach 1: And i'm suggesting here that maybe limit the scope to just two or three indicators, or just find maybe the best buy indicator and the best side sell indicator which are usually things based on moving averages, and then you and implement that that would be fantastic.

331
00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:48.000
Capstone Coach 1: You know I wrote a program some years ago on a buy sell indicators using genetic algorithms and I came up and compiled something like over 25 different indicators.

332
00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:58.380
Capstone Coach 1: And then, for each one of those indicators, there is an issue about how long or how high, you have to have, be it to the issue of sell or buy so it's.

333
00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:13.890
Capstone Coach 1: A it's can be a little tricky so i'm just saying, maybe just pick to do that, one by one, for cell and then anything else, of course, this whole so well y'all could get together and talk about that see what see what you like to do.

334
00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:19.230
Capstone Coach 1: OK, we have Jordan Craig and Charlie Ellis.

335
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.060
Capstone Coach 1: y'all hear.

336
00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:26.160
Jordan Gross: me one of those people as me and i'm here so hopefully I get.

337
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:26.970
Charlie Ellis: here to.

338
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:28.470
Craig: Okay, great.

339
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.010
Okay.

340
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:44.610
Capstone Coach 1: This is way cool I did not know that's you're kidding I mean zoom not only records the conference, but also produces a text of the conference Is that correct.

341
00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:55.260
Jordan Gross: Yes, Professor so whenever we go into campus and we go to the recordings folder each one of the recordings actually includes a dot vtt file and transcription file.

342
00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:03.690
Jordan Gross: That when i've opened it in the past i've just opened it up in word and line by line it looks quite easy to create a purse or four It just shows the name.

343
00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:13.020
Jordan Gross: yeah time they started talking time they stopped talking and the words so if we wanted to contain the scope we could create a posture That just goes.

344
00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:21.870
Jordan Gross: By the names and gets a standard deviation of how much time each person spent talking the average amount of talkers through individual session or.

345
00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:31.650
Jordan Gross: Anything average word counts of those people scope could really be increased or limited based on how much we struggled to get the initial parsing going.

346
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:48.210
Jordan Gross: But I think, even if we just got to a point where, in the terminal you could point it to a dot vtt file and have it get you a list of the participants and the amount of time, each of them spent talking and build out from there, I think we'd be on a good path or having a lot of fun.

347
00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:49.410
Capstone Coach 1: So you Jordan.

348
00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:50.160
Jordan Gross: Yes, sir.

349
00:39:50.460 --> 00:40:00.750
Capstone Coach 1: Okay fantastic fantastic I like what you're saying I will do start small and if you hack that off and then, if you have time to branch out from there, I like that.

350
00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:02.370
Jordan Gross: Thank you.

351
00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:10.560
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so if you could power with your your other folks there and and get back with me in about an hour OK.

352
00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:28.410
Capstone Coach 1: And now we get to slide number six and, as you see it's I got names, but no nothing there now Ryan Decker and know Brian brandon and Leah I believe you guys, have you sent me something, but I haven't seen it I don't know word is.

353
00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.420
Ryan David: Yes, here i'm here it's Friday this.

354
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:44.160
Ryan David: week we our plan is to extend homework six and add translation into a selected language of the company description and the keywords.

355
00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.810
Ryan David: and also to offer a.

356
00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:52.800
Ryan David: A reading of the translated text.

357
00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:54.450
Capstone Coach 1: Good.

358
00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:11.310
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so again, once again, if you could borrow a little bit here and talk about I think that's a reasonable scope.

359
00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:13.590
Capstone Coach 1: Because we talked about those.

360
00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:25.950
Capstone Coach 1: Things in class so just better putting it all together, but still, you know just you do have a limited amount of time, so if y'all could Pal all together and figure out who's going to do what, when and some make this all come together appreciate it.

361
00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:27.180
Ryan David: Yes or no.

362
00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:36.660

Capstone Coach 1: Ah, there he goes.

470
00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:27.330

00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:28.290
Capstone Coach 1: I sure do.

472
00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:30.780

Fritz, Joanna: Yes.

474
00:59:33.630 --> 00:59:36.150
Natasha Chevarunotai: Okay, this is what we have so far, Dr Jones.

475
00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:51.810
Natasha Chevarunotai: as described in the description we kind of extended the translation Apps that we worked on just the key one we added in is the image like try to recognize a text from the image right.

476
00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:58.560
Natasha Chevarunotai: So this is got what we've got it to work so far think.

477
01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:08.640
Natasha Chevarunotai: Right and then i'm just gonna test the text text recognition model so.

478
01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:10.290
Natasha Chevarunotai: This is the English way.

479
01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.190
Capstone Coach 1: they're supposed to.

480
01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:18.660
Natasha Chevarunotai: yeah that's the original folder on your left as an input.

481
01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:36.180
Natasha Chevarunotai: And arrived and we're trying to like kind of play with it, so that when we translate we've kind of tried to pass it back on the original picture of this for this fine idea for the new survey so that's kind of our our progress off on that, and if you translated to Spanish.

482
01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.620
Capstone Coach 1: I could see that yeah.

483
01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:40.770
Capstone Coach 1: This is amazing.

484
01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:52.380
Natasha Chevarunotai: yeah that's Spanish there and they do the oil a day the problem or whatever we didn't really figure it out, is when we do Chinese we can translate it.

485
01:00:54.870 --> 01:01:01.740
Natasha Chevarunotai: When we passed it back on the picture we have just have to find a find staff support languish Rachel.

486
01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:19.710
Natasha Chevarunotai: That we're not quite there yet for like the the picture languages like Chinese and Japanese translation works well, but putting it back on image is not it's not quite not quite there yet that's a poor man, I mean I don't know if it's a requirement to improve it right, as the second.

487
01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:21.090
Natasha Chevarunotai: But.

488
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:29.790
Capstone Coach 1: What you guys are doing this far beyond what are my expectations, this is this is amazing, this is really good.

489
01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:32.520
Natasha Chevarunotai: yeah and just to.

490
01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:35.820
Capstone Coach 1: Show you a little we've already done it and we already finished it right.

491
01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:36.210
Yes.

492
01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:41.040
Natasha Chevarunotai: Okay, this is like the image in different language.

493
01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:43.800
Natasha Chevarunotai: mm hmm image is actually in Thai.

494
01:01:45.090 --> 01:01:47.730
Natasha Chevarunotai: And then we translated to English pretty good.

495
01:01:50.910 --> 01:02:00.120
Capstone Coach 1: Fantastic now does this work for any any picture, or just for the pictures that she had loaded up here on your computer.

496
01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:10.890
Natasha Chevarunotai: What do you mean I mean we haven't really tested it with many pictures yet well far so far that you tested it work.

497
01:02:11.550 --> 01:02:12.060
Natasha Chevarunotai: yeah.

498
01:02:12.330 --> 01:02:16.410
Capstone Coach 1: yeah we yeah I guess the I guess i'm the only recommendation I have is.

499
01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:17.940
Capstone Coach 1: see if you can break it.

500
01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:21.510
Capstone Coach 1: You know what let me.

501
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:25.380
Capstone Coach 1: see if you can find a picture that he doesn't like.

502
01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:26.700
yeah.

503
01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:32.100
Capstone Coach 1: When you do your presentation it works really good except this.

504
01:02:32.130 --> 01:02:43.500
Natasha Chevarunotai: Yes, I hear you and watch watch watch one thing that's kind of a glitch here that we haven't really figured out right you see the output here, it says one thing.

505
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:47.040
Natasha Chevarunotai: And i'm, the picture is slightly different.

506
01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:55.380
Natasha Chevarunotai: Just because when it passed for the text from the picture it passed by word right.

507
01:02:55.530 --> 01:03:08.610
Natasha Chevarunotai: Whereas it's like even if you let it recognize it by sentences of this translation came out a little different yeah doing what was meant that's that's that's that's kind of.

508
01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:12.120
Capstone Coach 1: I, this is just amazing.

509
01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.150
Capstone Coach 1: This is just amazing I mean.

510
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:20.700
Capstone Coach 1: I would like I don't know if I should you guys should go first or last.

511
01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:41.130
Capstone Coach 1: Because I think, maybe we better have you go last because everybody else is gonna be like oh my God, we have to do all that you know you did great, and the only thing I would recommend here is like i'm saying is maybe maybe find that in America, you want to make your presentation interesting.

512
01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:41.790
Natasha Chevarunotai: Yes.

513
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:49.890
Capstone Coach 1: So it's really easy to grasp exactly what you're doing based upon your going, you know just a few seconds oh yeah I understand.

514
01:03:51.540 --> 01:04:04.920
Capstone Coach 1: So you got to make your presentation interesting well, one of the things so to make it interesting is, if you had some novel photographs, maybe that broke the system some novel photographs where it works and novel photographs were doesn't work.

515
01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:09.600
Capstone Coach 1: I want curious about is if it's if the image is blurry.

516
01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:19.320
Capstone Coach 1: Know oftentimes or the letters are small human wouldn't be able to read that yes, My guess is the computer could read it.

517
01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.800
Capstone Coach 1: I guess because they could filter the.

518
01:04:23.010 --> 01:04:33.960
Capstone Coach 1: Computer does a higher better resolution than your than the eyes i'm guessing so have you found an image, where you can't really read it, but the computer can.

519
01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:39.870
Natasha Chevarunotai: have one Randy we haven't really looked at it, yet, but i'll try to find it I think that's a.

520
01:04:40.770 --> 01:04:42.360
Capstone Coach 1: testament Shell for you go.

521
01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:51.390
Capstone Coach 1: Because i'm thinking that that's probably what you'll find a case where the computer does a better job of reading the human would be.

522
01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.040
Natasha Chevarunotai: that's interesting okay.

523
01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:53.850
we'll see.

524
01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:57.840
Natasha Chevarunotai: Okay, and we actually I think we.

525
01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:06.180
Natasha Chevarunotai: actually have a question on the requirement for the presentation, or like the report out that you.

526
01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:09.150
Capstone Coach 1: know I had somebody else asked that as well.

527
01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:27.150
Capstone Coach 1: I don't have any high expectations, other than your you need to be comfortable with your presentation and so what i'm expecting to see is some people will only use powerpoints and some people might have powerpoints with notes.

528
01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:29.190
Capstone Coach 1: But.

529
01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:37.800
Capstone Coach 1: Some people may have a live DEMO where if it's a gui or something like like in your case you bring it up on the screen you run it.

530
01:05:38.550 --> 01:05:46.650
Capstone Coach 1: will make a video will make a video of your presentation everything, everything will be videotaped right, so you don't really need.

531
01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:58.500
Capstone Coach 1: Your your your report that you said is outstanding I mean maybe put it, maybe you take that to a new level so that you have something written I told a swanson and I said.

532
01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:07.080
Capstone Coach 1: One of the things you want to think about is I portfolio to go with your resume wave here I don't know if you're looking for a new job right.

533
01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:20.310
Capstone Coach 1: But at some point, if you want to find a new job you have a resume which talks about oh yeah you're an aggie you went to school and all that sort of thing, but then maybe a portfolio that shows some of the things that you've done.

534
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:23.850
Capstone Coach 1: And this would be beautiful on the portfolio.

535
01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:40.680
Capstone Coach 1: They have complexity is high it's easy to communicate and it's interesting right right, so I would quit this I would think about putting this up in format that you would could use us for a job interview.

583
01:32:20.310 --> 01:32:33.540
Travis Smith: Yes, Sir, and kind of what we were thinking is that um so the team is going to implement a sentiment analysis for recent news stories for selected stock tickers in a stock gooey so it's kind of an extension on what we had done.

584
01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:45.270
Travis Smith: But what we're going to do as a sentiment analysis, not for the news agency, but of the stock company like IBM so we'll pull articles from fox news CNN and associated press.

585
01:32:45.570 --> 01:32:59.430
Travis Smith: To get a wide sentiment view that way we can kind of touch on kind of the extremes and ap typically kind of being a little bit more in that middle and then how the new speaks of an organization can affect stock prices, so we felt that this would help investors.

586
01:33:00.930 --> 01:33:05.070
Capstone Coach 1: Do you have a good feeling about who you're going to pull these stories from.

678
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:33.060
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

679
01:40:34.110 --> 01:40:35.130
Capstone Coach 1: Any updates.

680
01:40:35.370 --> 01:40:37.650
Karis Jochen: hey Dr Jones this is charisse.

681
01:40:38.370 --> 01:41:00.060
Karis Jochen: mm hmm, and so our FDA is that we decided to focus on a few select companies who are active on Twitter and also public and what we're going to do is I sentiment analysis on the company's tweets for the past 30 days.

682
01:41:00.510 --> 01:41:01.290
Karis Jochen: And then.

683
01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:20.700
Karis Jochen: put that on a graph on as well as a graph of the company stock price to just see if there's a trend between various companies with the sentiment scores on their on their Twitter and their stock price.

684
01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:26.250
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, that sounds like it might be a little bit of work, you guys comfortable with that.

685
01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:28.050
Karis Jochen: yeah we actually.

686
01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:32.250
Karis Jochen: We actually already have most of it together we kind of.

687
01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:36.240
Karis Jochen: We we started on this a bit.

688
01:41:37.710 --> 01:41:49.650
Karis Jochen: about a week ago, and we split up and we had already split up the work and decide who's going to focus on what, and so we should be ready, well before April 27.

689
01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:55.950
Capstone Coach 1: wow wow you know what's happening here so ladies are getting organized.

690
01:41:57.330 --> 01:42:05.580
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, all right so i'm going to put you down tentatively for April, the 27th and we'll check back with you.

691
01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:14.160
Capstone Coach 1: sounds like a great project, though, looking forward to seeing what you're going to do with that will record it and some others have asked about presentation.

692
01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:24.180
Capstone Coach 1: You can just go to live, in other words DEMO be your your API or your APP and maybe a couple of slides if you want, but videos fun.

693
01:42:25.230 --> 01:42:26.010
sounds good.

694
01:42:27.690 --> 01:42:30.120
Capstone Coach 1: Monica one and Karen.

695
01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:33.210
Monica Harwig: Hello.

696
01:42:33.570 --> 01:42:34.290
Hello.

697
01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:39.000
Capstone Coach 1: Any changes any updates.

698
01:42:39.090 --> 01:42:55.080
Monica Harwig: Now, no, we and we just a divided which part of the project that we're going to do, and I think we're good to go and we're going to you know meet next week, on Sunday and, if possible, we all agreed that may would be good for us.

699
01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:57.000
Capstone Coach 1: May 4 okay.

700
01:42:58.350 --> 01:43:06.090
Capstone Coach 1: Okay well very good i'll check back with you, and if you have any questions for me at this point or.

701
01:43:06.870 --> 01:43:09.090
Capstone Coach 1: No okay good good.

702
01:43:09.450 --> 01:43:10.320
Capstone Coach 1: Thank you so much.

703
01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:14.850
Capstone Coach 1: Thank you know kimbo and Keith how about you any updates.

704
01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:26.640
Kendall Sizemore: yeah so we decided to use Google API to mark detection and for the description about that landmark we're going to be using a Wikipedia.

705
01:43:30.510 --> 01:43:39.540
Kendall Sizemore: We shouldn't have too much problems with that i'll be responsible for creating the the inner workings on the show detection.

706
01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:42.960
Kendall Sizemore: And the Wikipedia.

707
01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:44.010
Capstone Coach 1: And then.

708
01:43:44.190 --> 01:43:46.170
Kendall Sizemore: there's going to be doing the July.

709
01:43:47.490 --> 01:43:49.230
Kendall Sizemore: yeah we should be good.

710
01:43:50.970 --> 01:43:51.570
Kendall Sizemore: With going.

711
01:43:55.950 --> 01:43:59.190
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, that you dropped out of the last part there Kendall.

712
01:43:59.730 --> 01:44:01.470
Kendall Sizemore: We can go on the fourth if that's okay.

713
01:44:02.010 --> 01:44:02.550
sure.

714
01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:10.650
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, and Natasha I think I know where you guys are at.

715
01:44:11.760 --> 01:44:18.300
Capstone Coach 1: Natasha Joanna and Esther have been busy they basically are done.

716
01:44:20.430 --> 01:44:35.010
Capstone Coach 1: Except for maybe they're going to polish up the presentation, a bit, but they've got quite a presentation for everybody, looking forward to seeing what they're going to do and and tentatively put I put them on last.

717
01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:37.800
Capstone Coach 1: May 4.

718
01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.140
Natasha Chevarunotai: Oh, we don't have a choice.

719
01:44:40.830 --> 01:44:42.000
Capstone Coach 1: Do you have a choice.

720
01:44:42.810 --> 01:44:43.860
Capstone Coach 1: Is that Natasha.

721
01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:45.090
Natasha Chevarunotai: Yes, yes Natasha.

722
01:44:45.510 --> 01:44:49.050
Capstone Coach 1: Low you think about if you want, if you want to.

723
01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:51.240
Natasha Chevarunotai: yeah you.

724
01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:52.260
know.

725
01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:59.730
Capstone Coach 1: So, Brian Nicholas and Charles how about you guys any any updates any questions.

726
01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:18.180
Swanson J, Charles: No, Sir, I miss it is Charles I believe we've defined our scope and and we have a working model, we just need to Polish it a bit so we're we're good on 27th or or may 4 whichever works.

727
01:45:19.770 --> 01:45:24.420
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, I like the idea of putting putting folks up a little front and the 27th.

728
01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:35.190
Capstone Coach 1: We may have to you know juggle a little bit depending upon how many folks are going to be in that slot but i'll definitely put you there for the expectations.

729
01:45:35.280 --> 01:45:35.940
Swanson J, Charles: sounds great.

730
01:45:36.300 --> 01:45:39.210
Capstone Coach 1: Okay okay Jordan Craig and surely.

731
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:44.160
Jordan Gross: Professor.

732
01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:45.540
Jordan Gross: Yes, yeah yeah.

733
01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:53.130
Jordan Gross: So we met up we just kind of started talking about scope, making sure we're going to have a plan for when we were going to meet up and actually hashed out the development.

734
01:45:53.940 --> 01:46:01.530
Jordan Gross: We started already, or rather I should say Craig already parsed the vtt file and strings so we just kind of laid out the plan of.

735
01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:09.480
Jordan Gross: All right, Well, now we really just need to add some rejects break everything down based on where colin's appear we're times of prayer were in line breaks are.

736
01:46:10.110 --> 01:46:15.390
Jordan Gross: So we know what needs to be done and we've all done something or different pieces of it similar.

737
01:46:15.930 --> 01:46:22.230
Jordan Gross: So first meeting should be sometime early next week after all our captains are done and, depending on the scope creep.

738
01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:34.590
Jordan Gross: will depend on you know the timeframe, but one way or the other, whichever day is best for the scheduling we'd be happy to present and this scope will just be as far as we were able to push it.

739
01:46:35.100 --> 01:46:45.960
Jordan Gross: The question I guess would just be what would you consider like hey if you guys want to get an A you should at least be doing this with your vtt files, so we know that we don't mess up that.

740
01:46:46.170 --> 01:46:51.330
Jordan Gross: And then we'll start having more fun with it, but definitely knowing minimum viable products might might be.

741
01:46:51.570 --> 01:46:57.180
Capstone Coach 1: You already you already up there, that a category just by this definition of this project.

742
01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:58.650
Jordan Gross: Oh there it is.

743
01:46:58.710 --> 01:47:04.110
Capstone Coach 1: Alright, it sure anybody else that offers a nap for doing this.

744
01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:19.200
Jordan Gross: isn't necessarily a full fledged APP so there's definitely is a lot of fun potential will scale it I know Craig and I both have some experience with web Apps web applications and i'm starting to try and learn some MAC os applications as i'm transferring.

745
01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:20.310
Jordan Gross: To also.

746
01:47:20.850 --> 01:47:23.160
Capstone Coach 1: We might you might snoop around a lot bigger see if.

747
01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:23.430
Jordan Gross: I.

748
01:47:23.730 --> 01:47:25.470
Jordan Gross: alone it's terminal would be fun.

749
01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:29.850
Capstone Coach 1: yeah you might snoop around a little bit and see what the commercial potential for this would be.

750
01:47:30.450 --> 01:47:40.140
Jordan Gross: i'm almost scared to find out because i'd hate to put this on people because adding more metrics that get tracked just make a lot of people's jobs harder and a lot of people have.

751
01:47:40.530 --> 01:47:41.160
Jordan Gross: fun.

752
01:47:41.370 --> 01:47:44.730
Capstone Coach 1: making comparisons think of it that I was just wondering.

753
01:47:46.110 --> 01:47:48.630
Capstone Coach 1: If somebody I mean this sounds very useful.

754
01:47:49.650 --> 01:47:53.130
Capstone Coach 1: And if you guys pull this off, I want to copy.

755
01:47:53.580 --> 01:47:54.750
Jordan Gross: Oh absolutely well.

756
01:47:55.050 --> 01:47:57.840
Jordan Gross: To get a good grade I think we're gonna have to submit it to you so.

757
01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:00.270
We will be happy to.

758
01:48:01.530 --> 01:48:07.530
Jordan Gross: I imagine we'll get you know, at the very least a folder with a virtual environment or an environment in it and.

759
01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:12.870
Jordan Gross: If we do all the proper fun things we should we might have a github repo as well, but.

760
01:48:13.140 --> 01:48:24.600
Jordan Gross: That scope creep before we've even hit the code so i'm going to say we're going to get you know something working in terminal that parses files and gives an output of words spoken in time and that's the minimum I think after that.

761
01:48:24.630 --> 01:48:26.970
Capstone Coach 1: This is me this is fantastic I.

762
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:44.640
Capstone Coach 1: mean all of the zoom meetings and zoom educational activities that are going on right now to be able to automate some of the some of the context of all this is fantastic and then of course there's the translation thing as well, I don't think you're gonna touch that but.

763
01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:46.800
Jordan Gross: Oh, I think it like I said that's.

764
01:48:46.830 --> 01:48:56.550
Jordan Gross: That scope creep that i've learned from my own personal experiences at work, I i've been one to make some promises and then have to come back and say either I need another two weeks or you know.

765
01:48:57.150 --> 01:48:58.590
Capstone Coach 1: yeah you didn't know this is what.

766
01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:02.520
Capstone Coach 1: exactly this is, this is what I call a black hole.

767
01:49:03.690 --> 01:49:07.140
Jordan Gross: It this was one that I recognized early could very quickly.

768
01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:09.600
Capstone Coach 1: And really expand on.

769
01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:11.250
Jordan Gross: One thing at a time and.

770
01:49:11.250 --> 01:49:15.720
Jordan Gross: we'll get as far as we can with it, certainly, but whichever day you say would be best will be happy for us.

771
01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:19.320
Capstone Coach 1: Okay we're good i'll check back in then Ryan.

772
01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:21.720
Capstone Coach 1: David rather.

773
01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:22.890
David brand right.

774
01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:25.350
Capstone Coach 1: away why this yeah.

775
01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:26.310
Ryan David: that's okay.

776
01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:27.180
Ryan David: everybody gets it.

777
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:28.920
Ryan David: All right.

778
01:49:30.810 --> 01:49:37.200
Ryan David: we're good like brandon and I have capstone tomorrow so plan is to get together this weekend.

779
01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:41.310
Ryan David: You know, we feel like we have all the code it's just sort of.

780
01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:52.890
Ryan David: Extension it together getting it working doing some testing on it, so we could confident that we have on the 27th if that if.

781
01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:59.130
Capstone Coach 1: you're going to put you down there for tentatively for the 27th sure okay.

782
01:50:01.020 --> 01:50:06.180
Capstone Coach 1: Okay that's good I like to see everybody's competent getting get this done.

783
01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:10.140
Capstone Coach 1: Nathan Wilson James.

784
01:50:11.130 --> 01:50:12.330
Capstone Coach 1: The job well.

785
01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:13.980
Nathan Lippert: Yet we did.

786
01:50:14.190 --> 01:50:16.650
Nathan Lippert: We can, I think Wilson sent you over a document.

787
01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:22.920
Nathan Lippert: Okay, in James I think he's traveling the 26th and the 27th so he asked if we could do that before.

788
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:30.000
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so he's out of here on the 27th or something like or he's battling.

789
01:50:30.690 --> 01:50:31.890
Capstone Coach 1: or sorry, no.

790
01:50:32.130 --> 01:50:33.780
Capstone Coach 1: You say you guys basically.

791
01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:38.850
Capstone Coach 1: May for basically yeah okay.

792
01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:46.740
Capstone Coach 1: we're good, and I think i'm going to move James up a notch here on this slide whoops.

793
01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:54.390
Capstone Coach 1: Okay got it.

794
01:50:55.530 --> 01:51:10.890
Capstone Coach 1: All right, well thanks thanks everybody for participating in this and i'm i'm so excited that some of these presentations are going to be roughly bang bang up i'm really excited to see what you put together.

795
01:51:13.020 --> 01:51:13.320
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

796
01:51:13.950 --> 01:51:14.790
Kilani, Shadi: I have a question.

797
01:51:17.220 --> 01:51:19.890
Kilani, Shadi: Do you decide how long is the presentation.

798
01:51:21.450 --> 01:51:34.380
Capstone Coach 1: let's let's take, I have to take a look at the time frame i'm sorry, how much time we have allocated here and how many different product presentations but i'm thinking at least 15 minutes.

799
01:51:36.210 --> 01:51:46.140
Capstone Coach 1: No, you know, so if you're gonna if you're going to DEMO some of these things to DEMO the gui will take they take that long so we'll see, let me get back to you on that.

800
01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:46.800
Kilani, Shadi: Thank you.

801
01:51:47.190 --> 01:52:03.000
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, good question all right well today Okay, the exciting part of tonight we are going to talk about time series forecasting like couldn't let you get out of here without giving you some new.

802
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:15.210
Capstone Coach 1: thoughts about Python and analysis and so we're going to talk about something some of you are talked about in your presentations this is cool.

803
01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:25.470
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so if you had that time series course, and I know you all did then, you know what under reema model is that are remote pdq is a standard.

804
01:52:26.010 --> 01:52:33.900
Capstone Coach 1: Swiss army knife for fitting time series, so you, but the problem, it is, is what is P, what is T and what is cute.

805
01:52:34.410 --> 01:52:43.170
Capstone Coach 1: And these are based upon the audit correlation and partial audit correlation functions as well as the trends that might exist in the graph.

806
01:52:43.770 --> 01:52:53.970
Capstone Coach 1: So D is the difference, so you know and usually that people hope that's zero, but if you have trends in your graph you might want to take a first difference or second to see that.

807
01:52:54.780 --> 01:53:04.920
Capstone Coach 1: P amp Q have to do with the otter aggressive component P, is the number of otter aggressive terms and Q is a number of I am terms.

808
01:53:06.510 --> 01:53:18.090
Capstone Coach 1: The problem, one of the issues and one of the challenges with the riemann models is that it requires computing missing values, and it also requires regularly or evenly spaced observations.

809
01:53:18.510 --> 01:53:28.650
Capstone Coach 1: Like every day, every week or something like that, if you don't have evenly spaced data, then amputation, is a possibility, if you have missing observations.

810
01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:35.820
Capstone Coach 1: Interpretation is also a possibility to fill in that gap, but that is an extra step that's required with the remote.

811
01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:41.760
Capstone Coach 1: nice thing about arena statistical theory is rich here it's been around for some time.

812
01:53:42.090 --> 01:53:58.110
Capstone Coach 1: And so that three provides calculations forecasts with confidence intervals, and so you can get P values, and you can you can say well here's our forecasts and the accuracy is plus or minus 5% or what have you that's really useful in some ways.

813
01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:10.110
Capstone Coach 1: But in other ways, these other things are limiting and let's talk about ar one model here one model is and a remodel.

814
01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:18.450
Capstone Coach 1: Probably the most easiest one, you can have and that's the case where the next observation that time T.

815
01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:25.740
Capstone Coach 1: is basically a linear relationship with the previous observation at time T minus one.

816
01:54:26.190 --> 01:54:41.880
Capstone Coach 1: So you have an intercept you have a slope and then that slope is multiplied by that coefficient is multiplied times the previous observation on the series and, of course, you have this statistical error that's added to it now.

817
01:54:42.510 --> 01:54:48.120
Capstone Coach 1: This is where things also get a little shady with arena models you're assuming.

818
01:54:48.510 --> 01:54:57.810
Capstone Coach 1: Almost regardless of which are riemann model, you have you're assuming that the error term that you have here has zero the average value of zero.

819
01:54:58.230 --> 01:55:07.020
Capstone Coach 1: And then, a constant or you know homogeneous variance so what this says is that the residuals from this model.

820
01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:18.630
Capstone Coach 1: So we're going to get a value for the intercept that have value for the slope and then we'll be able to make predictions of the existing data and future data using this relationship.

821
01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:31.320
Capstone Coach 1: know if the average difference between y te the observation and the estimate of that observation, if that average difference is not zero.

822
01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:43.380
Capstone Coach 1: Then you have a problem, and so that's ordinarily attacked by possibly adding additional terms up here or by adding different scene that's the D number.

823
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:59.580
Capstone Coach 1: to your model another thing that's more common probably is the variation the variation of the data may change over time and over here in the Raven model we're assuming that it doesn't change it's called homogeneous variance.

824
01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:13.920
Capstone Coach 1: If we add to this a little extra complexity here is the ar to model, where we have the function of we're going to forecast the next observation.

825
01:56:14.370 --> 01:56:20.280
Capstone Coach 1: as a function of the two previous observations, and so we have a coefficient times.

826
01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:32.010
Capstone Coach 1: The previous one, and then another coefficient times something before that does observation before that so we're using the last two observations to predict the next one.

827
01:56:32.910 --> 01:56:42.960
Capstone Coach 1: We have the same assumption, so the error term that's added on the end here should have an average value of zero and the variants should be a got homogeneous or constant.

828
01:56:43.410 --> 01:56:52.800
Capstone Coach 1: Now these assumptions that you see here I primarily unnecessary to ensure that the confidence intervals, that you can calculate are accurate.

829
01:56:53.280 --> 01:57:03.750
Capstone Coach 1: But it also affects the forecasts, if this especially this one about the expectation of the average value of the error term here needs to be zero that.

830
01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:11.100
Capstone Coach 1: assumption if it's not correct that means you have a trend and the observations you know, maybe they're just going up up up.

831
01:57:11.370 --> 01:57:25.920
Capstone Coach 1: All for the entire time frame that's a That would be a trend in one way and so your expectation that the average differences zeros probably not going to hold in that case, unless you start working with first order differences that's the equal to zero.

832
01:57:27.390 --> 01:57:36.960
Capstone Coach 1: So what I just talked about is basically what you, I think I hope it was review for the Tongue series course that you had earlier.

833
01:57:37.650 --> 01:57:47.250
Capstone Coach 1: The but, in a nutshell that's what it's about it's about hitting this retrospective model where you're saying the next observation is a function of the previous observations.

834
01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:59.970
Capstone Coach 1: Now what function to us that's a challenge you know you've got to you've got to go through and figure out do I gurus when they are one do I use, and they are two or even more further back than that.

835
01:58:00.330 --> 01:58:09.450
Capstone Coach 1: Is there any seasonality in the data and that gets into questions about D, for example, if you have an annual seat seasonality.

836
01:58:09.930 --> 01:58:27.810
Capstone Coach 1: Then, and you have monthly data, then that means you're going to have a 12 month cycle that needs to be incorporated into your model, and so you want D to be one or 12 and you want the observations here the different same maybe to include T minus 12.

837
01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:31.050
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

838
01:58:32.520 --> 01:58:33.300
Now.

839
01:58:34.650 --> 01:58:47.130
Capstone Coach 1: I thought, how do you do Arriva in Python okay I don't know what you did in that course, but I hope you use Python if you do use Python then.

840
01:58:48.240 --> 01:58:50.100
Capstone Coach 1: Hopefully you use that model.

841
01:58:51.270 --> 01:59:07.350
Capstone Coach 1: You psychic learn does not have a time series model in psychic learn they have some things that help you build as a time series model, but they don't have a river and they don't have some of the other things that you might want.

842
01:59:08.610 --> 01:59:13.860
Capstone Coach 1: stats model, on the other hand, the current version of stats model this year's version.

843
01:59:14.820 --> 01:59:28.080
Capstone Coach 1: is very rich and time series analysis and so you're going all you need to do is import stats models is sm and from stats model to you see this one here in Puerto Rico.

844
01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:35.970
Capstone Coach 1: So that is the function remove function that we're trying to get to and then, if you have important that.

845
01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:55.230
Capstone Coach 1: This is all you need to do to fit a time series model in stats models, you say model is equal to a reema you give it the target vector, which is why you know that's a series that's going up and down and you want to try to protect it and then you give it values for PD and Q.

846
01:59:56.940 --> 02:00:09.780
Capstone Coach 1: oftentimes especially initially you will set to add the middle term to zero, and probably Q, also to zero, and you will play around with different values of p.

847
02:00:10.110 --> 02:00:19.080
Capstone Coach 1: This is the otter aggressive term, to see whether you could have you can use a straight ar model, there is a mathematical theorem that says.

848
02:00:19.470 --> 02:00:31.290
Capstone Coach 1: hypothetically that if you have enough of a auto regressive terms if he hears big enough, you should be able to fit anytime soon okay.

849
02:00:32.190 --> 02:00:42.150
Capstone Coach 1: Now that's not a good idea, because you don't want to have an aggressive time series with 10 terms of these are 20 terms in or something like that.

850
02:00:42.810 --> 02:00:56.370
Capstone Coach 1: you're better off to try to maybe a couple of other very aggressive terms and then maybe a couple of the moving average terms that's that's the cube term here, and maybe I do want difference of one or two might also be expected.

851
02:00:57.210 --> 02:01:04.920
Capstone Coach 1: But you can see that as far as the syntax and Python is concerned it's cool it's very simple it's not complicated.

852
02:01:05.550 --> 02:01:17.310
Capstone Coach 1: The results model that fit that gets you the results, and if you pred results summary you get the entire table of statistics for that model.

853
02:01:17.610 --> 02:01:23.970
Capstone Coach 1: And that would include P values on the coefficients in the reema model and some other information as well.

854
02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:31.470
Capstone Coach 1: If you want the predicted values you just say predict the sequel to model period predict and then in parentheses like that.

855
02:01:32.010 --> 02:01:46.110
Capstone Coach 1: So, for example, if you have a an ar ar to model, and we were just talking about an ar to model, this is all you need to do model is equal to a remote y comma order to come zero comma zero.

856
02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:55.950
Capstone Coach 1: Is that good, I think, so I think it's fairly say you know simple we're going to see that here in a minute okay I don't want you to crank up.

857
02:01:56.580 --> 02:02:10.680
Capstone Coach 1: Out of anaconda and also spider and there's a template in the week 12 folder, and that is competition that is called time series analysis stats models template.

858
02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:24.810
Capstone Coach 1: And there's also a data file that goes with this is the IBM weekly stock prices for the last since 1999 so that file is named IBM weekly price period csv.

859
02:02:25.290 --> 02:02:37.560
Capstone Coach 1: And so we're going to we're going to read this with pandas and we're going to do a time series analysis on this data in Python So if you would please open that file up.

860
02:02:38.100 --> 02:02:45.990
Capstone Coach 1: i'm going to show you in the next slide what the data actually sort of looks like like that this is the IBM closing price.

861
02:02:47.010 --> 02:02:59.790
Capstone Coach 1: Since 1999 and you can see, there are some trends here right, and so you have a trend going up this way, and then a trend coming down this way.

862
02:03:00.210 --> 02:03:12.480
Capstone Coach 1: Maybe dream is not the dnc row is not the right choice, but we can easily use that's models to figure out what the right choice is going to be for this particular data set.

863
02:03:12.930 --> 02:03:22.170
Capstone Coach 1: So this is weekly closing price from 1989 to the present all right i'm going to open up spider here and i'm going to clear off my.

864
02:03:24.660 --> 02:03:30.390
Capstone Coach 1: Well yeah clearly kernels clear all this off, so we can.

865
02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:39.690
Capstone Coach 1: Okay here's the template here it is okay, welcome to the up that are okay.

866
02:03:41.730 --> 02:03:48.420
Capstone Coach 1: I hope you have this going, and if you do have this going what i'd like you to do is type it in the following command let's see.

867
02:03:48.750 --> 02:04:06.450
Capstone Coach 1: First of all, we want in in is the number of observations and so i'm going to take in is equal to D E, F dot shape and then in square brackets zero so that'll give us the number of observations that are in this file and then we're going to set target.

868
02:04:08.220 --> 02:04:17.100
Capstone Coach 1: The variable target equal to quote close so there's a column in this file called close i'd be the closing price right.

869
02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:22.500
Capstone Coach 1: So there we get that and now let's print out.

870
02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:34.950
Capstone Coach 1: The top and bottom of the data file so just say print def like that, and now let's go up to the Green arrow and run.

871
02:04:36.510 --> 02:04:41.280
Capstone Coach 1: All right, there you go, so you can see we've got five columns in this and we have.

872
02:04:44.190 --> 02:04:57.330
Capstone Coach 1: observations or rows and the earliest, so the latest one is November the 12th 1999 and, most recently April 5 yesterday yeah okay.

873
02:04:58.110 --> 02:05:15.780
Capstone Coach 1: 2021 all right, and here you can see the closing prices back in 1989 it was $90 a share, and now, most recently $133 a share of course that's to take a 20 some years really okay.

874
02:05:18.270 --> 02:05:28.200
Capstone Coach 1: yeah you might might expect something a little bit higher after 20 Sunday, I think this or justin prices, by the way, yeah adjusted for splits and things like that, so that.

875
02:05:28.710 --> 02:05:40.800
Capstone Coach 1: Is cancel my statements I think of my big mouth is probably not correct okay So these are probably adjusted for various dividends or stock splits that kind of thing.

876
02:05:41.790 --> 02:05:49.290
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so what we want to do now is, we want to build a time series model for the closing prices that you see on great so.

877
02:05:49.680 --> 02:06:00.810
Capstone Coach 1: We have it right here, and so i'm going to say why, then, is equal to uh huh I need to have a non P array here stats models likes lumpy.

878
02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:22.170
Capstone Coach 1: And in fact psychic learn like some lumpy and other things that we're going to see charisse likes lumpy Okay, so we have to say in P for Navi period array like that, and then inside of brackets we're going to have to put def and then in square brackets target.

879
02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:40.110
Capstone Coach 1: like that, so what that does is it should, if I didn't have don't have any typos there, it will shake the value for the closing prices, you see here and and put them into why like that so let's highlight that.

880
02:06:41.700 --> 02:06:46.290
Capstone Coach 1: highlight it and then right click run the selection.

881
02:06:47.490 --> 02:06:59.340
Capstone Coach 1: Make sure that the syntax the syntax is good and then over here on the right hand side if I type why okay there we go now notice the order of these numbers.

882
02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:07.530
Capstone Coach 1: So we have the most recent data at the top and then most all and the oldest data at the bottom.

883
02:07:08.370 --> 02:07:16.710
Capstone Coach 1: We want to graph this and we want to look at this data, so we really need to reverse this, we need to reverse the order of why.

884
02:07:17.550 --> 02:07:22.980
Capstone Coach 1: And I have a little function, right here at the top, that have included in the template that does that.

885
02:07:23.790 --> 02:07:31.230
Capstone Coach 1: Now you can take a look at this, if you want to see but it's a simple thing all we're doing is taking what's on the bottom of why i'm putting it on the top.

886
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:44.400
Capstone Coach 1: And we're doing that and then returning a new value so in order to reverse Why then, what all I need to do here is type I is equal to reverse.

887
02:07:45.870 --> 02:07:47.460
Capstone Coach 1: Why like that.

888
02:07:49.170 --> 02:08:01.470
Capstone Coach 1: Now let's just select that one and tested so selected right click run boom okay let's check it here by typing in why in the IP fun window.

889
02:08:02.550 --> 02:08:18.120
Capstone Coach 1: There you go yes it's reversed so 95 is now the first and 135 is now the last observation, so we have we have old versus new last that's where we kind of wanted that.

890
02:08:20.010 --> 02:08:26.700
Capstone Coach 1: All right, well okay we're getting ready to do some calculations here.

891
02:08:27.930 --> 02:08:43.170
Capstone Coach 1: let's let's choose a value for P P, is the number of otter aggressive terms and let's use to for now, which is the order good we're just going to fit an ar to model and so i'll set the equal to zero.

892
02:08:44.430 --> 02:09:02.520
Capstone Coach 1: And i'll set Q equal to zero like that okay so it's a 200 and now i'm going to say what am I going to say here, I have to look at my slide it's something like marvel is equal to okay Rima.

893
02:09:03.750 --> 02:09:13.440
Capstone Coach 1: And then in parentheses why comma order is equal to another parenthesis P de que.

894
02:09:17.580 --> 02:09:19.350
Capstone Coach 1: So that'll give us our model.

895
02:09:21.090 --> 02:09:37.530
Capstone Coach 1: And this is sort of like what some of the things you do in Paris, where you describe what the model is but there's no real calculations going on here, then the real calculations happen happen in the next term and for them i'm going to think i'm going to say result.

896
02:09:40.230 --> 02:09:49.290
Capstone Coach 1: is equal to real actually make that plural is equal to model dot fit like that.

897
02:09:51.150 --> 02:10:03.000
Capstone Coach 1: So, first I just described what the model is, and then I asked sets models to do the calculations like that, and then we will say print.

898
02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:05.100
Capstone Coach 1: results.

899
02:10:06.300 --> 02:10:07.380
Capstone Coach 1: That summary.

900
02:10:08.940 --> 02:10:21.660
Capstone Coach 1: So interesting okay let's just redo this whole thing i'm going to go to the top and say restart the the Colonel there off the screen and then we'll hit the green arrow again.

901
02:10:22.740 --> 02:10:23.430
Capstone Coach 1: and

902
02:10:24.780 --> 02:10:28.410
Capstone Coach 1: see what happens okay there we go hit the green arrow.

903
02:10:29.820 --> 02:10:30.870
Capstone Coach 1: Oh.

904
02:10:51.150 --> 02:10:51.480
Capstone Coach 1: I think.

905
02:10:51.840 --> 02:10:53.670
Swanson J, Charles: A senior parameter for the predict.

906
02:10:54.540 --> 02:10:55.170
Capstone Coach 1: what's that.

907
02:10:55.650 --> 02:10:57.600
Swanson J, Charles: Are we missing a parameter for there.

908
02:10:58.170 --> 02:11:09.240
Capstone Coach 1: I don't think so, I think, I think, maybe you're missing that the the summary asked to have a couple of brackets at the end of it, I think I don't know, let me try this.

909
02:11:10.530 --> 02:11:11.430
Capstone Coach 1: yeah That was what.

910
02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:13.110
Capstone Coach 1: Thanks.

911
02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:26.280
Capstone Coach 1: Usually I would be missing parameters, but you know this thing is so slick the way they've designed this there, by the way, there are lots of other parameters that you can add to this.

912
02:11:26.850 --> 02:11:35.190
Capstone Coach 1: Things that deal with seasonality, for example, and other things that you don't normally use.

913
02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:46.500
Capstone Coach 1: But in the normal world where you have a single time series, and you don't have any concomitant information that you're trying to use to predict that series, this is all you need.

914
02:11:47.370 --> 02:11:54.000
Capstone Coach 1: You know so look at look at what's printed on here all right Okay, so we have the coefficients right here the.

915
02:11:54.390 --> 02:12:10.410
Capstone Coach 1: Constant is the beta zero term that you saw and there they are to model, and then we have it says ar dot l one l one stands for lag one, so this is the coefficient for T minus one.

916
02:12:11.190 --> 02:12:23.070
Capstone Coach 1: The previous observation, then you have l to for lag to coefficient for two numbers back and Sigma this is Sigma squared notice the two here.

917
02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:40.770
Capstone Coach 1: This is an estimate of the variance that you see in the model, remember, we said the variance was constant well I sure hope it's constant because they just give us one number right here 18.37 18.37.

918
02:12:41.790 --> 02:12:55.260
Capstone Coach 1: This is close to ASC the average squared error but not exactly because there's not dividing by Ian here you're dividing by in minus the number of coefficients, I believe, is what they're doing.

919
02:12:56.040 --> 02:13:04.200
Capstone Coach 1: And, and you can see here, they have the standard error for the coefficients and then they also have the test statistic Z.

920
02:13:04.650 --> 02:13:20.040
Capstone Coach 1: For the coefficients and a P value here in this call now, this would say that everything in the model is statistically significant at a 90% level the ar to term l to his.

921
02:13:20.820 --> 02:13:29.040
Capstone Coach 1: Point oh six five so it's statistically significant the 90 but not 95 I mean we're we're missing, this is not a big deal.

922
02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:43.650
Capstone Coach 1: Data science people don't really get too excited about P values, but it does tell you something here, it says that yeah we probably want at least two ar terms, maybe more.

923
02:13:44.100 --> 02:13:51.060
Capstone Coach 1: Now, this could change if we were to add a difference in here or add a moving average term in here and so forth, and so on.

924
02:13:52.260 --> 02:13:58.350
Capstone Coach 1: There is some other information in here, like, for example, the Ai see 6439.

925
02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:10.320
Capstone Coach 1: You want to minimize that number, so if you were to run a different model, maybe in using the ar three term you'd be looking to see whether they 6493 30 minutes goes down.

926
02:14:11.310 --> 02:14:22.410
Capstone Coach 1: And then you have a log likelihood term also you're trying to make that small and so you notice that it's negative so negative 3300 will be smaller than this.

927
02:14:23.370 --> 02:14:36.570
Capstone Coach 1: Okay well let's try something let's try and put P equal to three or no speaker for what the heck scope for our for model ar for model so.

928
02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:57.180
Capstone Coach 1: let's run this again i'm not going to clear the screen and the screen to run it there, we go now let's take a look what see what happened, first of all you'll see that the new terms that came in that the ar three and the or four terms are not statistically significant at a 90% level.

929
02:14:58.770 --> 02:15:10.410
Capstone Coach 1: In fact, p values are pretty large, so this would be an argument to say, maybe we shouldn't put in those say they are three and the ar for term maybe we stick with one into.

930
02:15:11.550 --> 02:15:14.490
Capstone Coach 1: notice these variants here is.

931
02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:21.660
Capstone Coach 1: And the fdic value, you can see it up there, the.

932
02:15:24.690 --> 02:15:44.520
Capstone Coach 1: let's Compare that to the previous cic value the previous cic value was 6439 smaller now what that says the ic criteria is telling you that the ar to model for these data is better for the data than the ar for model.

933
02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:54.630
Capstone Coach 1: So you have several things that are coming screaming at you and saying to us enough to is enough you don't need for okay.

934
02:15:56.220 --> 02:16:10.860
Capstone Coach 1: You have the p values and you also have the ic value, right here, and if you look at the log likelihood it's negative 3214 verses 3215 this is slightly smaller.

935
02:16:11.370 --> 02:16:20.190
Capstone Coach 1: With the ar to model so everything is pointing here to say you're better off with an ar to model okay.

936
02:16:20.910 --> 02:16:37.380
Capstone Coach 1: Really, I like to see graphs let's pay let's do some graphs okay fine, first of all let's do this prediction so i'm going to type in the next function model or the next statement he will be PR ED for prediction is equal to results.

937
02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:42.630
Capstone Coach 1: lts predict.

938
02:16:43.830 --> 02:16:51.420
Capstone Coach 1: And then he have the open and closed parentheses there and let's Let me run that mo.

939
02:16:55.560 --> 02:17:03.780
Capstone Coach 1: Just complain somethings are complaining that in Korea it ran OK, so now I, so I checked it out i'm gonna say whoops.

940
02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:06.210
Capstone Coach 1: there.

941
02:17:07.770 --> 02:17:16.710
Capstone Coach 1: OK okay over here i'm going to say P or ED in the eye Python window and you'll see the predictions, and if you type in why.

942
02:17:17.730 --> 02:17:39.570
Capstone Coach 1: you'll see that okay not bad, I mean that is the last number in Why is 135 and the prediction, there is one 130 3.7 something like that so Okay, maybe we should grab these to see if they're how close they are over that entire time frame so let's do that.

943
02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:44.790
Capstone Coach 1: you'll notice up here, I have an important statement see that guy online.

944
02:17:45.870 --> 02:17:54.990
Capstone Coach 1: Important math spotlight we're going to use math, but when I had to print or to prepare a graph of these guys right here and.

945
02:17:57.360 --> 02:18:08.820
Capstone Coach 1: At this point, let's see do I trust my memory not really okay so i'm gonna i'm gonna cheat a little bit I right i'm.

946
02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:11.640
Capstone Coach 1: Wait a second.

947
02:18:13.680 --> 02:18:18.690
Capstone Coach 1: Oh yeah, this is it okay so there's the code.

948
02:18:21.780 --> 02:18:23.070
Capstone Coach 1: Okay okay.

949
02:18:24.210 --> 02:18:30.180
Capstone Coach 1: yeah okay all right, well, I will do the plot first.

950
02:18:32.040 --> 02:18:40.020
Capstone Coach 1: So i'm going back now to my my thing here and i'm gonna i'm going to paste in some code that will do the plot for so let's take a look at the code.

951
02:18:41.970 --> 02:18:47.700
Capstone Coach 1: First of all, if I create something called a Poc list, which is just the numbers from one to n plus one.

952
02:18:49.530 --> 02:19:08.130
Capstone Coach 1: super easy to do that that's going to go on the X axis i'm not gonna put the dates down there i'm just going to put 123456 whatever right and then i'm going to say subplots big size 2020 I want a big plot, so I can see the resolution on this I got a I got a nice monster let's use it.

953
02:19:09.510 --> 02:19:28.710
Capstone Coach 1: If you're on your laptop maybe 2020 is a lot of good option, but I don't think it causes any harm to try, that this is supposed to be 20 inches by 20 it says it didn't turn out that way but yeah so then we're going to say plot subplot to one one and then we're going to say plot.

954
02:19:30.210 --> 02:19:32.550
Capstone Coach 1: Okay So here we are going to plot, the data.

955
02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:39.300
Capstone Coach 1: Any pocket list that's X comma y comma.

956
02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:53.460
Capstone Coach 1: colors equal to be for blue quote unquote label label that's the vertical axis at IBM closing price.

957
02:19:55.350 --> 02:19:55.860
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

958
02:19:57.360 --> 02:20:16.050
Capstone Coach 1: So this plot sequence that that i'm just talking about here this guy right here what it does, is it plots the time series in blue as a connected line that plot that you saw on and the PowerPoint presentation comes from this.

959
02:20:19.260 --> 02:20:20.190
Capstone Coach 1: Okay now.

960
02:20:24.270 --> 02:20:25.050
Capstone Coach 1: The next one.

961
02:20:26.850 --> 02:20:29.610
Capstone Coach 1: plt plot he park list.

962
02:20:31.380 --> 02:20:37.920
Capstone Coach 1: And Oh, I see what the problem is, it says P predict why i'm just good I misspelled that I didn't need.

963
02:20:38.250 --> 02:20:53.670
Capstone Coach 1: me to change that to piri needs to be the same name up here, this is where, in line 4040 I calculated the predicted values and so here, I want to plot the predictive values as periods as little dots little dots.

964
02:20:54.930 --> 02:20:58.830
Capstone Coach 1: And the color is going to be read, so that you can distinguish them from the blue line.

965
02:21:00.240 --> 02:21:05.910
Capstone Coach 1: And the label is predicted price and marker size tiny.

966
02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:16.080
Capstone Coach 1: Because we have over 1000 observations here and so that plots going to get pretty busy with all these dots and lines going on around it.

967
02:21:17.550 --> 02:21:21.420
Capstone Coach 1: And then you can see title, you can give it a title.

968
02:21:23.040 --> 02:21:24.330
Capstone Coach 1: And a label.

969
02:21:25.590 --> 02:21:26.370
Capstone Coach 1: Why label.

970
02:21:28.230 --> 02:21:37.710
Capstone Coach 1: And legend a legend you can you can have a legend go into the plot, and you want the font size to be smaller large I put an extra large X X large.

971
02:21:38.460 --> 02:21:56.520
Capstone Coach 1: And then finally plot show plot period show parenthesis that, basically, you know kicks off the plot, and I hope yours is this is this large enough or do I i'm I should have asked you that going back, but i'm gonna Okay, I mean see that little better.

972
02:21:58.050 --> 02:22:07.410
Capstone Coach 1: Okay now i'm going to get dangerous and i'm going to clear the Colonel just to erase all of this on the right hand side.

973
02:22:09.090 --> 02:22:16.410
Capstone Coach 1: And then we'll kick this off, and we should get our plot on this one unless there's some error in the code all right.

974
02:22:17.580 --> 02:22:25.050
Capstone Coach 1: Well, there goes, and there we go there, we go Okay, so we didn't get our plot, what do you think.

975
02:22:26.790 --> 02:22:28.470
Capstone Coach 1: not bad actually.

976
02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:39.330
Capstone Coach 1: You know, I was expecting to see the previous values in the stratosphere are we here or down here somewhere with this trend in the data like that.

977
02:22:40.980 --> 02:22:50.820
Capstone Coach 1: That the SMA look like what's what's called heterogeneous, you know time series, so we have a we have a trend up and then pretty market trend down.

978
02:22:51.990 --> 02:23:01.200
Capstone Coach 1: For IBM, and here, by the way, those of you the full of stock market, this is what's making people nervous lately, by the way.

979
02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:10.380
Capstone Coach 1: because she had the market like today, the new news on the market was no new high in the stock market it actually only went up 1%.

980
02:23:10.830 --> 02:23:20.100
Capstone Coach 1: But still, the news people new high in the stock market Well, this is what's causing problems is that, why are we getting a high in the stock market.

981
02:23:20.550 --> 02:23:29.640
Capstone Coach 1: When I made a major company like IBM is going to go into the tank and see what's happening here, so the the Dow Jones industrial average is.

982
02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:39.240
Capstone Coach 1: Basically, calculated from these fortune 500 companies and several of the fortune 500 companies are going down on lately, for this is for the last couple of months.

983
02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:46.050
Capstone Coach 1: And so everybody's thinking Oh well, what is the rest going to follow well so far it hasn't.

984
02:23:46.980 --> 02:23:53.850
Capstone Coach 1: So who knows, this is a crazy time with all this stuff going on and and then they can everything is just who knows.

985
02:23:54.240 --> 02:24:04.890
Capstone Coach 1: what's going to happen, but this curve going up and then coming down like that usually would say that you needed a take a difference in your model so let's try that.

986
02:24:05.310 --> 02:24:20.850
Capstone Coach 1: let's go over here to where it says de equal to zero and let's make that one, and you know where it says equal to Fort let's take that back to two, so now we have a 210 model that we're going to run and we'll see.

987
02:24:22.530 --> 02:24:23.580
Capstone Coach 1: How well that does.

988
02:24:25.650 --> 02:24:29.220
Capstone Coach 1: You know okay there we go kicked it off all right.

989
02:24:31.290 --> 02:24:40.530
Capstone Coach 1: So what happened oh look at the first observation, right here the bottom okay there's a C row, so it changed the scale.

990
02:24:41.190 --> 02:24:52.080
Capstone Coach 1: On the vertical axis we weren't going to like 60 and up now we're going to see a row, and the reason for that is because of persist difference, should have been set to a missing value.

991
02:24:52.650 --> 02:25:02.160
Capstone Coach 1: But instead it appears to be set to zero right, so we may want to actually exclude that from these from this observation, but.

992
02:25:02.970 --> 02:25:16.230
Capstone Coach 1: The state of before we plot this this out, but it looks like it's getting a pretty good plot if let's take a look at the statistics up here, this is really what we should be paying attention to first of all.

993
02:25:17.550 --> 02:25:19.350
Capstone Coach 1: The statistical significance.

994
02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:26.520
Capstone Coach 1: Of Okay, have a of the first and second term so it's not that impressive.

995
02:25:27.540 --> 02:25:38.790
Capstone Coach 1: And look at the Ai cvi you it's really jumped up, so what this tells me is this first difference is not a good idea, the ic value jumped up.

996
02:25:39.690 --> 02:25:57.780
Capstone Coach 1: It was 34 or something like that now it's like almost doubled so yeah you're on wait a minute i'm wrong, it was 6441, then this is what they are for models 6441 and now.

997
02:25:59.010 --> 02:26:19.350
Capstone Coach 1: Oh, it actually jumped down it actually dropped down, I was wrong about that Okay, then the likelihood is negative 30 to 11 versus negative 3214 so the likelihood appears less than it is below but they're they're sort of similar.

998
02:26:20.370 --> 02:26:25.260
Capstone Coach 1: I think you could push either one of them as a as the model, you want to use.

999
02:26:26.850 --> 02:26:32.220
Capstone Coach 1: I like to have I like the our models very simple, they are to model very simple.

1000
02:26:33.510 --> 02:26:39.360
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, any questions on this standard time series analysis with stats models.

1001
02:26:43.050 --> 02:26:43.410
Okay.

1002
02:26:44.610 --> 02:26:45.570
Capstone Coach 1: Is anybody awake.

1003
02:26:46.620 --> 02:26:47.160
Swanson J, Charles: No question.

1004
02:26:47.850 --> 02:26:49.740
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, I can't see.

1005
02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:52.890
Purkiss, David: And we wish our stats model with.

1006
02:26:52.950 --> 02:26:53.940
Purkiss, David: Class was this good.

1007
02:26:54.690 --> 02:26:57.510
Capstone Coach 1: Okay So yes, I do have a question.

1008
02:26:57.690 --> 02:26:58.140
Kilani, Shadi: I have a.

1009
02:26:58.200 --> 02:27:05.010
Capstone Coach 1: couple questions after this you know, let me ask you a question there's hang up if you already covered on this in your previous class.

1010
02:27:06.750 --> 02:27:07.590
Purkiss, David: This is better.

1011
02:27:08.340 --> 02:27:13.320
Swanson J, Charles: Okay, wait when we did time series we either did it in our.

1012
02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:18.390
Swanson J, Charles: orange oh stash so we haven't had time series in Python oh.

1013
02:27:18.420 --> 02:27:25.950
Capstone Coach 1: Beautiful Thank you, thank you, thank you because, of course, I like to stay in mixing languages, I get confused.

1014
02:27:26.610 --> 02:27:36.180
Capstone Coach 1: And you can see stats models does a pretty good job I would assume that the numbers are very comparable to so what you're going to get an ar and certainly cranked out the numbers quickly.

1015
02:27:37.170 --> 02:27:45.960
Capstone Coach 1: And the nice thing about this is we're in we're in Python so we can move this over to our other code and, like, for example, we could use.

1016
02:27:46.440 --> 02:28:01.860
Capstone Coach 1: The API Google API to pull out stock prices, and then we could do our analysis here, these these data by actually came out of the that alpha vantage code that we're using that's where I got this from so that's kind of cool.

1017
02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:12.900
Capstone Coach 1: Okay well good thanks for thanks for that feedback no not totally wasted my time here okay your time actually is your time not my time.

1018
02:28:14.070 --> 02:28:18.300
Capstone Coach 1: That I that I would be wasting if you'd already seen this in somebody's contexts.

1019
02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:35.640
Capstone Coach 1: Okay well let's crank it up a notch let's go up a notch and let's talk about let's go back to this guy right here slide number 13 and let's go to slide 14.

1020
02:28:37.290 --> 02:28:38.130
Kilani, Shadi: That phil Jones.

1021
02:28:38.670 --> 02:28:39.030
yeah.

1022
02:28:40.290 --> 02:28:42.000
Kilani, Shadi: I just had a question because.

1023
02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:48.150
Kilani, Shadi: Can we display the ACF and pcf, how do we go about doing that.

1024
02:28:49.170 --> 02:28:50.340
Capstone Coach 1: Wait a minute who's talking.

1025
02:28:50.610 --> 02:28:51.720
Kilani, Shadi: This is shadi speaking.

1026
02:28:52.530 --> 02:28:55.080
Capstone Coach 1: Oh okay i'm sorry I don't.

1027
02:28:56.790 --> 02:28:59.700
Capstone Coach 1: All right, anyway, assume was gonna tell me again.

1028
02:29:00.150 --> 02:29:02.670
Capstone Coach 1: what's your question again, can you speak up a little bit.

1029
02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:04.200
Kilani, Shadi: it's okay i'll send you an email.

1030
02:29:04.710 --> 02:29:11.970
Kilani, Shadi: Okay, and I I don't know i'll be real quick is there is there a way we can display the ACF and the PAC yes.

1031
02:29:13.290 --> 02:29:15.990
Capstone Coach 1: Yes, it really you mean in in SAS models.

1032
02:29:16.470 --> 02:29:20.610
Capstone Coach 1: Yes, so there's my goodness, they have some great functions or that yes.

1033
02:29:21.870 --> 02:29:36.090
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, they will it will produce it produces those functions I I didn't have time to look at it today, as far as plotting them is concerned, you may have to use the you probably will have to use the same plot routine we were just going through.

1034
02:29:37.440 --> 02:29:51.660
Capstone Coach 1: yeah So yes, definitely you can then and, in fact, normally, you would look directly at the audit correlation and the partial article relation functions to see what makes sense in terms of the model right.

1035
02:29:51.930 --> 02:29:53.100
Kilani, Shadi: Exactly so yeah.

1036
02:29:53.310 --> 02:30:09.510
Capstone Coach 1: That was very important okay now let's put on the new let's put on our new aggie hat that says, I know data analysis right data mining and whatever you want to call it so we're going to talk about modern approaches to time series modeling okay.

1037
02:30:10.650 --> 02:30:22.650
Capstone Coach 1: So we're not we're not going to exactly drop the ar model, the air model is or even model is useful for understanding the mechanisms that generate the serious right.

1038
02:30:23.010 --> 02:30:31.140
Capstone Coach 1: For example, do I need to record data, all the way back to eternity or are we just going to go back to a week or two weeks or whatever it is.

1039
02:30:31.620 --> 02:30:40.380
Capstone Coach 1: And difference from there, so the remote approach allows you to understand structurally what's going on in your series a little better.

1040
02:30:41.160 --> 02:30:50.040
Capstone Coach 1: Now we're gonna we're now we're going to take the blind computer approach okay so we're on Mars and we're a computer and we captured all this data.

1041
02:30:50.340 --> 02:30:57.240
Capstone Coach 1: We don't have a person to look at the graphs to see whether the ar function is needed, or what have you, what are we going to do.

1042
02:30:57.750 --> 02:31:14.280
Capstone Coach 1: we're going to use deep learning to figure out how to how to forecast that series why we're going to do that because it's extremely robust against all of those assumptions they talk to you about in time series modeling missing data, not a problem.

1043
02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:20.640
Capstone Coach 1: In irregular time sequences not a problem.

1044
02:31:22.710 --> 02:31:28.260
Capstone Coach 1: You know, lack of homogeneity a variance not a problem okay.

1045
02:31:29.130 --> 02:31:37.710
Capstone Coach 1: How does this happen, well, there are three different deep learning approaches to time series modeling and tonight we're going to talk about the first one.

1046
02:31:38.070 --> 02:31:51.510
Capstone Coach 1: Which is multi layer preceptor on neural network and other words charisse this is charisse right here, so we use carousel and was images why can't we use cameras to predict the stock prices, we can.

1047
02:31:52.590 --> 02:32:03.210
Capstone Coach 1: And we're going to look at three different approaches to doing that tonight we're going to look at the traditional nlp neural network and the next time we'll look at the recurrent neural network and lstm.

1048
02:32:04.020 --> 02:32:16.920
Capstone Coach 1: A little bit later after that so let's see how this works well next slide please download and open up there's another Python template time series analysis.

1049
02:32:17.370 --> 02:32:30.270
Capstone Coach 1: underscore m LP template P, why and then we're going to use the same data we're going to do the same thing we just did except now we're going to use neural network to make the time series forecast.

1050
02:32:31.440 --> 02:32:32.010
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

1051
02:32:33.750 --> 02:32:43.170
Capstone Coach 1: How do we do that alright well look the open up that file and see what it looks like and we'll get to work on that this is.

1052
02:32:44.850 --> 02:32:52.920
Capstone Coach 1: Now this is the template right here and you'll see there more imports, stop the, these are all the carriers imports right.

1053
02:32:53.850 --> 02:33:03.780
Capstone Coach 1: charisse is very proud of their package so they got all these things we need to import here, and so we just going to import all that care of stuff and then we also.

1054
02:33:04.620 --> 02:33:13.710
Capstone Coach 1: Well, in this particular case, I brought in the psychic learn and we didn't didn't really need that don't really need that here.

1055
02:33:15.180 --> 02:33:28.230
Capstone Coach 1: At, but we do need this up top here the Navi the pandas the math routine and the math plot routine right here so we're going to be using all of this and will be using careless.

1056
02:33:29.610 --> 02:33:42.000
Capstone Coach 1: Okay at the top of the besides the imports, right after the imports, there are a couple of functions, one of them is called reverse this is the same function, we just saw it just turns the it turns the vector around.

1057
02:33:42.570 --> 02:33:51.570
Capstone Coach 1: Instead of first you know first the last it's going to go last to first and then there's a new function called lags.

1058
02:33:52.530 --> 02:34:01.440
Capstone Coach 1: And this is the key, this is the key and important key to making this work we're going to create lags of why.

1059
02:34:02.100 --> 02:34:09.720
Capstone Coach 1: So we're going to take the vector why the you know the why observations and we're going to put right next to it the first lack.

1060
02:34:10.380 --> 02:34:18.360
Capstone Coach 1: So each observation will have next to it, the immediately predicted the previous observation that would be a lag one.

1061
02:34:18.990 --> 02:34:28.170
Capstone Coach 1: And then we'll put it in another column, and then we'll have the second guy back so we're going to lag why several times.

1062
02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:45.510
Capstone Coach 1: And each time we create one of these new columns it'll be lacked let's see how that works Okay, so you can see up front, we are doing the same thing here we're printing off we're reading the the pandas data frame we're going to say in is equal to.

1063
02:34:46.770 --> 02:34:48.690
Capstone Coach 1: def dot shape.

1064
02:34:50.100 --> 02:34:53.370
Capstone Coach 1: Zero again and we will say target.

1065
02:34:54.690 --> 02:34:58.110
Capstone Coach 1: is equal to close again right.

1066
02:34:59.280 --> 02:35:01.530
Capstone Coach 1: And let's see now.

1067
02:35:02.670 --> 02:35:09.150
Capstone Coach 1: Then we're going to say why is equal to def and then in parentheses here target.

1068
02:35:11.850 --> 02:35:12.600
Capstone Coach 1: like that.

1069
02:35:14.610 --> 02:35:15.300
Capstone Coach 1: and

1070
02:35:17.310 --> 02:35:38.010
Capstone Coach 1: Oh, I didn't do that right, this is, this is a no no yeah if I did this, I did I end up with a pandas series in why I want to not be array so I enclose that data frame thing and NP period, by the way, I can do this.

1071
02:35:40.080 --> 02:35:53.490
Capstone Coach 1: You know what am I thinking of there we go Okay, so I have the NP period array and then in in open or close parenthesis def and then brackets target, so this will create a lumpy.

1072
02:35:54.510 --> 02:36:02.190
Capstone Coach 1: series basically and why and then we're going to reverse y is equal to reverse.

1073
02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:15.120
Capstone Coach 1: Why like that turned it around let's run this as it is just to make sure that we're in the don't have any errors lurking in the back.

1074
02:36:15.930 --> 02:36:34.470
Capstone Coach 1: Somewhere so okay there it is it read it in the printed out and no errors came out that's good i'm going to go over here to the Python window and type why just to make sure yep there it is it's reversed okay we're good we're good now.

1075
02:36:36.600 --> 02:36:40.920
Capstone Coach 1: Next, I want to do is, I want to create some lag sub why.

1076
02:36:41.940 --> 02:36:44.460
Capstone Coach 1: Okay let's see how I do that.

1077
02:36:45.570 --> 02:37:09.090
Capstone Coach 1: notice the lag function up here, I give it why, and then a period that period would be the the the degree of a lag So if I if I say let's, let me say he see X one for the lag one no less less yeah that's okay and use X one or you can use the old one.

1078
02:37:10.140 --> 02:37:24.240
Capstone Coach 1: Whatever makes sense to you i'm using X one is equal to, and it's going to be lags what oh la GS and then open close parentheses y comma one like that.

1079
02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:35.250
Capstone Coach 1: So that'll create the first leg and next one let's just run that line, right now, and you can see what will happen so hopefully I don't have any bugs in the little Program.

1080
02:37:35.670 --> 02:37:48.480
Capstone Coach 1: So over here in the I Python window I have X one let's type X one and see what happens OK notice the first entry and X one is any in which is nothing missing.

1081
02:37:49.590 --> 02:38:01.200
Capstone Coach 1: And that's because I can't I don't have a there is nothing before, and the first observation 95.87 so we get a missing day for the for the lag the next one.

1082
02:38:01.860 --> 02:38:17.160
Capstone Coach 1: Is 95.87 so for the second observation, the lag is the first observation and then for the third observation, the lag would be the second you see how that works, so this is why that you see up here.

1083
02:38:17.640 --> 02:38:29.520
Capstone Coach 1: 9500 and 305 and so forth, and so on, and then the lag well it you imagine taking this vector and just shifting it shifting it to the right one number.

1084
02:38:30.030 --> 02:38:37.980
Capstone Coach 1: And that means, so we have a missing value here this number becomes over here this guy goes over here that's what's happening that's flag one.

1085
02:38:39.300 --> 02:38:55.650
Capstone Coach 1: And then, what we're going to do on the, this is the, this is the bottom line we're going to create the order regressive lags you see what we're doing here and then we're going to send them through a traditional dense neural network, the LP now neural network.

1086
02:38:56.790 --> 02:38:59.520
Capstone Coach 1: So it the code gets a little.

1087
02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:22.170
Capstone Coach 1: Long but it's going to be, it should look very familiar to you, because this is what we did with the images as well, we did with some other things okay so X two, then, is equal to lags and then y comma to two second lag like that.

1088
02:39:23.550 --> 02:39:33.000
Capstone Coach 1: So I have, I have the ability, here, to fit a or two model if I want you and.

1089
02:39:34.530 --> 02:39:39.000
Capstone Coach 1: let's go ahead and make X three equal two legs.

1090
02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:41.820
Capstone Coach 1: Why come to three.

1091
02:39:43.410 --> 02:39:46.560
Capstone Coach 1: And then X for equal two legs.

1092
02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:54.300
Capstone Coach 1: Why come on for like that okay well not 40 ooh.

1093
02:39:55.770 --> 02:39:58.890
Capstone Coach 1: that's not good not good for there you go alright.

1094
02:40:00.840 --> 02:40:01.440
Capstone Coach 1: So.

1095
02:40:02.820 --> 02:40:03.600
Capstone Coach 1: pretty good there.

1096
02:40:05.100 --> 02:40:23.310
Capstone Coach 1: So at this point, if you could run it make sure that we don't have any typos really it should just boom boom like that, and no error messages, if you don't hear messages, maybe miss type the misspelled lags or something like that that's what I do forget the S.

1097
02:40:24.540 --> 02:40:24.870
Capstone Coach 1: Right.

1098
02:40:26.370 --> 02:40:27.930
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so.

1099
02:40:30.510 --> 02:40:32.790
Capstone Coach 1: All right, hang on just a second here.

1100
02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:38.160
Capstone Coach 1: I want to make sure that i've got all the code right.

1101
02:40:42.540 --> 02:40:43.290
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

1102
02:40:55.500 --> 02:41:01.050
Capstone Coach 1: Okay we're good we're good i've got i've got some extra code in there, that I don't really need to have.

1103
02:41:13.020 --> 02:41:14.100
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so.

1104
02:41:20.550 --> 02:41:20.940
All right.

1105
02:41:27.090 --> 02:41:33.690
Capstone Coach 1: Okay let's go down after the X for here and now we're going to type into new statements.

1106
02:41:35.100 --> 02:41:49.530
Capstone Coach 1: we're going to say Z now, this is a not be column stack and then you simply put X one X two X, three and four there what that does is it it stacks up the.

1107
02:41:50.580 --> 02:42:00.300
Capstone Coach 1: The column we've created these lag columns I want to put this now into an array where the first column is like one, the second column is like to third column and fourth call.

1108
02:42:01.140 --> 02:42:09.480
Capstone Coach 1: Send that's called lumpy period column underscore stack so it takes separate columns and just put some together like that.

1109
02:42:10.680 --> 02:42:16.710
Capstone Coach 1: And then i'm i'm going to create an ex my independent variable here.

1110
02:42:17.970 --> 02:42:18.720
Capstone Coach 1: and

1111
02:42:20.070 --> 02:42:20.550
Capstone Coach 1: hmm.

1112
02:42:21.690 --> 02:42:22.320
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

1113
02:42:25.860 --> 02:42:31.830
Capstone Coach 1: We won't do that we're just going to say X is equal to Z.

1114
02:42:32.940 --> 02:42:33.570
Capstone Coach 1: and

1115
02:42:35.730 --> 02:42:46.890
Capstone Coach 1: we're going to say that it's a lie it's going to start at the number of legs I didn't write number of blacks so the number of up your let's go up here and write in likes.

1116
02:42:47.970 --> 02:42:50.730
Capstone Coach 1: equals to for we're taking four legs.

1117
02:42:51.900 --> 02:43:02.040
Capstone Coach 1: You could do this nicer you could actually have this generated in the loop, and you know, make the code, a little more efficient, but I think it's easier to want to follow this way.

1118
02:43:02.700 --> 02:43:13.770
Capstone Coach 1: So the number of legs so we're using this for and I first put them all together, like that, and then I chop off the bottom, where I have all of the missing values.

1119
02:43:14.820 --> 02:43:27.030
Capstone Coach 1: And I do that by just saying take everything from in legs forward those other ones behind our have missing values in them, and I want to drop that.

1120
02:43:28.260 --> 02:43:33.540
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so you're only dropping you're dropping the first four observations basically.

1121
02:43:34.800 --> 02:43:42.000
Capstone Coach 1: In this case with the for dropping the first so that would be calling, you know the road 0123 basically.

1122
02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:44.910
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, and.

1123
02:43:47.490 --> 02:43:50.400
Capstone Coach 1: All right, and you already have why set up like that.

1124
02:43:53.220 --> 02:43:53.760
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

1125
02:43:55.080 --> 02:44:00.270
Capstone Coach 1: let's see where Am I oh that's the previous Oh, here it is yeah okay.

1126
02:44:05.610 --> 02:44:06.270
Capstone Coach 1: So.

1127
02:44:07.980 --> 02:44:09.720
Capstone Coach 1: Alright let's show you what the.

1128
02:44:10.860 --> 02:44:16.170
Capstone Coach 1: neural network is and i'm going to use here i'm just going to copy and paste this in place.

1129
02:44:17.730 --> 02:44:18.270
Capstone Coach 1: and

1130
02:44:19.530 --> 02:44:24.690
Capstone Coach 1: Going at the bottom, so now we're ready to do our nlp neural network.

1131
02:44:25.920 --> 02:44:26.610
Capstone Coach 1: like that.

1132
02:44:27.960 --> 02:44:39.660
Capstone Coach 1: So i'm setting the random number see that was do that whoops I have to these are out of the backspace on that so i'm setting the random number seed right here.

1133
02:44:41.790 --> 02:44:45.120
Capstone Coach 1: And then I say model is equal to models start sequential.

1134
02:44:46.500 --> 02:44:47.820
Capstone Coach 1: and see how that works.

1135
02:44:50.100 --> 02:45:01.230
Capstone Coach 1: And then layer one layer two and layer three layer one in this context i'm only using 20% transcend the first layer, because how many inputs do I have only have four.

1136
02:45:02.370 --> 02:45:18.090
Capstone Coach 1: I have the four legged values of why X 123 and four so don't it's not like the photograph thing, where you had thousands of pixels and so you had to have a huge number of perceptions in that first layer to accept those pixels.

1137
02:45:19.260 --> 02:45:32.520
Capstone Coach 1: know here we just have really just four inputs and so 20 actually maybe two large I don't know I haven't really played with this that much so, but I do know that this will get us going for sure.

1138
02:45:33.960 --> 02:45:40.500
Capstone Coach 1: The the input dimension is for in lacks the input dimension is for got four columns.

1139
02:45:41.610 --> 02:45:43.470
Capstone Coach 1: Colonel regularization.

1140
02:45:45.780 --> 02:45:46.470
Capstone Coach 1: me a.

1141
02:45:51.870 --> 02:45:52.890
Capstone Coach 1: Little over a little bit.

1142
02:45:54.480 --> 02:46:00.300
Capstone Coach 1: Activity regularization activation i'm going to use Arc tension ta n h.

1143
02:46:01.650 --> 02:46:03.330
Capstone Coach 1: Instead of Arielle you.

1144
02:46:04.410 --> 02:46:14.940
Capstone Coach 1: Part of the reason there is Arielle you his favorite mainly because it's very, very fast and when you're doing put analyze your photographs the thousands of parameters millions.

1145
02:46:15.780 --> 02:46:31.290
Capstone Coach 1: You what you can't take time to calculate this kind of a number, so this is a good thing to do, but it does take time So here we have a smaller network it'll it'll definitely get done quickly.

1146
02:46:32.370 --> 02:46:37.260
Capstone Coach 1: The second layer is also hidden layer as for precept tron Senate.

1147
02:46:38.370 --> 02:46:41.490
Capstone Coach 1: Everything else is the same except, there is no input dimension.

1148
02:46:42.630 --> 02:46:43.590
Capstone Coach 1: For the second layer

1149
02:46:48.960 --> 02:46:50.010
Capstone Coach 1: The third layer

1150
02:46:53.010 --> 02:47:07.830
Capstone Coach 1: One preceptor on yes, because we're we're forecasting and interval variable that's why and there's only one why, in this case now if you were trying to if you had multiple time series.

1151
02:47:08.850 --> 02:47:20.220
Capstone Coach 1: And maybe they were different from one another, but you are thinking that their code one time series impacts another they're related in some way right.

1152
02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:27.270
Capstone Coach 1: Then, this would be cool because all you have to do is change the number of preceptor ons here from one.

1153
02:47:27.900 --> 02:47:40.710
Capstone Coach 1: To the number of outputs that you have now in that case, why would not be a single column or a single series, but it would be several columns each one maybe containing different information.

1154
02:47:41.430 --> 02:47:58.170
Capstone Coach 1: So we could, for example with we wanted to this would be unusual, but you see how we have high low and closing prices, we could forecast all three of those simultaneously, obviously, the high and low prices are going to be.

1155
02:47:59.430 --> 02:48:11.220
Capstone Coach 1: related to the closing price, the low price will be the closing price will be a number between the suit right so in there, they are inherently close together.

1156
02:48:12.720 --> 02:48:23.040
Capstone Coach 1: Another approach or more realistic might be to forecast closing price with volume two series like that so you'd have another another number here.

1157
02:48:25.320 --> 02:48:32.220
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, and then you add layer one you add layer to add layer three and model summary that's it.

1158
02:48:33.960 --> 02:48:35.910
Capstone Coach 1: So if I run this right now.

1159
02:48:36.450 --> 02:48:38.370
Coleman, Clay: Your layer two is commented out what.

1160
02:48:40.050 --> 02:48:41.070
Capstone Coach 1: We are to.

1161
02:48:41.160 --> 02:48:42.000
Coleman, Clay: Online 78.

1162
02:48:44.370 --> 02:48:47.910
Capstone Coach 1: Oh yeah yeah oh gee wow Okay, thank you.

1163
02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:56.490
Capstone Coach 1: I don't know why that's okay so let's just try it like there you go all right does that better.

1164
02:48:58.770 --> 02:48:59.520
Capstone Coach 1: said, David.

1165
02:49:02.760 --> 02:49:04.110
Coleman, Clay: It was like okay.

1166
02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:07.440
Capstone Coach 1: So.

1167
02:49:10.170 --> 02:49:26.820
Capstone Coach 1: All right, so we have 100 989 parameters not million 5 million like were you dealing with on the last example hundred and 89 we can rip through that so let's set the number of the box here.

1168
02:49:27.990 --> 02:49:30.240
Capstone Coach 1: So we're going to say eat box.

1169
02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:34.290
Capstone Coach 1: equal to 20.

1170
02:49:35.310 --> 02:49:36.450
Capstone Coach 1: And size.

1171
02:49:37.500 --> 02:49:39.810
Capstone Coach 1: equal to eight.

1172
02:49:41.670 --> 02:49:53.070
Capstone Coach 1: going to use a small number because that's going to force us to look at smaller batches and it'll take that we don't normally do that because it takes a lot more time, but this is a small data set so.

1173
02:49:55.380 --> 02:49:55.950
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

1174
02:50:02.460 --> 02:50:03.480
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

1175
02:50:08.130 --> 02:50:09.810
Capstone Coach 1: Let me show you the next few lines here.

1176
02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:12.870
Capstone Coach 1: Pretty straightforward.

1177
02:50:15.270 --> 02:50:15.930
Capstone Coach 1: There we go.

1178
02:50:17.310 --> 02:50:20.160
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, I made a typo somewhere we'll fix that.

1179
02:50:22.710 --> 02:50:23.460
Capstone Coach 1: Oh yeah.

1180
02:50:25.980 --> 02:50:28.680
Capstone Coach 1: These were indented and they shouldn't event.

1181
02:50:30.060 --> 02:50:40.500
Capstone Coach 1: Okay you're going to print out the federal network with so many parks and the batch size of whatever just basically repeating that Oh, we got 20 pox on size of a.

1182
02:50:41.250 --> 02:50:53.280
Capstone Coach 1: history of secret the model dot fit X comma y E boxes equal to eat box batch size equal to size verbose as to what can watch what's happening here.

1183
02:50:55.170 --> 02:50:57.480
Capstone Coach 1: The history dictionary is history history.

1184
02:50:58.500 --> 02:51:03.030
Capstone Coach 1: As he average score to remember that from SAS you see.

1185
02:51:04.140 --> 02:51:12.840
Capstone Coach 1: That in inside of care us they have something called msc mean squared error that's the same thing as a SEC.

1186
02:51:13.710 --> 02:51:29.850
Capstone Coach 1: And if you want to pull it out, this is how you pull it out so as equal to the last term in that history dictionary each epoch you're going to see the msc coming out and the last one, is what we print out as a SEC.

1187
02:51:31.110 --> 02:51:37.050
Capstone Coach 1: And then I like to calculate the root of the square root of a SEC and print that out as well.

1188
02:51:38.400 --> 02:51:42.570
Capstone Coach 1: And because the square root is more like a plus or minus number.

1189
02:51:43.650 --> 02:51:51.300
Capstone Coach 1: I can, I can think in those terms, oh it's plus or minus five or dollars or plus or minus $10 What is it all right.

1190
02:51:53.400 --> 02:51:58.860
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, now I I hope you're you're with me at this point, if you are plus run.

1191
02:52:01.050 --> 02:52:03.540
Capstone Coach 1: i'm going to press run ooh.

1192
02:52:07.320 --> 02:52:11.280
Capstone Coach 1: OK now let's see what is it complaining about.

1193
02:52:13.500 --> 02:52:13.920
Okay.

1194
02:52:18.330 --> 02:52:21.150
Capstone Coach 1: You must compile your model before you do this.

1195
02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:24.420
Capstone Coach 1: Oh.

1196
02:52:28.560 --> 02:52:33.090
Capstone Coach 1: I thought I did, that this is compiling the model is up here.

1197
02:52:36.390 --> 02:52:36.780
Capstone Coach 1: Oh.

1198
02:52:39.030 --> 02:52:44.220
Capstone Coach 1: Really okay well wait a moment, let me, let me try to restart.

1199
02:52:46.410 --> 02:52:48.180
Capstone Coach 1: And then what's that.

1200
02:52:54.870 --> 02:52:59.370
Capstone Coach 1: something strange on my screen, I must have done something with soon.

1201
02:53:00.480 --> 02:53:02.850
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so i'm going to hit run.

1202
02:53:05.370 --> 02:53:06.030
Capstone Coach 1: and

1203
02:53:11.220 --> 02:53:15.240
Capstone Coach 1: So i'm getting up here through a model summary.

1204
02:53:27.720 --> 02:53:32.160
Capstone Coach 1: Oh, I didn't comply he's there right, I did not compile the model.

1205
02:53:35.220 --> 02:53:36.120
Capstone Coach 1: So.

1206
02:53:37.290 --> 02:53:41.940
Capstone Coach 1: Let me grab that statement, the model compilers well I missing actually.

1207
02:53:43.080 --> 02:53:44.460
Capstone Coach 1: A couple of lines here.

1208
02:53:45.690 --> 02:53:46.320
Capstone Coach 1: and

1209
02:53:47.940 --> 02:53:49.410
Capstone Coach 1: So i'm going to go back here.

1210
02:53:50.640 --> 02:53:56.100
Capstone Coach 1: and put them in at this just just put them in before the box here.

1211
02:53:57.390 --> 02:53:58.590
Capstone Coach 1: you'll see what it is.

1212
02:53:59.640 --> 02:54:02.790
Capstone Coach 1: So you decide to find the optimizer in this case it's.

1213
02:54:04.380 --> 02:54:05.430
Capstone Coach 1: At a delta.

1214
02:54:06.570 --> 02:54:13.320
Capstone Coach 1: And then model dot compile losses mean squared error optimizer soapy T.

1215
02:54:15.210 --> 02:54:18.150
Capstone Coach 1: And the metrics msc need square there.

1216
02:54:19.710 --> 02:54:21.360
Capstone Coach 1: For this is a little different than that.

1217
02:54:23.550 --> 02:54:24.720
Capstone Coach 1: You know binary.

1218
02:54:25.890 --> 02:54:28.440
Capstone Coach 1: categorical or loss or.

1219
02:54:29.820 --> 02:54:33.900
Capstone Coach 1: categorical loss cross entropy loss.

1220
02:54:36.990 --> 02:54:38.940
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so let's run that.

1221
02:54:43.800 --> 02:55:02.130
Capstone Coach 1: Oh, oh I forgot to chop why I chopped X is that by the end lacks but I didn't chop why so up here I chopped X like that, and what I need to do is do the same thing here on why the sequel to.

1222
02:55:05.550 --> 02:55:09.870
Capstone Coach 1: Why, and then in underscore legs.

1223
02:55:12.690 --> 02:55:14.220
Capstone Coach 1: All the way forward so.

1224
02:55:16.290 --> 02:55:16.890
Capstone Coach 1: like that.

1225
02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:19.740
Capstone Coach 1: and

1226
02:55:21.690 --> 02:55:31.950
Capstone Coach 1: that's the observation there just before the random set seed and let her run that just to make sure yeah no love no errors in that statement.

1227
02:55:34.050 --> 02:55:34.620
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

1228
02:55:36.120 --> 02:55:42.870
Capstone Coach 1: So let's hit the run button on the top again okay there we go robots ripping off okay good good.

1229
02:55:44.070 --> 02:55:44.490
Capstone Coach 1: huh.

1230
02:55:46.410 --> 02:55:53.700
Capstone Coach 1: Results to large he is see 34 overflow error it's this guy right here.

1231
02:55:55.080 --> 02:55:56.670
Capstone Coach 1: The route squared error.

1232
02:55:58.470 --> 02:56:05.460
Capstone Coach 1: As he is too large, so the loss function here is basically 4729.

1233
02:56:06.960 --> 02:56:09.840
Capstone Coach 1: And you can see it's not a good fit at all right.

1234
02:56:12.060 --> 02:56:16.140
Capstone Coach 1: Well, if you could see that so let's tell me tell you what's wrong here.

1235
02:56:17.820 --> 02:56:19.410
Capstone Coach 1: i'm using the Alpha Delta.

1236
02:56:20.550 --> 02:56:35.580
Capstone Coach 1: function to optimize this and the learning rate is to write watch what happens if we change this learning rate to something like one just drop it down one and rerun it.

1237
02:56:40.500 --> 02:56:42.210
Capstone Coach 1: Well, not much happened.

1238
02:56:44.250 --> 02:56:47.430
Capstone Coach 1: hmm let's change that to.

1239
02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:51.480
Capstone Coach 1: 0.001.

1240
02:56:56.250 --> 02:57:06.360
Capstone Coach 1: Up it's still too big okay it's even worse okay well let's let's that's Bandon at a delta so i'm going to comment that out.

1241
02:57:06.870 --> 02:57:19.410
Capstone Coach 1: And we're going to use that Adam instead so add an op to sequel to add them and then they're the learning rate is point 001 and the epsilon value is one eating minus four.

1242
02:57:22.230 --> 02:57:38.190
Capstone Coach 1: So what I found in in experimenting with this today was that the Alpha delta optimizer that works so well with the images really does not work well with this time series at all let's see what happens with the atom.

1243
02:57:40.140 --> 02:57:42.990
Capstone Coach 1: let's still the super last functions to large.

1244
02:57:44.970 --> 02:57:47.730
Capstone Coach 1: Did I mess up something let's let's check out why.

1245
02:57:52.470 --> 02:57:53.550
Capstone Coach 1: and check out.

1246
02:57:55.980 --> 02:57:56.400
Capstone Coach 1: See.

1247
02:58:00.570 --> 02:58:01.260
Capstone Coach 1: X.

1248
02:58:04.890 --> 02:58:05.760
Capstone Coach 1: X shape.

1249
02:58:06.870 --> 02:58:07.560
Capstone Coach 1: This good.

1250
02:58:09.450 --> 02:58:10.020
Capstone Coach 1: shape is.

1251
02:58:21.300 --> 02:58:21.990
James Kramer: dishwasher.

1252
02:58:29.550 --> 02:58:30.090
Capstone Coach 1: James.

1253
02:58:33.870 --> 02:58:34.800
James Kramer: making things.

1254
02:58:42.450 --> 02:58:44.610
James Kramer: happen just making sure.

1255
02:59:07.980 --> 02:59:11.820
Capstone Coach 1: put some graphics at the bottom of this to see what was going on.

1256
02:59:25.380 --> 02:59:27.750
Capstone Coach 1: And upload this to the.

1257
02:59:34.860 --> 02:59:35.790
Capstone Coach 1: To the website.

1258
02:59:43.350 --> 02:59:46.680
Capstone Coach 1: or restart to Colonel make sure everything's cleared out.

1259
02:59:50.460 --> 02:59:52.680
Purkiss, David: How to gather everything highlighted Dr Jones.

1260
03:00:01.170 --> 03:00:04.500
Capstone Coach 1: You don't think I have everything highlighted on me i'm sorry, what do you mean.

1261
03:00:05.280 --> 03:00:08.490
Purkiss, David: When you ran that you didn't have all the code highlighted.

1262
03:00:09.930 --> 03:00:10.290
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

1263
03:00:13.710 --> 03:00:14.850
Capstone Coach 1: Well, I was trying to just.

1264
03:00:16.290 --> 03:00:16.710
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

1265
03:00:18.540 --> 03:00:21.630
Capstone Coach 1: So let's see how this is gonna work perfect.

1266
03:00:25.380 --> 03:00:26.280
Capstone Coach 1: should work.

1267
03:00:30.420 --> 03:00:33.120
Capstone Coach 1: Okay there's something wrong here.

1268
03:00:34.470 --> 03:00:37.200
Capstone Coach 1: With the last calculate the last calculation.

1269
03:00:39.390 --> 03:00:42.690
Capstone Coach 1: Let me right, let me run the other code just for a second see.

1270
03:00:45.720 --> 03:00:46.410
Capstone Coach 1: What happened.

1271
03:00:48.510 --> 03:00:57.240
Capstone Coach 1: yeah she other Code, the code runs fine, this is a, this is what you get when you run the other coders so there's some difference between.

1272
03:00:59.100 --> 03:01:00.330
Capstone Coach 1: The two versions.

1273
03:01:06.420 --> 03:01:10.080
Capstone Coach 1: Oh i'm taking the log here, in this case.

1274
03:01:14.640 --> 03:01:15.210
Capstone Coach 1: But.

1275
03:01:18.600 --> 03:01:28.260
Capstone Coach 1: Okay well i'm going to do is i'm going to do i'm going to upload this right now to the to the website so you can see what it's doing and.

1276
03:01:29.100 --> 03:01:43.710
Capstone Coach 1: i'm going to ask you i'm going to post a little little bit of an assignment, which is basically to play with this code to get this to fit, you can see what's going on here with the neural network and see how that see how it's missing.

1277
03:01:44.790 --> 03:02:06.030
Capstone Coach 1: Now, the reason that this is not overland the data as well the predictive predictions are the red dots your see and then the blue is the actual data and the reason we're off here is because of one of two things the optimizer the learning rate for the optimizer and couldn't be off.

1278
03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:16.980
Capstone Coach 1: So yeah in this case i'm using that a delta now what washes what's up I changed to the atom here.

1279
03:02:18.600 --> 03:02:19.890
Capstone Coach 1: And you'll see that.

1280
03:02:22.110 --> 03:02:25.110
Capstone Coach 1: happens boom that's still not very good.

1281
03:02:27.450 --> 03:02:32.940
Capstone Coach 1: So the other thing that you can work with is the number of sub tron such are using in the network.

1282
03:02:34.320 --> 03:02:35.100
Capstone Coach 1: and

1283
03:02:36.840 --> 03:02:44.430
Capstone Coach 1: The type of activation and so forth, so your homework basically your homework, will be to get this looking better and.

1284
03:02:46.080 --> 03:03:05.370
Capstone Coach 1: The find out what the key to that is right now, by the way, one of the keys is to use the logarithm of the price of the of the instead of the actual value so that you're working with smaller numbers than the larger, so this is actually a log scale on the left hand said log linear scale.

1285
03:03:07.530 --> 03:03:09.090
Capstone Coach 1: Okay um.

1286
03:03:10.350 --> 03:03:16.230
Capstone Coach 1: So we're done for tonight i'm going to see where are we here.

1287
03:03:18.360 --> 03:03:19.140
Capstone Coach 1: that's that's great.

1288
03:03:41.970 --> 03:03:43.440
Capstone Coach 1: Just like I lost my connection.

1289
03:03:48.180 --> 03:03:50.040
Capstone Coach 1: With the week 11 folder.

1290
03:03:52.080 --> 03:03:53.280
Capstone Coach 1: So i'm going to.

1291
03:04:43.050 --> 03:04:45.540
Capstone Coach 1: looks like that's scribbled across the screen.

1292
03:05:00.510 --> 03:05:06.810
Capstone Coach 1: This last program was just a little bit too complicated to just try to do it off of memory.

1293
03:05:25.980 --> 03:05:26.190
Capstone Coach 1: Is.

1294
03:05:27.750 --> 03:05:29.610
Capstone Coach 1: Your time series analysis.

1295
03:05:34.680 --> 03:05:35.460
Capstone Coach 1: nlp.

1296
03:05:41.940 --> 03:05:42.360
Capstone Coach 1: Very go.

1297
03:05:43.440 --> 03:05:48.180
Capstone Coach 1: So it's now in the week 12 folder and you should see it right at the bottom right now.

1298
03:05:49.500 --> 03:05:50.580
Capstone Coach 1: So if you could.

1299
03:05:52.500 --> 03:05:58.530
Capstone Coach 1: Just download and if you're still with me download it open that up and and.

1300
03:06:08.850 --> 03:06:10.200
Capstone Coach 1: yeah, this is it right here.

1301
03:06:11.430 --> 03:06:16.830
Capstone Coach 1: So this is the one if I run it see what happens.

1302
03:06:24.630 --> 03:06:26.370
Capstone Coach 1: Alright, so you can see how it's.

1303
03:06:28.110 --> 03:06:30.030
Capstone Coach 1: kind of strange looking right here.

1304
03:06:34.110 --> 03:06:49.110
Capstone Coach 1: What we can do is, we can change the number of perception, so the first layer from 20 let's drop it down to 10 and we'll make the instead of four maybe five i'll see if that helps us a little bit.

1305
03:06:54.180 --> 03:06:56.460
Capstone Coach 1: nope pretty much same right.

1306
03:06:58.110 --> 03:06:59.070
Capstone Coach 1: So.

1307
03:07:24.450 --> 03:07:24.660
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

1308
03:07:30.720 --> 03:07:36.930
Capstone Coach 1: let's check the column sizes on X shape yep why that ship.

1309
03:07:40.050 --> 03:07:42.030
Capstone Coach 1: Okay looks good.

1310
03:07:49.380 --> 03:07:51.150
Capstone Coach 1: On that looks great.

1311
03:07:52.620 --> 03:07:53.250
Capstone Coach 1: Instead of.

1312
03:07:59.940 --> 03:08:03.420
Capstone Coach 1: wonder if we dropped size to say for now.

1313
03:08:04.470 --> 03:08:08.550
Capstone Coach 1: I was using eight it's it's gotta be so let's try out.

1314
03:08:09.720 --> 03:08:10.260
Capstone Coach 1: Oh yeah.

1315
03:08:11.550 --> 03:08:12.150
Capstone Coach 1: That.

1316
03:08:13.920 --> 03:08:19.080
Capstone Coach 1: So the actual size, the batch size, I dropped it down to four instead of eight.

1317
03:08:20.190 --> 03:08:34.740
Capstone Coach 1: And you can see that the it actually increases right, the amount of calculations, is doing to converge get the network to converge and you can see, this turning out a little better, so if I go back then to the.

1318
03:08:37.170 --> 03:08:43.980
Capstone Coach 1: The network here and make this a 20 instead of a 10.

1319
03:08:47.580 --> 03:08:49.020
Capstone Coach 1: see what happens then.

1320
03:08:51.450 --> 03:08:53.280
Capstone Coach 1: should get a better response.

1321
03:08:55.860 --> 03:08:57.510
Capstone Coach 1: yeah little better.

1322
03:09:01.980 --> 03:09:07.410
Capstone Coach 1: If I change the number of the box from 22 let's say 50.

1323
03:09:08.880 --> 03:09:09.540
Capstone Coach 1: think that.

1324
03:09:10.920 --> 03:09:16.530
Capstone Coach 1: should also improve the convergence of a of a neural network estimates and.

1325
03:09:17.880 --> 03:09:19.590
Capstone Coach 1: So you see the loss is actually.

1326
03:09:19.680 --> 03:09:21.780
Capstone Coach 1: getting a little bit smaller.

1327
03:09:23.430 --> 03:09:23.970
Capstone Coach 1: There we go.

1328
03:09:25.170 --> 03:09:35.790
Capstone Coach 1: And right now the square root of the loss is one which means that the forecasts or on average is a plus or minus.

1329
03:09:36.960 --> 03:09:49.890
Capstone Coach 1: Two $2 off of the price which at you know $130 around the $33 it's not bad, this is better than the the arena, where we have 18.

1330
03:09:50.790 --> 03:10:04.440
Capstone Coach 1: plus or minus four or five of the on the forecast so we're getting a better price basically better forecasts here that we did with the the remote to model and we looked at.

1331
03:10:06.090 --> 03:10:20.280
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so i'll leave it leave this with you, and you can try experiment with, I think, with some of the settings and see what happens when you change those settings and how sensitive this is like the number of preceptor on, so the type of.

1332
03:10:21.810 --> 03:10:33.780
Capstone Coach 1: optimizer you're using right now, and that was done with using the atom and if I should go back to add a delta and change this to let's say a one instead of a tues lot to two different.

1333
03:10:35.850 --> 03:10:38.580
Capstone Coach 1: you'll see forecast changes.

1334
03:10:42.390 --> 03:10:44.610
Capstone Coach 1: The last system is still low.

1335
03:10:45.690 --> 03:10:46.320
Capstone Coach 1: But.

1336
03:10:48.060 --> 03:10:57.300
Capstone Coach 1: yeah it's just standard delta that this setting is doing Okay, but it's not doing as well as the Adam optimizer was.

1337
03:10:58.410 --> 03:11:03.690
Capstone Coach 1: Okay well thanks for your patience and thanks for waiting around and.

1338
03:11:05.430 --> 03:11:13.110
Capstone Coach 1: we'll be in touch on I was just basically post an optional homework for this week that's involves basically taking this.

1339
03:11:13.560 --> 03:11:26.370
Capstone Coach 1: optimizer taking this code rather and finding the best settings to reduce the you get the best forecast and in the output, you see it says square ASC or the square root of ASC.

1340
03:11:27.060 --> 03:11:40.290
Capstone Coach 1: What you want to do is to minimize these as much as you can, and you can do that by justin the optimizer you can adjust the activation from tension H to sigmoid or something like that.

1341
03:11:42.420 --> 03:11:43.020
Capstone Coach 1: The.

1342
03:11:44.760 --> 03:11:45.390
Capstone Coach 1: See.

1343
03:11:47.100 --> 03:11:53.100
Capstone Coach 1: Also, the number of the box or the size here if there was just those a little bit you can get different results.

1344
03:11:55.200 --> 03:11:57.960
Capstone Coach 1: That should do it okay we're good.

1345
03:11:58.980 --> 03:12:01.320
Capstone Coach 1: All right, well thanks for thanks for your patience.

1346
03:12:01.770 --> 03:12:02.640
Wilson Pineda: Thank you, Professor.

1347
03:12:04.590 --> 03:12:11.370
Capstone Coach 1: you're gonna have a good weekend good luck on your capstone those of you that are still coming up, I know this one tomorrow.

1348
03:12:11.940 --> 03:12:12.960
Capstone Coach 1: Thank you say that.

1349
03:12:13.080 --> 03:12:13.800
Purkiss, David: By by.

1350
03:12:14.250 --> 03:12:15.810
Wright, Beth: Dr Jones and I asked you.

1351
03:12:15.900 --> 03:12:17.700
Purkiss, David: For help on an error.

1352
03:12:18.600 --> 03:12:20.310
Capstone Coach 1: yeah sure this is a.

1353
03:12:20.610 --> 03:12:22.020
Purkiss, David: David yeah.

1354
03:12:22.470 --> 03:12:30.930
Purkiss, David: Sure, so i'm getting an error for my code it's like 93 as equals he history underscore difc.

1355
03:12:32.070 --> 03:12:35.400
Purkiss, David: per nmc epochs minus one.

1356
03:12:36.180 --> 03:12:39.720
Purkiss, David: Okay, no that's wrong say you say it's line number.

1357
03:12:39.810 --> 03:12:42.750
Purkiss, David: 93 or for you it's 97.

1358
03:12:43.200 --> 03:12:43.890
Capstone Coach 1: Oh okay.

1359
03:12:45.180 --> 03:12:46.770
Capstone Coach 1: This guy right here.

1360
03:12:47.370 --> 03:12:49.710
Capstone Coach 1: Yes, so what is the error saying.

1361
03:12:50.850 --> 03:12:54.750
Purkiss, David: It just says he error.

1362
03:12:55.980 --> 03:12:56.670
Purkiss, David: A.

1363
03:12:57.810 --> 03:12:59.220
Purkiss, David: Quote msc Unquote.

1364
03:13:01.200 --> 03:13:07.560
Capstone Coach 1: Okay up here up here we're on line number 89 there's, a thing that says metrics is equal to.

1365
03:13:08.730 --> 03:13:12.330
Purkiss, David: Missing that okay model compile.

1366
03:13:13.260 --> 03:13:19.410
Capstone Coach 1: A model mama compile let me highlight it right here and make it larger.

1367
03:13:19.770 --> 03:13:22.200
Capstone Coach 1: Years she little better see that.

1368
03:13:22.950 --> 03:13:28.710
Purkiss, David: optimizer equals op it comma metrics equals.

1369
03:13:30.300 --> 03:13:30.900
Capstone Coach 1: MC.

1370
03:13:31.350 --> 03:13:32.250
Purkiss, David: It looks right.

1371
03:13:34.200 --> 03:13:34.950
Capstone Coach 1: You have that.

1372
03:13:35.340 --> 03:13:39.630
Capstone Coach 1: Yes, and you got you got close open and close parenthesis here right.

1373
03:13:39.630 --> 03:13:41.730
Purkiss, David: Yes, yep model.

1374
03:13:42.240 --> 03:13:42.750
and

1375
03:13:44.100 --> 03:13:50.970
Capstone Coach 1: And the optimizer result PT which which optimizer do you have turned on at a delta or Adam.

1376
03:13:51.060 --> 03:13:51.930
Purkiss, David: I have Adam.

1377
03:13:52.650 --> 03:13:53.460
Capstone Coach 1: that's okay.

1378
03:13:54.780 --> 03:14:06.450
Capstone Coach 1: and your your thing there is what this is showing Adam right here, yes yeah something like that, and so the line that you're getting pinched on is right here.

1379
03:14:06.450 --> 03:14:07.980
Purkiss, David: right there, yes.

1380
03:14:08.220 --> 03:14:08.670
Capstone Coach 1: That one.

1381
03:14:09.330 --> 03:14:13.890
Capstone Coach 1: Yes, okay check the two lines above that.

1382
03:14:14.460 --> 03:14:17.250
Purkiss, David: Oh OK OK, I see one problem.

1383
03:14:17.850 --> 03:14:21.420
Purkiss, David: And IDA does that say as see.

1384
03:14:22.230 --> 03:14:24.600
Capstone Coach 1: Yes, right and here and here.

1385
03:14:25.140 --> 03:14:27.120
Purkiss, David: Now the green.

1386
03:14:27.510 --> 03:14:30.570
Capstone Coach 1: Or the Green is a the afc but.

1387
03:14:30.780 --> 03:14:33.780
Capstone Coach 1: Knowledge, but it shouldn't be a problem, whatever version.

1388
03:14:33.780 --> 03:14:35.100
Capstone Coach 1: there's going to get in front of it out.

1389
03:14:35.100 --> 03:14:36.210
Purkiss, David: Right yeah.

1390
03:14:38.340 --> 03:14:41.430
Purkiss, David: What the problem is is equals history underscore.

1391
03:14:42.180 --> 03:14:44.100
Capstone Coach 1: Did you download that file and.

1392
03:14:46.740 --> 03:14:49.200
Purkiss, David: Oh, I have the data yes and.

1393
03:14:49.440 --> 03:14:52.530
Capstone Coach 1: No, no, no, not the data, the actual code I upload.

1394
03:14:52.530 --> 03:14:53.700
Capstone Coach 1: Yes, code yeah.

1395
03:14:54.810 --> 03:14:58.560
Purkiss, David: All the new one, no I didn't I didn't download i'll do that i'll.

1396
03:14:59.640 --> 03:15:02.460
Capstone Coach 1: Probably probably something goofy like a missing comma.

1397
03:15:02.760 --> 03:15:04.740
Purkiss, David: yeah i've got something in there.

1398
03:15:05.070 --> 03:15:08.010
Capstone Coach 1: OK missing the comma, you can kill the whole thing.

1399
03:15:08.130 --> 03:15:12.990
Purkiss, David: yeah it's either calm or okay i'll figure it out, thank you.

1400
03:15:13.230 --> 03:15:15.120
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, David Thank you.

1401
03:15:15.720 --> 03:15:16.380
Purkiss, David: You too bye.

1402
03:15:16.800 --> 03:15:17.250
bye bye.
