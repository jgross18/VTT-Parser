1
00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:03.659
Jones, Edward R: there's the parking lot is still full 11 o'clock at night I.

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.420
Jordan Gross: will say the one on the apple campus.

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:17.940
Jordan Gross: A little bit better than again I did come in right when a pandemic was getting underway, so I don't know if that affected the parking situation i'm going to assume it had some kind of impact live right across.

4
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.340
Jordan Gross: And it's.

5
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.120
Jones, Edward R: The underlying.

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.950
Jordan Gross: message different work ethic i'm told.

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.390
Jones, Edward R: yeah the underlying.

8
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.740
Jordan Gross: Live is very different from.

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.500
Jordan Gross: The Austin by by people who have worked between the two.

10
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:36.450
Jones, Edward R: Okay yeah the people there in cupertino the word was so if you go to work for apple you're gonna have to work a lot hours.

11
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.920
Jordan Gross: May I certainly do that but I never feel burnt out so hopefully I figured it out some kind of balance.

12
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:53.310
Jones, Edward R: Okay well let's go ahead and get started and i'm on my little little micro computer right here little really thing yeah.

13
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.860
Jones, Edward R: where's the camera.

14
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.510
Jones, Edward R: you're using the camera on my only thing here.

15
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.920
Jones, Edward R: let's actually pretty cool i'm glad I got a mask on.

16
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.850
David Purkiss: yeah we're seeing both angles.

17
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:23.610
Jones, Edward R: Dr Jones okay oh mask helps keep you from going getting yeah i'm not very photogenic so okay and tonight, before I came here, I was shaving in the shower and cut myself.

18
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:43.230
Jones, Edward R: In the lip, no, no less so i'm glad to get the mask on whatever here, Jim is here Karen is here you glad to see you here, Jordan, of courses out of Boston good to see him here, so all right let's go ahead and get started.

19
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.050
Jones, Edward R: If you would go to eat campus.

20
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.100
Jones, Edward R: So i'm going to going to.

21
00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:07.860
Jones, Edward R: Open up the campus here and see what I can do about it, so if we go to eat campus you're going to see a bunch of stuff I had been i've been having a lot of fun preparing for this this particular lecture and you're going to see why here in just a minute.

22
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.650
Jones, Edward R: Okay, send me a foolish man, yes, yes, yes.

23
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.310
Jones, Edward R: It says, I don't care, but has an Internet connection.

24
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.420
Jones, Edward R: Now there it is it's.

25
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.000
Jones, Edward R: Asked code.

26
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.880
Jones, Edward R: cancel enter Code and the code is.

27
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.640
Jones, Edward R: They want to be so careful about me logging in.

28
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:58.770
Jones, Edward R: I have, I have dangerous access to personal information Okay, so this is what our e campus site looks like tonight and tonight we are on week four, but I wanted to mention that, if you go to week three.

29
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.630
And if you look at the week.

30
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.120
Karen Fireman: it's Karen I can't see your screen i'm sorry and also do you have this slides uploaded because I couldn't find the neither.

31
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.700
Jones, Edward R: Well i'll show you i'll show you just.

32
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.080
Karen Fireman: can't see your screen.

33
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.010
I can.

34
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.380
Jones, Edward R: Nobody can see my screen.

35
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.820
Karen Fireman: I don't know I can't.

36
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.820
Jones, Edward R: No, no, no, I can share the screen.

37
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.260
Jones, Edward R: You won't know sure.

38
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.480
David Purkiss: We cannot see it, we cannot see it.

39
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.550
Karen Fireman: We see you, but no screen.

40
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.060
Karen Fireman: Okay well you're good to see.

41
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.160
Jones, Edward R: You would rather see the screen I know.

42
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.090
David Purkiss: I know yeah we have.

43
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.880
David Purkiss: We have a little too much of seeing you right now.

44
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:42.180
Jones, Edward R: that's what i'm thinking too much okay hang on where is the little thing that says share.

45
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:58.740
Jones, Edward R: I don't see the thing that says share, you have to go back to your zoom I have to, I have to go to St yeah, of course, and then the little green oh there we go share mm hmm and I guess that's don't know.

46
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.540
Jones, Edward R: i'm just going to share this stuff I guess share.

47
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.350
Jones, Edward R: Oh okay good i'm gone my pictures coming great okay so.

48
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:23.910
Jones, Edward R: let's see if we can get get to your questions here about the word is everything okay here in week number three if you go to the week three assignment.

49
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.030
Jones, Edward R: You should see at the very bottom is the solution code that i'm.

50
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:37.530
Jones, Edward R: populating here for week three and we'll talk about that here, in just a minute.

51
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.170
Jones, Edward R: Then, if you go to week four.

52
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:56.730
Jones, Edward R: right here you'll see but it's hidden no wonder, make available, please Okay, there you go, so the week for lecture notes are now in visible, they are now visible and the week for folder.

53
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.300
Jones, Edward R: And in addition to the lecture notes that we have here, these are quite large, by the way, and you'll see why.

54
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:11.670
Jones, Edward R: In addition to the lecture notes, we have the files that are going to be used during this likes to lectures tonight.

55
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:22.080
Jones, Edward R: And then there's another one called week for assignment and it's at the bottom, let me show you give you a preview of what the week for Simon about this is, if you open this up.

56
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:33.090
Jones, Edward R: This is you, in this case, you do not get a template you get a picture of an APP and then you're asked to build the code for that particular APP.

57
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:44.040
Jones, Edward R: Now what this APP does is you type in something here in English you select a language like Chinese or German and then you click on the button that says speak.

58
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:58.980
Jones, Edward R: And it translates it and displays the translation in the text box and at the computer talks to you and speaks and pronounces translation to you in Chinese.

59
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:14.340
Jones, Edward R: Is that cool Okay, I think it's way cool tonight we're talking about audio speaking, how to take audio recordings of somebody's talking and turn it into text.

60
00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.590
Jones, Edward R: And, of course, if that text is in Chinese we know how to translate right.

61
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:25.740
Jones, Edward R: Then you will also learn how to take text and turn it into a recording.

62
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:37.770
Jones, Edward R: So that's the trick in this case, we first translate in Chinese and then the computer is going to take that trance Chinese translation and speak Chinese.

63
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:49.740
Jones, Edward R: it'll basically say the equivalent of Hello Howard you speak English, you know in Chinese and and i've checked this with languages that I know I do not know Chinese.

64
00:06:50.670 --> 00:07:04.950
Jones, Edward R: Spanish, German and it's very, very good and you have already learned a lot of the tricks when you use the API to do the translation you learned a lot about credentials, for example.

65
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:17.940
Jones, Edward R: And that technique that you use to validate the software you'll use that tonight when we look at translating speech recorded speech to text and vice versa.

66
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:29.340
Jones, Edward R: The technology here is is amazing to me because I studied this and looked at this some years ago decades ago, and this was like impossible to do.

67
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:40.770
Jones, Edward R: But decades to go, but now they have some tricks and they're actually using neural networks they're using new neural networks that are pre trained.

68
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:58.560
Jones, Edward R: To do the translations and also to analyze voice communications and turn those miscommunications into readable information so that's what we're that's what we're up to tonight, let me go back to the week for folder and i'm going to open up the the lecture notes here.

69
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.880
Jones, Edward R: And it's coming down and all right.

70
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:04.530
Jones, Edward R: and

71
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.260
Karen Fireman: i'm sorry where did you say the answers for the homework are I know you said server administration, sir.

72
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.610
Jones, Edward R: Well, the answer to the homework is going to be in the in the presentation.

73
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:16.350
Karen Fireman: Oh okay.

74
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:21.720
Jones, Edward R: The code for the homework is in the week three assignment folder three Okay, thank you yeah.

75
00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:35.340
Jones, Edward R: i'm which basically sounds right so Okay, this is now something else that you that you probably should just go ahead and do.

76
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:50.010
Jones, Edward R: And let's get started with that and what i'm talking about is anaconda and spider So if you would in addition to downloading the presentation and cranking it up start up anaconda for me.

77
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.840
Jones, Edward R: And the reason for the you know how this thing takes a while right.

78
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:08.850
Jones, Edward R: and eventually we're going to be what we're going to be doing in the lecture tonight is we'll be doing a lot of try this try that will you're going to look at some code and you're going to try the code on your computer make sure, everything is running and that sort of thing.

79
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:12.030
Jones, Edward R: So.

80
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:12.810
David Purkiss: I got.

81
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.150
Jones, Edward R: David yes.

82
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:25.380
David Purkiss: Yes, I was wondering if you're going to go over the the homework for week three and whether or not you had a file for us.

83
00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:27.630
Jones, Edward R: Even if you just come in.

84
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:29.400
David Purkiss: No.

85
00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.630
Karen Fireman: No he's right, I only see week two under the week three folder I use right.

86
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:40.590
Jones, Edward R: there's the, the answer is the answer, oh baby there you go to.

87
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.370
David Purkiss: Malaysia for just a quick minute, but I might.

88
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:54.900
Jones, Edward R: As well do that man, and I was trying to say the Code, the code solution for the week three assignment is in the week three assignment folder.

89
00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.420
Jones, Edward R: and its designated hw translate P, why okay.

90
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.620
David Purkiss: Sorry now.

91
00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.910
Jones, Edward R: The presentation that we're going to be looking at here has the solution also in it.

92
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:14.820
Jones, Edward R: So you're going to see to version two different discussions of it here tonight Okay, so if you get to anaconda open I just got it open here.

93
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:32.280
Jones, Edward R: change from the base environment change to the environment that you're using for translate in on this computer the end by using the term Google for that environment you notice i've got one there for 656 and for drone that'll be coming up pretty soon.

94
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:40.860
Jones, Edward R: But tonight we're talking about how to talk to the computer, how does siri really work is it any good.

95
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:47.790
Jones, Edward R: And I know many of us here tonight, if you had a conversation if you had a recorded conversation.

96
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.460
Jones, Edward R: of somebody doing something.

97
00:10:51.570 --> 00:11:05.880
Jones, Edward R: And let's say that conversation was in Chinese Okay, you should be able to use your computer to decipher what's being said and to translate it into English and produce an English translation of that pretty quickly.

98
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:18.600
Jones, Edward R: Of course, if you've got a lot of noise in there yeah that's that's if you have a decent recording right so maybe a telephone call or something like that maybe it would work them okay.

99
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:27.510
Jones, Edward R: let's see no remind me later I don't need to be okay so i'm now in my my thing there and then i'm going to open up spider.

100
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:48.300
Jones, Edward R: So i've got my the environment selected here, this is the environment that you have been using for translate and I hit launch and so spider is going to come up, we will be installing some small packages tonight and that's why that's why I kind of wanted you to get this going.

101
00:11:50.220 --> 00:12:00.420
Jones, Edward R: You already should have the cloud translate installed and you probably have the Google ot a T h.

102
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:04.050
Jones, Edward R: Instead, running and so i'm going to.

103
00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.590
Jones, Edward R: make this a little bit larger well.

104
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:18.600
Jones, Edward R: That was totally public noise windows okay there we go make the code, a little bit larger, you should have the Google au Th.

105
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:26.610
Jones, Edward R: already running on in your environment and you're going to put we're probably going to install two new.

106
00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:36.090
Jones, Edward R: Google cloud packages tonight, or one that translates speech to text and then another one that takes text and turns it into speech.

107
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:44.700
Jones, Edward R: And then another one, I think you probably have it as good as Google cloud storage, I think you have that but we'll see.

108
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:59.850
Jones, Edward R: But that's getting the head of things let's go back to the presentation here and i'm going to sort of minimize anaconda here and minimize this please download our tools message I hate that Google apple is trying to sell me something again.

109
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:06.690
Jones, Edward R: So let's go to slide show and i'm going to start with the started the front right.

110
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.620
Jones, Edward R: Start okay further we go to frank frank right right right.

111
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:27.000
Jones, Edward R: Okay, now I need to minimize see I only have one screen here, are you guys able Okay, so it looks like you're okay with this right Okay, so far, so good so we're on February, the night yay.

112
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.790
Jones, Edward R: In about a month, by the way, March, the second is coming up.

113
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:46.620
Jones, Edward R: March, the second turns out to be Texas Independence Day and the governor has decided that everybody gets off on Texas on Texas Independence Day, which means no class on March, the second Tuesday.

114
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:56.190
Jones, Edward R: So you're going to go, I have like a two week period where we're not going to be talking well we'll be talking on homework and things like that or Q amp a but.

115
00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:06.900
Jones, Edward R: Otherwise, not okay so here's the here's where we're doing tonight, this has got it we got a we got a full presentation here for different five different parts.

116
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:16.170
Jones, Edward R: Number one we're going to talk about the solution to week three number two we're going to talk about creating your own cloud credentials okay i'm sorry.

117
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:23.580
Jones, Edward R: i'm sorry I turn this loose on you and many of you were able to handle it you got your credentials and it's working.

118
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:34.710
Jones, Edward R: But, but we have a few that we have quite a few actually that it's not working for them, and so what I did was I put together a step by step by step.

119
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:49.950
Jones, Edward R: description of what you need to do in order to set up your credentials and other things so by now, I hope you have wiggled your way around the cloud Google cloud, and all of that business.

120
00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:59.730
Jones, Edward R: tonight will be taking a closer look at that, so I can describe for you the other parts, you know you walked in you use the translation part of the cloud.

121
00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:09.810
Jones, Edward R: Man there's like 300 or over 300 different api's in the Google cloud and a lot of them are kind of interesting we're going to be looking at two new ones tonight.

122
00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:20.160
Jones, Edward R: One, will you look at the first one we're going to look at Part Three out of take text and convert it into speech, how to get your computer to talk.

123
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:38.400
Jones, Edward R: And, and we and, by the way this is language independent I mean obviously people have done some of this for English for some time, but we can take let's say a Chinese text and and get the computer to produce a recording of that text.

124
00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:48.420
Jones, Edward R: As well as English and Spanish and other languages part four we're going to do the inverse take a recording and turn it into text.

125
00:15:49.350 --> 00:16:02.310
Jones, Edward R: And of course the translation of going from one language to another language, we know how to do that, and so this is very cool we can take a recording that's in one language.

126
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:12.450
Jones, Edward R: We can translate it into English and then we can have the computer read that the English translation, or you can take a English text.

127
00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:23.640
Jones, Edward R: turn it into Spanish and then have the computer read that if you want to Okay, and in fact your homework for this week is like that.

128
00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:33.000
Jones, Edward R: So that's number four and the last thing is the assignment that you've already seen there something online and week number four for the that describes what the assignment is.

129
00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:51.930
Jones, Edward R: The description is pretty simple pretty easy and after tonight I hope it's fairly easy to see how to do that okay so first of all, the week three assignment, which is about translation translate translation APP So this is the the the template that you were given.

130
00:16:52.950 --> 00:17:08.700
Jones, Edward R: And you see here that it basically we're going to take text files of Spanish Chinese or German and then we're going to translate them into other other languages so.

131
00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:17.250
Jones, Edward R: These buttons don't all work the website button is not working, the audio button well after some mind you'll be able to program that one.

132
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:25.980
Jones, Edward R: But it right now it's not working so in the template there is a text file button you click on it and then you'll be able to browse to a text file.

133
00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:33.690
Jones, Edward R: Open that text file and then it will translate it automatically to whatever language is clicked on the right hand side.

134
00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:51.480
Jones, Edward R: And then you'll be able to take that translation and save it by clicking on the far right hand button, so what you needed to do in this assignment is to add four different languages trap, the Japanese Korean Farsi I think it is and one other.

135
00:17:53.100 --> 00:18:04.590
Jones, Edward R: and get that basically extend the list of languages here by about four, and this, by the way, is a list that's being built here by.

136
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:07.050
Jones, Edward R: Radio buttons.

137
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:13.590
Jones, Edward R: What I can't hear what you're saying.

138
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:17.700
Karen Fireman: i'm sorry.

139
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.140
Jones, Edward R: Will you talking to us.

140
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.220
Karen Fireman: Now i'm sorry.

141
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.210
Okay.

142
00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.490
Jones, Edward R: Okay, something about the gym or something I don't know alright.

143
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:42.750
Jones, Edward R: So, in order to for this assignment really all you need to do is add four languages to this list, and then get the SAVE button to work, I think this that's all you need to do everything else is working here if you type something in the upper.

144
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:54.120
Jones, Edward R: line and you hit translate then you'll get a translation Okay, so the first step, of course, is to download this and open it up and spider.

145
00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:55.860
Jones, Edward R: and

146
00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:21.330
Jones, Edward R: There we go and yeah I just tested it here, using the asking it translate a simple phrase like, how do you speak at this hello, do you speak English and they translate and then also I tried to just open up this other file it's a Chinese file 359 characters and see you see how that worked.

147
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:32.310
Jones, Edward R: So what do you need to do what I did was I extended the the the gooey by adding the textbook on box on the bottom and so you'll see there's a.

148
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:42.120
Jones, Edward R: maroon colored text box that's been placed down here, and the reason I did that was that if you hit translate you do see the translation show up in your eye window.

149
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:52.890
Jones, Edward R: But I thought, well, it would be cool if it also showed up here on your screen, so I added this text box and now the translation will show up in both on your in your I.

150
00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:04.050
Jones, Edward R: console and also on there you're going the bottom part of this, that you see right here and here's the code that's doing this, so.

151
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:06.030
Karen Fireman: first chance, can I see.

152
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.740
Jones, Edward R: What Karen.

153
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.760
Karen Fireman: it's Karen i'm not sure I see the file we're supposed to download here.

154
00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:13.920
Karen Fireman: pull into.

155
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.560
Jones, Edward R: What are you talking about the the week three homework file.

156
00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:20.400
Karen Fireman: know the one that you're talking about now aren't we supposed to for filing.

157
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.180
Jones, Edward R: In week four folder the very first file.

158
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.670
Jones, Edward R: Is the prison is this PowerPoint file.

159
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.910
Karen Fireman: Okay, but we're not supposed to download a file for.

160
00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:33.540
Karen Fireman: This okay.

161
00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:42.180
Jones, Edward R: The the file the code that you're seeing is the week three solution.

162
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.590
Karen Fireman: Oh OK that's it was.

163
00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.240
Jones, Edward R: Like Oh, if you wanted, if you.

164
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:49.110
Jones, Edward R: wanted them you don't need to download it, but if you wanted to download it.

165
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:50.220
Jones, Edward R: for free.

166
00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:51.960
Karen Fireman: yeah Thank you i'm sorry.

167
00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:52.800
Jones, Edward R: No problem.

168
00:20:53.490 --> 00:21:00.600
Jones, Edward R: So this is this is showing you how the add those for new languages and Japanese Korean Vietnamese and in Latin.

169
00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:13.230
Jones, Edward R: Always firstly okay Japanese Korean Vietnamese and Latin I think of for noon languages and so basically all you need to do around line number 900 and 191 is the line number here.

170
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:25.350
Jones, Edward R: Is you need to add for new check buttons and you're there already like 10 of them so you're adding check button 1112 1314.

171
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:45.570
Jones, Edward R: The you also needed to extend the language description in there's a list of languages and then also the the coding for those languages che for Japanese scale for Korean and so forth, and so on, so these needed to be expanded and then you needed to add those little check buttons.

172
00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:58.860
Jones, Edward R: And then you also needed to add a little function when they're checked when they're clicked on you want to go to this language 11 1213 and 14.

173
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:08.670
Jones, Edward R: and the first thing you do is clear, all the buttons and then you set that particular button like 13 in this case and then your target is equal to.

174
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.380
Jones, Edward R: The.

175
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:20.910
Jones, Edward R: Whatever was selected so for example here language 11 the target is going to be Japanese right so.

176
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:29.340
Jones, Edward R: that's what that last line isn't that function and then of course the the the function that clears all the buttons here LNG clear.

177
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:46.200
Jones, Edward R: You want to add those four new languages to the bottom of it, so all we're doing here is adding for new radio buttons are click buttons and then we add for the functions and everything that are associated with those new buttons.

178
00:22:50.190 --> 00:23:02.370
Jones, Edward R: The other thing that have to do in this assignment, in addition to adding the So if you run it right now, if you have to add those those make those changes and run it, you will see the four new buttons show up will be here on the right hand side.

179
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:11.640
Jones, Edward R: Now, once you get this far, then you also need to activate the SAVE button and while we're doing here is saving the translation.

180
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:18.540
Jones, Edward R: To a text file and there is a function for that about created here and what's what I handled it.

181
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:34.170
Jones, Edward R: Number one what you have to do make sure of is the the button for save and then this is the button for save you have command is equal to the name of the function that's met that performs this so right now it's called save translation.

182
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.580
Jones, Edward R: And you can see what i'm doing here I create a new gui.

183
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:51.420
Jones, Edward R: And then, what happens is you, you make the source file he set up the dialogue that basically it's going to ask the user, where do you want to put this file.

184
00:23:51.930 --> 00:24:05.730
Jones, Edward R: And what name, do you want to give to it and that's, this is the code that is used to basically go through that dialogue it's called anti kenter it's called a file dialog ask save as file name.

185
00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:16.500
Jones, Edward R: that's the function that's being used here, and this function is very, very handy because anytime you want somebody to give you a name for a file and then save it.

186
00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:37.800
Jones, Edward R: This is the file dialog that I think most people would turn to there are other ways to do this, but this seems to be pretty bulletproof and so, then you you basically get the name from them using the the file dialog method and tea counter and then you destroy that window.

187
00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:47.580
Jones, Edward R: To get rid of it, and then you basically open the source file create for writing you're opening a new file for writing.

188
00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:56.820
Jones, Edward R: And then you write the translation and the translation is stored in a object called self dot translation that's just a long string.

189
00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:12.030
Jones, Edward R: This is a text file, so what you're writing as a very long string that includes things like punctuation and you know paragraph terminators and things like that, and then you print out onto the console.

190
00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:26.070
Jones, Edward R: The file save so they know then okay we're done, you were able to save the translation to a file and you close the file so that's all there is to basically asking the person to.

191
00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:33.750
Jones, Edward R: give you a file name and then saving that by writing that file out so this particular function would be very useful in many, many.

192
00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:43.530
Jones, Edward R: Apps you might, for example, if you wanted to save a recording a speech recording now, this is a text file text file is a big string.

193
00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:51.270
Jones, Edward R: Tonight we're going to be looking at speech files recordings and those are going to be binary yeah they're not.

194
00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:58.410
Jones, Edward R: You can't open them up and look at them and see if you did I mean you can open them up and look at them what you're going to see a bunch of numbers.

195
00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:05.430
Jones, Edward R: Which is representing the the audio the speech that is in that file so that file.

196
00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:16.890
Jones, Edward R: Would we would be binary and so you would if you're going to write that file, instead of just saying w here, you would say w be bravo for binary.

197
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:25.650
Jones, Edward R: And so, this particular method that we're looking at can be used not just to write text files, but you're right other types of documents and files.

198
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:38.100
Jones, Edward R: That would be let's say in a particular file format, and for that we would use binary web if you're going to read that in a file and instead of saying our you'd say rb for read binary.

199
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:45.570
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so so then here's an example where.

200
00:26:46.230 --> 00:27:00.720
Jones, Edward R: Basically, if you say hello, do you speak English and hit translate, and this is click this German that you get the German translation for that particular sentence and yeah good is this a sit down yes.

201
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.270
Gupta, Satyam: If you could go back to the.

202
00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:08.130
Gupta, Satyam: Previous slide I had a question on the code, which was ever that file dialog.

203
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.440
Jones, Edward R: This one right here, yes.

204
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.240
Gupta, Satyam: Can you explain it.

205
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.190
Gupta, Satyam: Really quickly like what are these.

206
00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:21.330
Gupta, Satyam: Other other line of code doing like di quantify when dot left and when dot focus.

207
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.610
Jones, Edward R: yeah yeah this is.

208
00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.470
Gupta, Satyam: A little mystery for me.

209
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:27.180
Jones, Edward R: yeah.

210
00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:31.050
Jones, Edward R: Well, you know what the first even know what the first line is doing right yep.

211
00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:36.180
Jones, Edward R: it's basically just creating a teak a canvas.

212
00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:37.530
Gupta, Satyam: canvas yes.

213
00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.490
Jones, Edward R: yeah yeah.

214
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:39.810
Jones, Edward R: The others.

215
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:42.900
Jones, Edward R: I would have to look up the Code, the the.

216
00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:51.090
Jones, Edward R: definition of what they're doing I do know the quantify this has to do with somebody clicking on the little red button.

217
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:57.960
Jones, Edward R: If you click on a little red button the screen disappears right or the APP the disappears, I do know that.

218
00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:08.400
Jones, Edward R: And I know that the the form of focus for us is basically forcing this window to the front of your screen, so that you take notice of it right.

219
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:28.110
Jones, Edward R: But the geometry, obviously the geometry one is talking about how big to make this and but I don't fully understand how these things are all working together, I mean that's that's The big question, and so on occasion I saw some behavior that didn't look right.

220
00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:30.390
Jones, Edward R: So.

221
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:35.400
Jones, Edward R: This is still a work in progress, all I can say is right now it's working.

222
00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:41.790
Gupta, Satyam: yeah I mean yeah I mean some of it, I understand some of it not so that's why I was but.

223
00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:53.310
Jones, Edward R: yeah yeah well part of the part of the problem here, and this is a general problem for Python is you have packages that are not release you don't know they're not really supported who owns this package.

224
00:28:54.330 --> 00:29:01.890
Jones, Edward R: Does apple on this package does this Google know this is one of those freak three things and on in Python.

225
00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:17.010
Jones, Edward R: Well, somebody probably originated well, they have been rejected, but are they working who's working on it today, so they come up with a new version of Python and then somebody has to go back into this package and retool it.

226
00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:20.700
Jones, Edward R: who's going to do that, I mean you know so.

227
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:34.260
Jones, Edward R: I I ran i've run into some trouble packages, they were highly read it people talk about how good the packages and then you find out that was a year ago and today it and work.

228
00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:44.250
Jones, Edward R: Because, because that was version eight of Python and now we're 8.4 something like that so.

229
00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:57.840
Jones, Edward R: This is a continuing issue with a language like Python where you have met many much bb much of it is not really being maintained, except for the grace good graces of some volunteers.

230
00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:07.170
Jones, Edward R: Now there are parts of it that's, for example, the cyphy side library, that seems to be you know commercial.

231
00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:21.780
Jones, Edward R: I mean it's free, but they do get it, they do get a lot of money from advertising and things like that you know people using their package so Okay, so I know where you're coming from with that question, I have some of those questions myself.

232
00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.040
David Purkiss: Dr Jones I have another question, too, about the homework oh yes.

233
00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:26.700
Jones, Edward R: David yeah.

234
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:28.290
David Purkiss: So.

235
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:40.470
David Purkiss: This is saving whatever translate right, whether you translate from the entry a short text or if you translate from a text file correct.

236
00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:41.550
Jones, Edward R: That is correct.

237
00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:42.960
David Purkiss: And so.

238
00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:46.530
David Purkiss: Where is it where is it holding.

239
00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:52.920
David Purkiss: That data and how is that command retrieving the content of the translation.

240
00:30:52.950 --> 00:31:01.980
Jones, Edward R: I don't see that okay look it both of both of we would have to go back into the code, but what you're going to see in them when you hit the translate button on the top.

241
00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:06.690
Jones, Edward R: It calls a certain function, and it does the translation.

242
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:09.090
Jones, Edward R: And it stores, the translation in an.

243
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.290
Jones, Edward R: object called translation self that translation.

244
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:24.990
Jones, Edward R: Now, the same thing happens down here when you click on text file and it opens that file and reads it and does the translation it stores, the translation in the same object.

245
00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.720
Jones, Edward R: And since this thinking yeah.

246
00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:37.530
Jones, Edward R: And since but here's the here's the cool thing is this is David, this is really what because you got two different functions in two different places in your code, how does this happen.

247
00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:54.300
Jones, Edward R: they're sharing an object and that's why you have the self period translation everything with the self period in front of it is, it is a object or a variable that is seen and knowledgeable to all of the other functions within that class.

248
00:31:55.500 --> 00:32:10.530
Jones, Edward R: Now, in your regular part of your code, if you were to call translation or sell it would say what know that variable is not global it's not accessible to everyone except the code that's in the class the gooey.

249
00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:11.970
Jones, Edward R: yeah.

250
00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:13.770
Jones, Edward R: So yeah.

251
00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.360
David Purkiss: Take a look you very much yep.

252
00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:18.930
Jones, Edward R: yeah take a look at those two things you'll see with them i'm sure you will.

253
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.100
Jones, Edward R: make sense.

254
00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:20.730
yeah.

255
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:26.160
Jones, Edward R: that's a good question, but you know that's how it's done okay so.

256
00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:36.990
Jones, Edward R: How about this little box at the bottom, how was that done well it's done here is just showing yourself that T is equal to a text you just that's how you create the text box.

257
00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:58.440
Jones, Edward R: And then you like many things you give it a background color morone the foreground coders white so all the translation that shows up in there is going to be white anything that goes over the sentence is going to wrap word ramp you can there's a there's a fault here for aerial something.

258
00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:00.120
Jones, Edward R: and

259
00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:12.030
Jones, Edward R: Also, then I do a ti dot grid and giving it the location of this text box, as I wanted in the first column, I want to cover it both columns on the on the mainframe.

260
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:29.400
Jones, Edward R: frame and i'm going to just put it in wrote 10 so one of the issue, one of the gotchas here, by the way, for some reason, and I forget which student they might have been gupta not sure.

261
00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:40.830
Jones, Edward R: But it turns out that in most of these widgets these tk widgets you can, at the end of this description of where you want the widget to go.

262
00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:54.240
Jones, Edward R: You can go dot grid, and then the dot and then the grid function defines where this is going to be placed well if you do that, in the in the text widget it doesn't work.

263
00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:09.090
Jones, Edward R: And so, for the text widget and other widgets that are not tk the grid call needs to be a separate call and placed underneath right underneath the.

264
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:21.900
Jones, Edward R: The place where you actually defined that widget, so this is a tk widget not a TT K widget the buttons and everything we're tck, but this is a tk because there is no text box.

265
00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:36.480
Jones, Edward R: And the TT K tinker world in the Tiki a list of widgets there so anyway that's just that's something that really threw me off, unless i'm going on how many hours, I spent trying to figure out what.

266
00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.740
Jones, Edward R: And this is, and this is one of those things, by the way, where.

267
00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:50.040
Jones, Edward R: It one time it worked back in Python two day and Python three day no I didn't work and, by the way, there's no documentation on this.

268
00:34:50.970 --> 00:35:04.140
Jones, Edward R: No where did I find that in documentation or anybody saying hey don't don't put the grid that as part of the the text box self have it as a separate statement but that's the trick and getting this text box to work.

269
00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:08.400
Gupta, Satyam: me Dr Jones if that is correct.

270
00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.770
Jones, Edward R: What what is not correct.

271
00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:16.770
Gupta, Satyam: I mean, I think I have tried dod grid like on both tk tk.

272
00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:26.820
Gupta, Satyam: Yes, and they've worked it's just that you run into an issue if you are trying to retrieve anything from that widget which has dod grid you.

273
00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:31.890
Jones, Edward R: I could not we'll go back and look at this, but I could not get it to even show on the screen.

274
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:41.310
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so there was it was way beyond that it was like where is it in the air, I never showed up until I made them separate like.

275
00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:41.820
This.

276
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:56.040
Jones, Edward R: i'm sure, there must be some documentation that says if you're going to use a tk widget not a tck you need to do this, but it wasn't obvious from the documentation, I saw anyway.

277
00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:00.000
Jones, Edward R: If you want to delete and then insert the translations of.

278
00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:08.070
Jones, Edward R: This first statement delete delete from character one to the end of the of the text box, everything is there, it clears it out.

279
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:22.950
Jones, Edward R: clears out whatever is currently in the text box and then the second, the second statement dot insert basically take starts in character, place number one and runs all the way till the end of the translation.

280
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:32.880
Jones, Edward R: So very simple very really simple elegant way to put stuff into the box and to erase it is very easy.

281
00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:43.770
Jones, Edward R: This is this upper part right here's the tricky part it's not too tricky once you see it but trying to figure all that out, I had problems.

282
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.360
So.

283
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:50.100
Jones, Edward R: Thank you for helping and I think it was one of this.

284
00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:52.650
Jones, Edward R: position on here tonight.

285
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.310
Jones, Edward R: Oh, my yeah that's it.

286
00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:57.900
Jones, Edward R: applies here, are you doing blind.

287
00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:01.620
Jones, Edward R: You okay all right he's quite.

288
00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:02.940
Zuberi, Bilal Mustafa: doing well, Dr Jones.

289
00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:04.140
Okay.

290
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:11.820
Jones, Edward R: He knows what i'm going to say so, he just taken their courting alright so that's the text box and then.

291
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:15.510
Jones, Edward R: If you this is this is actually showing the.

292
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:24.330
Jones, Edward R: Whole cold of the language translate so at the end of the language translate code now, this is the code that translates the.

293
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:38.280
Jones, Edward R: Whatever is written in that top line you hit translate button and boom all you have to do is insert this at the bottom of that code and basically it says okay right the self translate thing into that little maroon box at the bottom.

294
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:49.440
Jones, Edward R: And that's it that's that was homework number three and the code is in the week three assignment folder okay.

295
00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:58.290
Jones, Edward R: If you have any questions on that, let me know we'll have a q&a as usual tomorrow night, and you can bring those up tomorrow and i'd be fine.

296
00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:10.620
Jones, Edward R: Okay, now, I have a bunch of stuff on credentials, how do you register in the cloud and how you find yourself around the cloud right.

297
00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:20.040
Jones, Edward R: Okay, now, you may already have your credentials credentials and they're working still I think you're going to find some useful information here about what else is in there, anyway.

298
00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:30.000
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so what you do I, in order to get these slides I had to create a new email.

299
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:38.100
Jones, Edward R: A gmail email right and so actually I had a spare gmail email it's called.

300
00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:49.020
Jones, Edward R: The it's called eat Jones no no yeah he Jones yeah he Jones at tm you stats services dot G gmail.

301
00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.000
Jones, Edward R: No, no, no, no.

302
00:38:53.040 --> 00:39:05.910
Jones, Edward R: These the team email is tam stats services that gmail.com so there's sort of generic sort of thing, and so I basically logged into this new gmail email for me.

303
00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:14.670
Jones, Edward R: And that allows me to them to show you what happens if you want to create your credentials from scratch what you would do is get a new email.

304
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:21.930
Jones, Edward R: And log into that and I advise you to get a Google email address talking gmail here.

305
00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:30.750
Jones, Edward R: And it didn't matter what that addresses, but you got a new address so they'll look at you, as a new customer Otherwise, what happens is.

306
00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:46.890
Jones, Edward R: Oh, we know who you are we got your credit card they won't even let it until you they they they won't they don't want you to do this okay so act like you don't know them and do that by creating the new gmail okay next.

307
00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:58.950
Jones, Edward R: You hit that little thing that says you're welcome welcome to our cloud, and then you type in gmail address right here there it is tam staff services at gmail COM.

308
00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:09.570
Jones, Edward R: Okay, that was a business thing so that's how the business, and so this should pop up unless you already logged into an account that they know.

309
00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:21.420
Jones, Edward R: That you've already been to the cloud and which which case they will show you this, but the first time you do this with a new gmail address and email, this is what they're going to show you.

310
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.740
Jones, Edward R: Then they'll say why hey welcome welcome.

311
00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:34.740
Jones, Edward R: Add your home address please and confirm your recovery email or phone number that's friendly enough, so I did that.

312
00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:55.230
Jones, Edward R: go through, and you give their home address, and you, you give them another email and I gave them the email that they know and they didn't and they didn't didn't get excited about that Okay, so I gave him the other email that I use for my other cloud thing, and that was okay done click.

313
00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:06.690
Jones, Edward R: And then, they say, well, you have to agree to our service, nobody ever reads this really so anyway, you have to click agree and then click continue.

314
00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:11.940
Jones, Edward R: And notice on the right hand side they're doing their marketing $300 credit for free.

315
00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:21.300
Jones, Edward R: yeah, this is a, this is a capitalist country and then Google is the title to make some money and that's what they're trying to do here, so this is step one of two.

316
00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:31.320
Jones, Edward R: And notice it says is switch account Z you're getting ready to go into the deep hole so last chance last chance.

317
00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:49.020
Jones, Edward R: keep going click continue all right now here's what you need to do, and some of you may not recognize this this default the account type deeds faults to business they sure hope your business because that's who they make money from they make money from advertising with business people.

318
00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:53.850
Jones, Edward R: that's what this is all about now tell them i'm an individual.

319
00:41:55.080 --> 00:42:03.300
Jones, Edward R: And you know they're going to be disappointed about that, but anyway, you must change this from business to individual if you don't do that.

320
00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:14.940
Jones, Edward R: you're going to get all kinds of marketing stuff between here and where you want to go and tell us about your company and how many people work there, and how much money do you make and.

321
00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:28.020
Jones, Edward R: taka taka it's all about selling you something else, and then, of course, you put your name and your address all it's just Allah de I don't live at 999 my street address.

322
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:31.710
Jones, Edward R: My real address here.

323
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:45.720
Jones, Edward R: But OK, and then, of course, if you scroll on down a little bit payment method we don't want you to go far without telling us how you're going to pay for this okay.

324
00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:57.570
Jones, Edward R: If you're just somebody off the street some teenager hacking around we're not gonna let you in so they want a valid credit or debit card or debit card or PayPal and.

325
00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.840
Jones, Edward R: All things the how about a bank account.

326
00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:07.350
Jones, Edward R: No, not doing that it's easy to tear up a credit card it's difficult to get rid of the Bank.

327
00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:17.700
Jones, Edward R: So don't check that now if you're a business, you might have you might have to want to go there, but as an individual now just use a credit card that you can destroy.

328
00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:36.180
Jones, Edward R: And then you crypt on start my free trial really it's not free okay it's only free if you don't make your choose of it and we're not, by the way, so, although everybody's been using my credentials, which has been showing up on my credit card it's like $2.

329
00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:46.200
Jones, Edward R: So this is really designed for the big business users loop guys, who are going to put code in an APP and then sell the APP right.

330
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:53.010
Jones, Edward R: And then they're going to send it out they're going to sell thousands of copies and every time somebody uses that APP and being so critical.

331
00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:58.530
Jones, Edward R: Okay, not maybe only a penny, but if you got thousands of them eventually led up to real money.

332
00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:08.160
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so this is the dashboard once you get this far you get into what's called the cloud dashboard you must have seen this if you tried to do your credentials.

333
00:44:08.490 --> 00:44:13.020
Jones, Edward R: I hope you got this far, this is critical to everything that happens now.

334
00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:26.010
Jones, Edward R: From this dashboard you can get anywhere within the cloud So if you ever get confused about what where Am I click up here, you see, where it says, Google cloud platform this guy up here click on it.

335
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:36.600
Jones, Edward R: And it takes you back to the dashboard now the dashboard lets you navigate around and for example billing right here that little if you're worried about your credit card click on billing.

336
00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:51.960
Jones, Edward R: And you can remove your card, you can you know take it out of their clothes or billing down or if you closed it down by the way, then they're not they're going to close down your account basically your your credentials are not going to work until you activate the billing.

337
00:44:53.280 --> 00:45:00.960
Jones, Edward R: The api's and services, there are over 300 api's and services that are available in Google.

338
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:03.900
Jones, Edward R: we're only looking at the best ones.

339
00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:14.670
Jones, Edward R: But I think the best and you can, if you want to know what they are about if you want to get one of them and use it on your desk in your API click here.

340
00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:20.010
Jones, Edward R: Now, if you need support, which by the way, it's not free, you can click here.

341
00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:37.290
Jones, Edward R: Well, they have a huge library of fyi faqs and things like that click support and it'll give you a whole bunch of information, and in particular about things like billing How does this really work, but the billing is very confusing.

342
00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:46.380
Jones, Edward R: honestly about the only way you figured out how it really works is to run it for a while and see what happens.

343
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:59.190
Jones, Edward R: that's because each API each API has a different billing strategy yeah we're anyway it's another intuitively obvious how everything's happening.

344
00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:13.440
Jones, Edward R: I am I am and administrator, this is a useful click as well, because this is going to take you to a lot of sort of management information on your cloud account your API account.

345
00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:29.040
Jones, Edward R: And okay so here, you can see, go to the checklist to make sure you've got everything the end billing there mainly the billing that everything has been approved and so forth, and so on, and probably that's just fine.

346
00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:30.660
Jones, Edward R: Now.

347
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:40.020
Jones, Edward R: next thing I would do is I would go to a right here, it says this is amon still on the dashboard okay.

348
00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:51.810
Jones, Edward R: Their own little boxes on the dashboard and notice that the upper left hand box this project information, and right now there's no information in here at all.

349
00:46:52.410 --> 00:47:01.740
Jones, Edward R: Because I haven't entered anything So the first thing you want to do is give it a project name, and so you click here, it says go to project settings.

350
00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:03.000
And I just go.

351
00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:06.150
Karen Fireman: Jones can I skip questions Karen.

352
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:06.990
Jones, Edward R: Sure care.

353
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:11.550
Karen Fireman: If we're on the dashboard and we don't see that we don't see that project.

354
00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.890
Karen Fireman: box, what do we do to get to it.

355
00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:20.010
Jones, Edward R: um well, let me, let me go back and see what your questions are at here.

356
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:20.370
Karen Fireman: let's see.

357
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.380
Karen Fireman: We have to be an I am to see it.

358
00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:23.580
uh.

359
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:25.980
Jones, Edward R: I believe, if you just click home.

360
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.720
Karen Fireman: Okay we're in home.

361
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:28.830
Jones, Edward R: But and dashboard.

362
00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:35.070
Karen Fireman: No, but it doesn't show up it's just empty there Oh, it says, create project, so you got to do that okay.

363
00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:36.090
Jones, Edward R: The yeah.

364
00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:38.520
Jones, Edward R: that's what i'm talking about right here, right here.

365
00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.560
Jones, Edward R: see it says go to project study well.

366
00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.300
Karen Fireman: it's not there, but it's elsewhere, it is on the.

367
00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:50.370
Jones, Edward R: yeah This is very confusing to me I don't know you know because it's, not that I don't know anyway.

368
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.990
Jones, Edward R: We.

369
00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:59.250
Karen Fireman: At the organization that's something that messed me up, I thought you told us to put tammy and when I put 10 Oh, is it really doesn't like it.

370
00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:00.990
Jones, Edward R: Oh no I don't you know why.

371
00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:04.050
Jones, Edward R: No, this you use the template EDU.

372
00:48:04.650 --> 00:48:06.810
Karen Fireman: Apparently it's what it put on there yeah.

373
00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:08.790
Jones, Edward R: Well, the problem with that is.

374
00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:15.450
Jones, Edward R: taboo is an organization, it is a business and they got an account and you're not the owner.

375
00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:17.910
Karen Fireman: Right and So what do I do to fix it either.

376
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:19.290
Jones, Edward R: campaigns have to make the.

377
00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.960
Jones, Edward R: don't say you're a business so you're an individual.

378
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:25.980
Karen Fireman: But do I have to throw this account away just because I did that I can't change.

379
00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:34.980
Jones, Edward R: A actually I would yeah if you've set it up, if you set it up under your EDU email address I would get another address that's restart.

380
00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:46.770
Karen Fireman: Because trying to restart it goes back into the Google effects grabbed from the the way it always grabs our email, and it goes right in and knows me from there, it doesn't.

381
00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:53.790
Jones, Edward R: make you login you have to log into the other email account before you open this up.

382
00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:54.960
Oh.

383
00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:57.090
Jones, Edward R: So.

384
00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.230
there's usually a lower.

385
00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:01.740
Jones, Edward R: right hand corner, it says login you click on it.

386
00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:10.830
Jones, Edward R: And you can log out log out of the EDU account and then log into a generic gmail account.

387
00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:12.060
Karen Fireman: Oh.

388
00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:13.140
Jones, Edward R: Okay yeah.

389
00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:17.610
Jones, Edward R: Well, this is a saying in the by the same thing hey the same thing happened to me.

390
00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:31.890
Jones, Edward R: I tried my best to get this to align with the tam Bu EDU email, and then I and everything seems to be working I was going down I got the King setup and looking good looking good and then I get to the part on the credentials and it says.

391
00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:34.260
Jones, Edward R: you're not getting anything.

392
00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:40.530
Jones, Edward R: Because you're not the owner of the of this domain, which is true.

393
00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:48.810
Jones, Edward R: Somebody on campus is the owner of it is the owner of that domain and they don't you know they don't want.

394
00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:52.920
Jones, Edward R: citizen faculty charging stuff.

395
00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:54.450
Jones, Edward R: Out there.

396
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:57.210
Karen Fireman: We put nothing, what do we put as the organization.

397
00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:58.560
Jones, Edward R: what's that.

398
00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:00.810
Karen Fireman: What do we put that as the organization.

399
00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:04.320
Jones, Edward R: Individual nothing, nothing.

400
00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:10.140
Jones, Edward R: Oh, so let me go back, let me back up here before about one or two slides.

401
00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:17.820
Jones, Edward R: When you are still signing up originally right here, where it says account type, this is step, two have to.

402
00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:20.520
Jones, Edward R: write sure this says individual.

403
00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:23.010
Karen Fireman: Okay, well, I made that mistake, obviously I.

404
00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:25.620
Jones, Edward R: doubt if you say this doesn't do it.

405
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:29.970
Jones, Edward R: Well, the only way to do it is to start over with a new email.

406
00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:31.860
Karen Fireman: gotcha now okay.

407
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:35.550
Karen Fireman: yeah start over by it kept going to the other email I didn't know.

408
00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:40.650
Jones, Edward R: I had to be in the other one yeah hey listen hours, I spent hours trying to figure this out.

409
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:43.950
Karen Fireman: Get that because I tried it a few times.

410
00:50:45.090 --> 00:50:50.220
Jones, Edward R: yeah yeah if you do not change this, the individual that wants to know the organization.

411
00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:55.470
Jones, Edward R: And they wants to know billing and who's in and wants you to be the owner and be indiana.

412
00:50:57.030 --> 00:51:14.430
Jones, Edward R: So we have to, we have to do this as an individual private person and so just set up a bogus gmail address it's actually not bogus and you may you have you been to look at it and use it and you need another gmail address it's not related to the EDU.

413
00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:16.140
Jones, Edward R: address.

414
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:17.730
Karen Fireman: Okay, so as long as.

415
00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:21.360
Jones, Edward R: Part of the part of the confusion here is that TIM you EDU is.

416
00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:22.860
Karen Fireman: A Google address.

417
00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:24.780
Karen Fireman: Right okay like that.

418
00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:39.240
Jones, Edward R: And we do get access to like Google drive and so other things that we've been using sort of routinely, but when you branch out and say, I want to use your API well, which are the where they're making money then oh nope sorry.

419
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:41.430
Jones, Edward R: You don't want it.

420
00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:44.820
Jones, Edward R: Okay, I get it so.

421
00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:59.880
Jones, Edward R: All right, so maybe someday this will change, but for now we need to set up the account type as individual and the they won't ask you very much for an organization don't just say just leave it Blank or just say none is what I did.

422
00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:01.860
Karen Fireman: Okay, thank you.

423
00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:04.830
Jones, Edward R: Okay yeah yeah well that's why i'm going through this.

424
00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:16.650
Jones, Edward R: Because you're not alone I it happened to me and i'm sure you know, so that now you you finally get to this little areas, this project info my first project, which means you don't have one.

425
00:52:17.310 --> 00:52:22.680
Jones, Edward R: And then you have a project number and an ID that's assigned automatically by Google and you can't change it.

426
00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:33.870
Jones, Edward R: Okay, this is the number this number is linked to your credit card basically that's how they know who you are now you click on the bottom, one which says go to project settings.

427
00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:53.520
Jones, Edward R: And when you do that, you see this page and you are allowed know to create a project name, something that you can relate to, and you can have several projects and your account for me I just called it is tm 601 but you might call it Karen or something.

428
00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:55.380
Karen Fireman: I will I project.

429
00:52:55.590 --> 00:53:10.590
Jones, Edward R: My project or your husband's name or something like that, and once you type in whatever you want to call this and you click on save over on the right hand side and that then then when you see that little box next time you see it your project name will be in a box.

430
00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:12.240
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

431
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:19.950
Jones, Edward R: that's it Thank you re Max there you go see is tm six oh honest my project name.

432
00:53:20.970 --> 00:53:23.580
Jones, Edward R: Okay next step next step.

433
00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:41.580
Jones, Edward R: Go to API is there's another box for the api's go to the api's overview now if you don't see that box on your dashboard if you look on the left hand side there's a thing it says ap guys there's a there is a.

434
00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:58.710
Jones, Edward R: Sometimes there's a navigation sort of bar right over on the left and one of the elements in that bars api's you can click on that or you can click on go to the API server view you'll go to the same place, and the same and that place is.

435
00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:00.990
Jones, Edward R: That are this.

436
00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:10.890
Jones, Edward R: notice at the top, it says api's and services, and it shows you all of the api's that are automatically linked to your account.

437
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:30.150
Jones, Edward R: The only one here that really is pretty obvious is are needed is the one that says cloud storage and, basically, this is the API that lets you save stuff on the cloud and up to a certain point that's free.

438
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:32.820
Jones, Edward R: small point actually.

439
00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:36.600
Jones, Edward R: For us it's it's more than sufficient.

440
00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:57.600
Jones, Edward R: And then on the left hand side, you can see that i'm now in the dashboard for the ap is next step, you see, where it says library and credentials eventually we're going to get your credentials, but let's not go there just laying just yet first click on library okay.

441
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:08.640
Jones, Edward R: And when this comes up oh isn't that Nice isn't that Nice notice over here, it says public api's 316.

442
00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:20.580
Jones, Edward R: Public api's are on the cloud well that's very exciting because I haven't seen all that many of them, and there must be some other ones in there, that I want to see.

443
00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:43.500
Jones, Edward R: But the there are quite a few having to do with speech text vision that's what we're talking about in this class first part of the class anyway good thing is, you can search, you can search on api's so I suggest that you start by searching on text to speech.

444
00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:48.660
Jones, Edward R: So just type in the search box here text to speech.

445
00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:58.650
Jones, Edward R: or speech to text whichever one and you're going to get something like this and it's here the api's and say something about text to speech.

446
00:55:59.430 --> 00:56:06.480
Jones, Edward R: One of them, the first one cloud text to speech API we're talking about this tonight, this is a, for I think this is the first one we're going to go over.

447
00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:19.440
Jones, Edward R: The second one we're going to go over is the next one, which is speech to text API okay now in order to use these api's they need to be linked to your account so that's why we're here.

448
00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:28.530
Jones, Edward R: we're here to link these api's to our account so click on one of them it doesn't matter which one I clicked on here text to speech.

449
00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:45.000
Jones, Edward R: And then, it comes up oh text to speech notice the big blue bar but says enable you click on that and, basically, you are saying, I want to use this API I want you to enable it for my account.

450
00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:51.360
Jones, Edward R: By the way, at the bottom there's there's some move of gobbledygook information about pricing.

451
00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:57.720
Jones, Edward R: And I think I know what it's doing, but every this pricing business down here at the bottom.

452
00:56:58.170 --> 00:57:10.620
Jones, Edward R: is always a little different depending upon the API and a lot of those is, if you read the details on pricing it's a terminology driven the goodness is it's very low pricing is very low for.

453
00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:19.620
Jones, Edward R: doing the kind of things that we're doing well, as I say, if you build an API and you sell thousands of copies, and you have thousands of customers doing this.

454
00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:32.190
Jones, Edward R: You see it's using a fraction of a penny every so many Bytes and eventually that adds up to some money and Google is going to you know bill your credit card automatically for that money.

455
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:42.930
Jones, Edward R: I mean the good news is for us it's like $2 with the whole class I think it's $2 or something like that so not to worry so enable this click enable.

456
00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:47.670
Jones, Edward R: Good things happen, but things happen when you enable it.

457
00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:59.970
Jones, Edward R: Oh, it says oh wait a minute billing is required in order to use whoa this we charge money for this, I know I know I saw the money it's not much okay.

458
00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:11.790
Jones, Edward R: But they want you to double check and say, yes, enable billing if you do not enable billing they will not link the API to your account, so this is required.

459
00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:19.980
Jones, Edward R: don't be too, I would say i'm always concerned and suspicious when I see this sort of thing that sounds kind of heavy handed but.

460
00:58:20.850 --> 00:58:30.630
Jones, Edward R: If you don't if you're just doing this for educational purposes and then development purposes and you use relatively small files in your processing, which we are.

461
00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:41.670
Jones, Edward R: Then the building that's going to be really minor or zero they give you a certain amount of free usage and for us that covers pretty much the whole thing.

462
00:58:42.810 --> 00:59:04.680
Jones, Edward R: Okay, all of us so enable building and when that happens, then notice what happens over here if you now the you know it says oh oh you wait, it says, create on the right hand side here, it says, create what does it say I can't see it on my screen create.

463
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:09.960
Jones, Edward R: Oh click to download credentials.

464
00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:12.930
Jones, Edward R: see that upper right hand button.

465
00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:20.760
Jones, Edward R: Where i'm you see where i'm pointing right, let me see what I got up here, right here or appear upper right hand corner so there's The thing is just click to download.

466
00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:33.420
Jones, Edward R: credentials, you see that, yes, or is it, this is how you get your credentials, the first API that you register and you enable billing they give you credentials.

467
00:59:33.930 --> 00:59:44.550
Jones, Edward R: Those credentials are not going to change, by the way they are used with all of the api's the same credentials will work with all the other api's that you add.

468
00:59:44.970 --> 00:59:57.960
Jones, Edward R: But as you add the api's you will not see that button, you only see it on the first time right, so the first API you order you you you access and you authorize.

469
00:59:58.470 --> 01:00:06.330
Jones, Edward R: Be sure you click credentials and it will create credentials rather and then it'll download them then to your download file.

470
01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:15.870
Jones, Edward R: And look for them find them and put them in some area that you know where that's at, and you can protect them, by the way, you can change the name that file name is ugly.

471
01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:28.770
Jones, Edward R: And you can change that to something like Google credentials, so that you know what that file is it's a Jason J so in file make sure that it is in seven where the you know and make sure that.

472
01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:38.940
Jones, Edward R: You know you protected, because if somebody gets that then they can use your credentials to use the API which means whatever they do you get billed for.

473
01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:46.920
Jones, Edward R: Until you until you kill it, by the way, you can disconnect you can tell them to kill the API or kill the credentials.

474
01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:55.890
Jones, Edward R: it's very, very easy if you go to the credentials, if you click over here on the left, it says credentials it'll go to the credentials window which lets you.

475
01:00:56.670 --> 01:01:06.660
Jones, Edward R: Take care of that you can delete the credentials and then reauthorized or get new ones, so I will watch the billing thing going on, make sure there's nothing really crazy.

476
01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:14.730
Jones, Edward R: going on and but if there was something crazy going on, I would basically delete those credentials and reauthorize him or create new ones.

477
01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:19.440
Jones, Edward R: But never had any problems with this okay.

478
01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:21.330
Karen Fireman: One question Sir do.

479
01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:28.620
Karen Fireman: It yeah just to tell them which APP we're using so we just click on this cloud text to speech APP.

480
01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:30.180
Jones, Edward R: It doesn't matter.

481
01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:35.760
Jones, Edward R: You do you have to we're only going to click on Apps that we're going to use.

482
01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:40.620
Karen Fireman: Well, they asked are we planning to use this APP with APP engine or compute engine.

483
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:47.580
Jones, Edward R: Yes, no, no, no, no, no, oh yeah Oh, I think you said that the that the next one.

484
01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:49.290
Karen Fireman: Well, it came up from mine.

485
01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:54.270
Jones, Edward R: yeah there's some little thing that says, you are you going to use this for compute engine click no.

486
01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:56.160
Karen Fireman: No i'm not using them.

487
01:01:56.250 --> 01:01:58.740
Jones, Edward R: No, we have no with no intention to be doing that.

488
01:01:59.070 --> 01:02:00.630
Karen Fireman: APP engine or compute engine okay.

489
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:02.160
Jones, Edward R: That is correct click no.

490
01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:03.300
Jones, Edward R: Okay yeah.

491
01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:05.550
Jones, Edward R: Forget it.

492
01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:06.420
Karen Fireman: Now it's.

493
01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:08.460
Jones, Edward R: Now here, this is.

494
01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.480
Karen Fireman: He sending.

495
01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:24.900
Jones, Edward R: It says add credentials to your project so when you say create credentials, this is what comes up and then you select the APP you're adding it for speech to text or text to speech and then click no right here that's what you're asking about Karen.

496
01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:30.720
Jones, Edward R: yeah it says, am I, using the blah blah blah blah I don't even know what those things are doing so.

497
01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:47.970
Jones, Edward R: Right at this point, no we're not doing that, so what credentials Do I need to continue on down this, this is a long, long page, by the way, so you go down below and it says add credentials to your projects and then you want the.

498
01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:49.920
Jones, Edward R: select.

499
01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:55.560
Jones, Edward R: select your role and put your name your service account name in here.

500
01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.280
Karen Fireman: What are the What are those what's our role and what their service account name.

501
01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:00.360
Jones, Edward R: Well, let me show you.

502
01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:11.430
Jones, Edward R: The ID just put in your name I put an e Jones right and then that service account name is attached to your account ID.

503
01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:18.120
Jones, Edward R: And then you select the role and the role here should be owner that's like the highest level.

504
01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:35.490
Jones, Edward R: The highest level okay as an individual you're only the owner okay now if you had a team of people working and they were all using the same credentials, then you somebody would be the owner and that owner is allowed to modify the credentials or hurt or destroy them.

505
01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:37.770
Jones, Edward R: But, but the.

506
01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:52.680
Jones, Edward R: But then others, you could have the role of viewer or editor change them or browsing you know so billing and so forth, and so on, so you're you're a role here is going to be owner owner.

507
01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:54.540
Jones, Edward R: project.

508
01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:56.850
Jones, Edward R: rice, but it says select a role.

509
01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:02.040
Jones, Edward R: and go to projects, yes ma'am project owner first thing.

510
01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:08.040
Jones, Edward R: Now the rest of this i'm not even sure what it is.

511
01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.320
Jones, Edward R: Key type Jason.

512
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:14.040
Jones, Edward R: don't change it, and then click continue.

513
01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:16.110
Jones, Edward R: right here.

514
01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:20.130
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

515
01:04:24.450 --> 01:04:25.440
Jones, Edward R: All right now.

516
01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:42.810
Jones, Edward R: Add credentials to the project so as you can see, then, before you click continue here double check make sure your initials or your name is right here, your role is owner and that file type or the credentials type is Jason.

517
01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:45.090
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

518
01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:49.920
Jones, Edward R: And let's see and at this point, I think.

519
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:58.830
Jones, Edward R: it's it basically my computer says hey this Google wants to download something should I allow you click allow.

520
01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:04.350
Jones, Edward R: And then, it comes down to your download folder and about two seconds one second.

521
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:08.640
Karen Fireman: Well, mine mine mine went somewhere, but I don't know where.

522
01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:12.060
Jones, Edward R: Oh well, read Taiwan.

523
01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:18.030
Jones, Edward R: Where was it on my computer whenever I do this it comes down to my downloads folder.

524
01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:19.920
Jones, Edward R: Okay well.

525
01:05:20.130 --> 01:05:21.450
Jones, Edward R: Before yeah.

526
01:05:22.830 --> 01:05:25.110
Jones, Edward R: But now what happens on your computer.

527
01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:33.630
Jones, Edward R: search and then she says it says oh there's your folder and then there's your traditional name.

528
01:05:34.050 --> 01:05:37.170
Karen Fireman: yeah I saw that but it flew by me, but then I didn't know where it went.

529
01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:38.070
yeah.

530
01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:42.480
Jones, Edward R: You can search on that name and the heavy computer search from that name.

531
01:05:43.650 --> 01:05:45.450
Jones, Edward R: Okay, all Jason files.

532
01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.700
Jones, Edward R: But you will I change that name as quickly as I can, because that's just an ugly name.

533
01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:52.200
Jones, Edward R: and

534
01:05:53.610 --> 01:06:08.490
Jones, Edward R: When you click on credentials, if you do this and you click on credentials you'll see at the bottom, it says service accounts, right here and that's it's basically saying this person, this is the credentials down here so.

535
01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:17.040
Jones, Edward R: Now here's the here's one for cloud the translation API you want to do you want to link that one into your account to.

536
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:27.990
Jones, Edward R: Now, this should have already been done in the homework number three cloud translation API should have been enabled if you got your credentials, then this, we would have enabled we would have gone through this process.

537
01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:37.530
Jones, Edward R: And I know some several students would do where did that and then there's a third one, we want to make sure that gets enabled, which is the text speech.

538
01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:46.050
Jones, Edward R: text to speech speech to text and text to speech you want to enable both of those and you want to enable the translate API.

539
01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:51.720
Jones, Edward R: Now there is a fourth one which is storage, but that is done automatically.

540
01:06:53.610 --> 01:06:55.020
Jones, Edward R: that's enabled automatically.

541
01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:56.880
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

542
01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:02.940
Jones, Edward R: Now, if you click to I am.

543
01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.400
Jones, Edward R: If you will Peter the still.

544
01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:13.440
Jones, Edward R: Three little horizontal lines and you click on I am I am.

545
01:07:16.110 --> 01:07:34.200
Jones, Edward R: right here, I am, this is what happens when you click on these little lines at the top, you get this this link navigation link on the left, you can go to API is, which was where we were just going and now we're going to go to I am an administration.

546
01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:39.180
Jones, Edward R: i'm not sure what I am stands for, but.

547
01:07:41.100 --> 01:08:04.080
Jones, Edward R: Okay, if you go to I am I am in administration bunch of stuff is sitting here settings roles, most of this is pretty boring stuff that have to do with the management of your project now for an individual or just a small number of people working on a project you most of this is boring.

548
01:08:05.550 --> 01:08:18.240
Jones, Edward R: The one thing that's not too boring but could be his quote us this guy right down here at the bottom, the bottom left left it says quotas, if you click on that.

549
01:08:19.290 --> 01:08:28.440
Jones, Edward R: which I did here then you'll see this page that's basically showing you all of the api's that are linked to your account.

550
01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:35.580
Jones, Edward R: Including the ones that are automatically now here, the first two or the cloud translation.

551
01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:48.210
Jones, Edward R: API the rest of them big query API Okay, there are so proud of their search engine, the big query API is attached automatically everybody's everybody's account.

552
01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:58.470
Jones, Edward R: Now the crowd crowd cloud translation right up here if you see green checks everywhere, this is a good thing.

553
01:08:59.730 --> 01:09:05.040
Jones, Edward R: The Green check says here that every every API has a quota now.

554
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:14.310
Jones, Edward R: I don't know why they say quota because, basically, what it is, is a limit and upper limit on how much you can do with that API.

555
01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:19.800
Jones, Edward R: And by the way, there's it's basically a default limit right and.

556
01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:27.060
Jones, Edward R: For example, in the Korean translation API if you're going to translate a local file.

557
01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:40.440
Jones, Edward R: or a local string that you type in it cannot be more than 2000 characters long if it's more than 2000 characters you're going to get a little error message from Google, it says something about too big.

558
01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:46.110
Jones, Edward R: you're exceeding your quota, this is where the term quota comes from.

559
01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:58.230
Jones, Edward R: So if you want the details on what floaters do I have on translate go here click on all quotas and it will show you oh here's the there's a quote on the side of the field.

560
01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:09.810
Jones, Edward R: The size of the file, there is a limit on how many characters in there, there is a limit on how many times, you can access this API and i'm on okay.

561
01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:14.160
Jones, Edward R: And the reason they're doing this is because.

562
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:32.970
Jones, Edward R: Well, first of all, if you're making a big use of something that's one of these things they want to know about, so they can charge you that they're they're looking at their charges and everything, however, it wouldn't be possible, as you can see, to write a program a robot.

563
01:10:34.050 --> 01:10:42.090
Jones, Edward R: That fake this and then showered the API with overloaded, the API to make bring down the whole cloud okay.

564
01:10:43.290 --> 01:10:53.520
Jones, Edward R: The service called service attack where they they just use so much I bet boom boom boom boom boom eventually the computer is going to croak and slow down.

565
01:10:53.580 --> 01:11:02.220
Jones, Edward R: and possibly crash and things like that, so they have an upper limit on how much you can get away with and that's for every API you have a quota.

566
01:11:03.330 --> 01:11:12.450
Jones, Edward R: What they're actually multiple folders that have to do with the size of the file how often you access the API it permitted.

567
01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:21.600
Jones, Edward R: And how often you exercise per month, so the good thing, of course, is to prevent hackers from messing up thanks okay.

568
01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:41.550
Jones, Edward R: Well, at least, Buddhists, are fairly generous for our purposes, so you probably won't know i'll talk a little bit about some of the limits on translation and speech to text and so forth, that that we can run into and and what happens when that when that occurs so that's it.

569
01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:50.340
Jones, Edward R: that's it for credentials, I hope you learn something from that and if you already got your credentials congratulations, so if you don't please get them.

570
01:11:50.970 --> 01:11:57.360
Jones, Edward R: to guide to get them and even even if you already have them go out and explore the dashboard and see.

571
01:11:58.050 --> 01:12:07.530
Jones, Edward R: See make sure you've got those three ap is well actually for translating the storage, you should already have but add to that text to speech.

572
01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:20.340
Jones, Edward R: And speech to text no big deal let's take a 10 minute break here get something to drink and then we're going to come back and we're going to talk about how do I convert text to speech, this is so exciting.

573
01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:22.500
Karen Fireman: And question Jones on.

574
01:12:22.530 --> 01:12:23.580
Jones, Edward R: Just when I want to click on.

575
01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:27.120
Jones, Edward R: yeah so that's where we are now right now Okay, yes.

576
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:28.980
Karen Fireman: Dr Jones quick question it's Karen.

577
01:12:30.210 --> 01:12:39.360
Karen Fireman: Just to go back to check my credentials i'm not the credentials, but to enable these other packages that he said translate which thing do I go back to right now.

578
01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:43.950
Jones, Edward R: Well, let me back up here, you want to go to your dashboard right.

579
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:46.230
Jones, Edward R: Okay, and.

580
01:12:47.670 --> 01:12:52.290
Jones, Edward R: right here, if you if you click on these bars on the top.

581
01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:53.070
Karen Fireman: Okay.

582
01:12:53.130 --> 01:12:55.500
Jones, Edward R: And you see where it says api's and services.

583
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:56.760
Jones, Edward R: yeah click there.

584
01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:12.240
Jones, Edward R: Okay it'll show you when you click there, it will show you what api's are already enabled and you have that search window, where you can type like text to speech or speech to text in that search window and it'll boom it'll bring up the API that you're looking for.

585
01:13:13.170 --> 01:13:13.680
Karen Fireman: Okay.

586
01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:15.390
Jones, Edward R: Thank you look good luck.

587
01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:15.840
Karen Fireman: Thanks.

588
01:13:15.930 --> 01:13:18.000
Jones, Edward R: Have a good Sunday drink yes.

589
01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:21.720
Jones, Edward R: Go get something to drink okay.

590
01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:23.970
Jones, Edward R: What am I doing yeah.

591
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:30.990
Karen Fireman: Dr Jones That was really great I got it I got them all enabled Thank you so much for your help.

592
01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:36.450
Jones, Edward R: Okay let's let's see if we get back on course here.

593
01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:43.380
Jones, Edward R: So it's 730 let's see how far we can get here in the next hour so.

594
01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:59.910
Jones, Edward R: Alright, so we're going to talk about first we're going to talk about text to speech and then we'll talk about doing the reverse, and it turns out that the api's are very different and there's some good reasons for that.

595
01:25:01.950 --> 01:25:10.770
Jones, Edward R: let's talk about this one, I think it's a little bit easier it's less complicated the text to speech one so i'm going to go for this one first.

596
01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:21.690
Jones, Edward R: it's important that you register the text to speech API with your credentials otherwise when you go to use the text.

597
01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:37.560
Jones, Edward R: To speech API your credentials may not may be rejected right, so we want to go to our dashboard we want to click on go to API overview and then, if you look at your desk word, you should see a list of credentials down here.

598
01:25:38.730 --> 01:25:44.250
Jones, Edward R: That this described that are enabled and that would include text to speech.

599
01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:55.680
Jones, Edward R: And if it's not there, you can go to your library, you can search on text to speech, and then you can of course bring it up.

600
01:25:56.490 --> 01:26:04.710
Jones, Edward R: And you can click on this text to speech now there's a URL up here, if you want to go directly to it bypass your your dashboard.

601
01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:24.900
Jones, Edward R: You can go to this URL Google club.com slash test text to speech and what you have here is a description of what this API can do for you, and in particular there's a link here, you see it says documentation that's the current documentation.

602
01:26:26.220 --> 01:26:43.350
Jones, Edward R: And then, it talks about how it's being used right now and it says a boy spots in contact centers now did you ever call you of course you've called up the Bank and it says Okay, do you want to speak Spanish or English, this is a computer right.

603
01:26:44.370 --> 01:26:54.930
Jones, Edward R: Okay press one if you want to talk about billing press two if you want to talk about this or that you know that's all being done by this API or something similar to it.

604
01:26:56.040 --> 01:27:06.840
Jones, Edward R: This API will generate the voice that you're hearing on those phone calls and when you respond and say, yes, no or i'm usually.

605
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:20.520
Jones, Edward R: yellow something like that you don't have to computer, then they they decode the conversation they decode what you're saying and take a just things accordingly, so if you click on documentation here.

606
01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:23.280
Jones, Edward R: It will take you to.

607
01:27:24.450 --> 01:27:36.750
Jones, Edward R: A little form here, it says text to speech basics, I would encourage you to take a look at that, by the way, the first thing they're going to talk about is building.

608
01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:48.600
Jones, Edward R: Of course, do you have a credit card, if you have a levy, I know that kind of stuff and so you love that you can just skip down until you get down to the actual coding part.

609
01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:52.950
Jones, Edward R: There is another one over here says quick starts.

610
01:27:54.330 --> 01:28:01.170
Jones, Edward R: And how to get how to guides these have actual code examples that you might find useful.

611
01:28:03.150 --> 01:28:08.640
Jones, Edward R: But tonight i'm going to tell you, everything you need to know about this thing so don't get to him don't have to feel too bad about that.

612
01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:20.460
Jones, Edward R: There are many applications, the text to speech incoming text can be almost any language so this API allows you to specify the language for the incoming text.

613
01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:35.520
Jones, Edward R: Is a Spanish is an English is a French and so forth, and so on, now it's not complete, it has I don't know how many languages, many, many more than I could ever had understand.

614
01:28:36.510 --> 01:28:45.630
Jones, Edward R: But there are some that are obviously missing well you'll notice, for example, Farsi or person is not in the list of.

615
01:28:46.200 --> 01:29:03.630
Jones, Edward R: them that language list, and so you can translate text into part of Farsi, but this is a different thing, this is a different animal we're translating texts here into spoken language into an audio recording we're producing an audio recording from a text file.

616
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:16.170
Jones, Edward R: The text has some language in it and then based upon the computer API knowledge of that language, it can then convert that text into a recording and audio recording.

617
01:29:17.010 --> 01:29:27.630
Jones, Edward R: Now we can combine the translation, the translation API with the text to speech API and we can again get very creative.

618
01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:38.250
Jones, Edward R: We might have text, for example, that's in Chinese so we can use the translate feature, to take the Chinese text and produced English.

619
01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:44.430
Jones, Edward R: And then we can use the text to speech to produce an audio recording of that text.

620
01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:55.890
Jones, Edward R: Now why would you want to do this well, if you want to provide voice instruction instead of written instructions for some particular thing this is way you would do it.

621
01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:04.260
Jones, Edward R: If you're if you're programming a ton of US vehicles and really most of what we're talking about here is that's where it's really going.

622
01:30:04.710 --> 01:30:11.670
Jones, Edward R: In the next 10 to 20 years you're going to see an explosion of business related to self driving vehicles.

623
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:23.910
Jones, Edward R: And that's going to involve communications that's going to involve verbal communication, so you already see that with siri and alexa and they have several devices, you can talk to you in your home.

624
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:34.620
Jones, Edward R: I don't have one I wouldn't never what I have one side, just to old school anyway siri I disconnect I just don't like get arguing with a computer.

625
01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:46.620
Jones, Edward R: But that's what those are all about is that they are trying to build they are building ways in which people can communicate with computers boy music and audio instead of text or typing.

626
01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:52.980
Jones, Edward R: So we can in self driving vehicles you're not going to be typing you're going to be talking to the car.

627
01:30:53.460 --> 01:31:00.480
Jones, Edward R: And the car is going to be talking to you they've already already do it right turn right and 100 feet your turn right on high wi fi.

628
01:31:01.170 --> 01:31:10.770
Jones, Edward R: that's that's all voice generated stopped by a computer and with the API that we're talking about here, we can actually make that happen.

629
01:31:11.250 --> 01:31:24.270
Jones, Edward R: We could build a navigation API that talk to you and the details you oh in 100 feet you're going to need to turn right and then you're going to go another hundred feet in turn left, right and we're going to make that happen and we're going to put that in any language you want.

630
01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:29.130
Jones, Edward R: Chinese Japanese you know, English, what have you.

631
01:31:30.990 --> 01:31:34.980
Jones, Edward R: So we're going to produce voice instructions and navigation systems in cars.

632
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:44.790
Jones, Edward R: The cars may also have other instructions like pull over at the next gas station, I need more or less tricity in this case.

633
01:31:46.830 --> 01:32:00.660
Jones, Edward R: And if they're critical for time real time instructions like navigation, as I mentioned to text to speech is a very important tool in a lot of commercial enterprises that we're going to be seeing more and more.

634
01:32:01.710 --> 01:32:10.560
Jones, Edward R: 10 years ago we wouldn't even be talking about this, because it wasn't possible to do this, the computers were not strong enough, they were not fast enough.

635
01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:20.070
Jones, Edward R: And that and, frankly, the technology, which is the what we're us doing here is called deep learning technology, where they teach the computer how to speak the language or how to.

636
01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:25.470
Jones, Edward R: How to process change text into the audit process spoken words and things like that that's deep learning.

637
01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:30.150
Jones, Edward R: they're using neural networks for that and we'll see we'll look at this later on in the course.

638
01:32:31.050 --> 01:32:40.680
Jones, Edward R: So text to speech, there are actually three different animals here three different animals, animal number one is local text files, I want to take a local file.

639
01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:50.640
Jones, Edward R: and turn that into speech okay that requires file to be small, less than one megabyte 1.5 megabytes.

640
01:32:51.450 --> 01:33:03.930
Jones, Edward R: So if you want to transfer, if you want to convert a local file into speech that the the outgoing file needs to be less than 1.5 megabytes I believe and the.

641
01:33:04.830 --> 01:33:16.290
Jones, Edward R: text file, I think, is restricted to 5000 characters or something you have to look it up, so there are restrictions here, there were say that these local text files cannot be enormous why.

642
01:33:17.130 --> 01:33:27.300
Jones, Edward R: Because Google wants you to use the a synchronous larger text file mode, which is number two and this mode requires those files to be in the cloud.

643
01:33:28.110 --> 01:33:37.860
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so you have to upload them into the cloud and it's not hard to do that will show we'll be talking about how to get those files in the cloud it's not hard to do that, but.

644
01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:46.530
Jones, Edward R: Here, using Google storage and Oh, by the way, there's a small fee for that now for what we're doing is it gets like pennies but.

645
01:33:47.130 --> 01:33:56.100
Jones, Edward R: You can see how this might work on if you have, but this application running and autonomous vehicle and you've just sold like 50,000 of these vehicles.

646
01:33:56.850 --> 01:34:12.570
Jones, Edward R: And everybody is doing this navigation stuff and they're going up to the cloud yeah that's gonna be a lot of the kind of be a lot of files so and a lot of money to Google, the last thing the last category of okay we're going to translate is real.

647
01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:21.090
Jones, Edward R: Time streaming so the program is listening to you talk of sorry the PLO the program sees you type.

648
01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:29.160
Jones, Edward R: And produces the video and audio stream coming out of that a texture an audio stream coming out of that.

649
01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:31.860
Jones, Edward R: Almost as fast as you can type.

650
01:34:33.150 --> 01:34:41.130
Jones, Edward R: Okay that's a pipe dream right now it's not that fast Okay, but five years 10 years, and now I guarantee it's going to be.

651
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:52.680
Jones, Edward R: they're going to talk right and that's fantastic, can you imagine, no more typing maybe we can just maybe we can just talk to the computer and it'll automatically do things right.

652
01:34:53.340 --> 01:34:55.920
Karis Jochen: Dr Jones do you mind if I ask a question.

653
01:34:56.370 --> 01:34:59.610
Jones, Edward R: Oh charisse welcome I didn't see the first part okay what's up.

654
01:35:00.030 --> 01:35:05.430
Karis Jochen: hi Dr Jones So my question is from a business application.

655
01:35:05.610 --> 01:35:15.960
Karis Jochen: perspective or a bunch of companies and businesses just paying Google using Google cloud pop platform and paying.

656
01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:34.260
Karis Jochen: Google the these fees to use their api's for their various Apps and websites like is this just a thing that is basically i'm asking is is Google running the universe, and we don't even know it.

657
01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:39.900
Jones, Edward R: Oh, I don't know but yeah I mean I think that's pretty obvious right so.

658
01:35:42.150 --> 01:35:57.360
Jones, Edward R: Google Google has access to a lot but yes, this is all I think this is part of their their corporate strategy is to get people to use these APIs embed them and some of the upcoming technology like autonomous vehicles navigation systems.

659
01:35:58.740 --> 01:36:14.310
Jones, Edward R: alexa you know all of these different applications were the sort of thing they are embedding this software in those applications and then Google gets a small fraction of that and a fraction of a small fraction of a whole lot of stuff is a lot of money so.

660
01:36:14.670 --> 01:36:14.940
Jones, Edward R: I think.

661
01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:15.990
Jones, Edward R: we're doing it.

662
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:26.820
Karis Jochen: apple using first year first year first theory, for example, are they using google's API as well, or do they have their.

663
01:36:26.820 --> 01:36:30.870
Jones, Edward R: own I suspect they have their own but I don't know they're not friendly.

664
01:36:31.410 --> 01:36:31.890
With one.

665
01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:43.590
Jones, Edward R: Another when I when I hear the news, and I don't know what i'm hearing, but what I hear in the news is that they're there they look at each other as competitors, especially in this area.

666
01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:48.300
Jones, Edward R: There was a new news out just the last few days, talking about.

667
01:36:49.530 --> 01:36:53.790
Jones, Edward R: The iPhone 15 or 13 yes 13 I think it is.

668
01:36:54.330 --> 01:36:59.280
Jones, Edward R: And they were saying that the iPhone 13 is going to be a problem for Facebook, because they don't.

669
01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:01.860
Jones, Edward R: And Google, because they removed.

670
01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:14.100
Jones, Edward R: The ability to actually access those Apps which is not but i'm not happy about, because I use the Google APP whole time but at any rate don't worry we'll worry about it later.

671
01:37:15.630 --> 01:37:29.070
Jones, Edward R: I think there's an issue here, I don't know how this is all going to work out a government wise, but at some point something's going to come to a head part of the problem here is, this is not a US corporation anymore it's an international Corporation.

672
01:37:30.330 --> 01:37:39.240
Jones, Edward R: That, in fact, they are right, so if the United States is like what they're doing well, I just go set up shop in Jamaica or wherever they want to go to.

673
01:37:40.770 --> 01:37:50.340
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so politics that's enough all right week for text to speech just continue ahead alright, the first thing you need to do is you need to install some stuff.

674
01:37:51.120 --> 01:38:04.020
Jones, Edward R: So kinda install does not work on this, but the good news is the pip works, just like a champ so i'd like you to go and open up spider right now, if you could, and if you haven't already done this do it.

675
01:38:05.070 --> 01:38:18.540
Jones, Edward R: The first thing to do is install text to speech, and you can see the the code here pip install Google dash cloud that's not a period that's a dash Google dash cloud dex dash.

676
01:38:18.990 --> 01:38:32.700
Jones, Edward R: text to speech all one word which is pretty ugly text to speech is one word is like really I thought we should have put a period in there, or something it is looks ugly but somebody in Google decided that was okay.

677
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:42.780
Jones, Edward R: So that's how you install the text to speech API in spider in anaconda now after you do the pip install.

678
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:56.700
Jones, Edward R: You want to restart your kernel now I hope you know how to do that in spider in spider you, you can go up to I think it's console and you can say.

679
01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:07.560
Jones, Edward R: restart the kernel and basically it's a harmless thing and basically restarts Python and so when you install something like this, you do need to restart Python.

680
01:39:07.980 --> 01:39:28.500
Jones, Edward R: For that, so that spider and anaconda recognize that it's there it now is in the list of Apps that are loaded on your computer and, if you want to verify that you can type in conduct list kinda list, and you will see that it says in that list Google cloud text to speech.

681
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:40.200
Jones, Edward R: Now, once installed, you can use the import statements that you see here important Google dot out a u Th and that's used before with translate.

682
01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:59.580
Jones, Edward R: that's the package in Google cloud that we use to authenticate that we are a register user so that's the part that gets us to our credentials and it gets Google to recognize our credentials and then then recognize us as a authorized user somebody that can build.

683
01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:08.400
Jones, Edward R: And from Google cloud import text to speech that is critical, because that's what we're going to be using here in just a minute.

684
01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:21.420
Jones, Edward R: And now, if you go into week number four, there is a folder called lecture files and in lecture files you're going to find a Python program open this up.

685
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:31.890
Jones, Edward R: download it from the week for lecture files folder this file is called local dash text dash to dash speech that P, why.

686
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:40.980
Jones, Edward R: And you want to download this and put this into your the area that you have your other Python programs running and open this up with spider.

687
01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:53.640
Jones, Edward R: Because now we're going to talk about this program what is it doing this is the basic program that's going to talk about how do you take text and make it into speech in the using this API.

688
01:40:55.020 --> 01:41:00.780
Jones, Edward R: All right, i'm going to move move ahead, assuming that this has been done and you're or you're in the process of doing it.

689
01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.050
Karen Fireman: If you don't see that file.

690
01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:10.650
Karen Fireman: one set of text to speech play which one is in text to speech, respect text to speech sport and play.

691
01:41:11.610 --> 01:41:12.240
Local.

692
01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:15.480
Jones, Edward R: text, it should say local touch to speech.

693
01:41:15.570 --> 01:41:21.810
Karen Fireman: It doesn't say local there's text to speech P, why there's text to speech play poi and speech to text P, why.

694
01:41:22.230 --> 01:41:22.560
Okay.

695
01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:25.110
Jones, Edward R: Let me take a look at that.

696
01:41:26.670 --> 01:41:29.340
Jones, Edward R: It so i'm gonna i'm gonna back out of this just for a second.

697
01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:35.400
Jones, Edward R: it's a man, I hope I didn't make a mistake on the upload part, but I could have let me check.

698
01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:36.600
Karen Fireman: Maybe on this.

699
01:41:37.710 --> 01:41:40.440
Jones, Edward R: None of this happens with me.

700
01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:49.770
Jones, Edward R: I have this was a so i'm going here to the week for lecture files area and now i'm looking I don't see the local part.

701
01:41:51.510 --> 01:42:00.960
Jones, Edward R: So I see text to speech and said, let me take a look at the first one here and and tell you whether or not I can tell you them, whether or not this is the local.

702
01:42:02.730 --> 01:42:04.110
Jones, Edward R: Keep yes, sir.

703
01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:10.140
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

704
01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:12.900
Jones, Edward R: open.

705
01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:18.930
Jones, Edward R: Make it bigger, so I could read it.

706
01:42:22.530 --> 01:42:23.670
Jones, Edward R: Now this is not it.

707
01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:37.890
Jones, Edward R: Okay, I need, I think i'm going to need to upload to the Syria, let me just take a detour real quick and i'm going to go to upload build content file.

708
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:45.540
Jones, Edward R: And the file here will be I hope it's I have it well, let me browse my computer make sure I have it.

709
01:42:51.630 --> 01:42:52.290
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

710
01:42:54.990 --> 01:42:55.680
Jones, Edward R: yeah.

711
01:42:57.240 --> 01:42:59.520
Jones, Edward R: Yes, I have it, thank God okay.

712
01:43:03.690 --> 01:43:05.550
Jones, Edward R: Karen, thank you for that question.

713
01:43:06.450 --> 01:43:07.740
Karen Fireman: Thank you, Sir, I really appreciate.

714
01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:08.130
Jones, Edward R: You.

715
01:43:08.190 --> 01:43:13.830
Jones, Edward R: I was getting ready to go go off and do you oh yeah it's not even there okay.

716
01:43:14.850 --> 01:43:16.560
Jones, Edward R: Local dash text.

717
01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:22.200
Jones, Edward R: To speech.

718
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:25.230
Jones, Edward R: But the why.

719
01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:30.210
Jones, Edward R: And I should be able, just to upload this now.

720
01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:41.280
Jones, Edward R: And you'll be should be able to as well where's the submit button oh it's over over behind all these pictures this beautiful people okay there we go.

721
01:43:42.630 --> 01:43:49.170
Jones, Edward R: it's there Okay, so, if you look at the bottom where yeah that's okay.

722
01:43:49.770 --> 01:43:51.360
Karen Fireman: there's a local one now Okay, let me.

723
01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:57.630
Jones, Edward R: yeah so you should see if you go to the week for folder lecture files, you should see a file now.

724
01:43:57.660 --> 01:43:58.740
Karen Fireman: Yes, yes.

725
01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:01.350
Jones, Edward R: local settings of speech Okay, thank you.

726
01:44:02.490 --> 01:44:10.170
Jones, Edward R: Because yeah that would be bad a bad if i'm here I am talking about this fall and you don't have it so let's see.

727
01:44:11.190 --> 01:44:19.230
Jones, Edward R: Hopefully that's the only glitch here Okay, so please open up that file and, if you would go to the top of the file.

728
01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:24.810
Jones, Edward R: And i'm going to restart the slideshow So you can see, this a little better.

729
01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.510
Jones, Edward R: There we go okay good.

730
01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:36.000
Jones, Edward R: Alright, so um slide number 53 in case you're wondering.

731
01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:50.730
Jones, Edward R: slide number 53 alright, so this is the text to speech, and I would like to point out there only to import statements here, and these are the two that I mentioned earlier.

732
01:44:51.420 --> 01:45:05.400
Jones, Edward R: That you need you need the ot ap import a u Th in order to get your credentials recognized and you need the text to speech important in order to where we're going to do, which is changed text into.

733
01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:24.030
Jones, Edward R: speech file, so I have a function here called text to wave, and the reason for that is we're going to take a text file and and we're going to produce a wav file w AV a wav file is a particular type of audio recording.

734
01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:35.310
Jones, Edward R: This is old school stuff and the beginning there were there was wave, and it was good, and it was found mostly on windows machines.

735
01:45:36.690 --> 01:45:44.130
Jones, Edward R: And then came was it quick time quick, whatever the MAC the MAC thing was a quick thing.

736
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:47.400
Jones, Edward R: Quick thing something, and it was good.

737
01:45:47.940 --> 01:45:50.040
Jones, Edward R: And then came MP3 and it was better.

738
01:45:50.610 --> 01:45:56.490
Jones, Edward R: Right, where it goes back a while, but let me unfortunately or fortunately.

739
01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:15.870
Jones, Edward R: You don't have much of a choice here it's going to produce a wav file because it's it's looking for efficiency, this is a model file not stereo so this file is being encoded wave model mono channel one channel.

740
01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:31.110
Jones, Edward R: APP what's called 1600 hertz which is not high quality, if you were doing music, you would record this is probably stereo MP3 at 48,000 hertz.

741
01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:47.670
Jones, Edward R: Okay, but what do we invoice we don't need the have the recording done the way you would say do a violin concerto or something like that so we're going to produce a smaller file a wav file, which is like I say it's not stereo.

742
01:46:49.020 --> 01:47:00.300
Jones, Edward R: So you can see the function here it's called text to wave and you look at their 1234 parameters that are coming into this function.

743
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:10.830
Jones, Edward R: One of the parameters is required, which is the first one, it says text input notice the other parameters have an equal equal sign to them.

744
01:47:11.310 --> 01:47:21.300
Jones, Edward R: When you have a parameter, this is equal, that is, the default for that parameter, and also that parameter than is not required when you call that function.

745
01:47:22.110 --> 01:47:38.760
Jones, Edward R: So the first parameter is required, the other three are optional if they are not given, then they assume the values that you see in the description of these these three this you see here, for example, type if you don't give a value there it's going to be file.

746
01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:43.170
Jones, Edward R: The other value for type is string.

747
01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:48.360
Jones, Edward R: The input here can be either a file name or just a string.

748
01:47:50.010 --> 01:47:51.060
Jones, Edward R: Which is really cool.

749
01:47:52.170 --> 01:48:04.140
Jones, Edward R: Because I other words I can take what you're typing and turn it into an audio recording a string or, if you have something that's been saved off, I can take that and put that into an audio recording.

750
01:48:06.150 --> 01:48:06.600
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

751
01:48:09.090 --> 01:48:19.440
Jones, Edward R: So the first input is text input that can be either a file name or just text string the next one is type the word type.

752
01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:33.840
Jones, Edward R: Which by default is file so by default this thing expects a file it's coming in, but if you change the type to string, then it will look at that first term text input as a string instead of a filename.

753
01:48:34.770 --> 01:48:43.050
Jones, Edward R: Language the default language of English right, but you can make that language, the the text would be in Spanish.

754
01:48:44.130 --> 01:48:50.160
Jones, Edward R: French you know those are all possibilities Chinese is possible with the in Arabic is a possibility.

755
01:48:52.290 --> 01:49:12.690
Jones, Edward R: And then your speech file, which is the last parameter there, this is the name of the wav file that is going to be created and by default will put the trends, the recording in a file called speech dash file dot wave and they will put that in the same directory as your code.

756
01:49:13.740 --> 01:49:28.800
Jones, Edward R: So if you want that file to go somewhere else, with a different name, possibly you want to put speech file equal to, and then give it the industry as as a string the path, and then the file name, where that thing is going OK now you don't have to.

757
01:49:29.850 --> 01:49:38.850
Jones, Edward R: give it a name and it's just going to go there and this speeds up, you can say temp that way of as a temporary let you know that this is just a temporary recording or something like that.

758
01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:51.750
Jones, Edward R: let's go back and look at the code, then so in the very top of the code after you enter those things it looks at the word type it says, this is a type of file.

759
01:49:52.290 --> 01:49:59.760
Jones, Edward R: If it is a file let's try to open it now look at this Python character, look at this Python structure here, this should be familiar to you.

760
01:50:00.570 --> 01:50:11.700
Jones, Edward R: This structures is always used if you're going to do an operation that could crash the program put it in what's called a try except structure or box.

761
01:50:12.210 --> 01:50:23.250
Jones, Edward R: So I you inside the code you put the code that might crash Why would it crash bad file name, you know you're you don't have privileges to write to that location.

762
01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:33.870
Jones, Edward R: Okay, there are all sorts of reasons why writing a pilot and crash you don't want to you don't want to have it destroy your program your beautiful program just because they entered a bad.

763
01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:49.920
Jones, Edward R: name for the vial so you you try to open it in good faith, but if it does crash, then it instead of giving you a route error message and executes the code in the accept block.

764
01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:59.430
Jones, Edward R: So it says, except exception, as he exception is the error message, except put the error message in a variable called he.

765
01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:02.190
Jones, Edward R: I may or may not want to read it.

766
01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:13.050
Jones, Edward R: But i'm going to tell you right here, the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to print out in the window unable to open and give it the name of the file chances are is misspelled.

767
01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:18.870
Jones, Edward R: Now here we're here we're actually reading the file you'll see you at the top, it says.

768
01:51:19.950 --> 01:51:35.370
Jones, Edward R: Read, this is a read statement so we're reading the file using the text name that was passed into this function and we're going to read the file and put the content, so that put the whatever's in the file, which is a string into a variable called contents.

769
01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:43.500
Jones, Edward R: Now, this can crash if it crashes, we come down here, we say unable to open and we give it loops we give it the name of the file.

770
01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:54.360
Jones, Edward R: And, and then i'm actually here, I decided I should go ahead and print the error message that's coming from Python and then the return just says get out of here.

771
01:51:55.050 --> 01:52:02.160
Jones, Edward R: we're done this we're not gonna be able to do anything if I can't read that file return means get me out of this function go back to where it was.

772
01:52:04.590 --> 01:52:23.580
Jones, Edward R: So that's if you have a file now if you if you also then having just bought her having open that file, I want to check the size of the file to see if it's greater than 5000 characters if it's greater than 5000 characters it's going to crash.

773
01:52:24.750 --> 01:52:31.890
Jones, Edward R: The Google API does not allow you that that's the quota remember I said, their quotas on these things, one of the quotas.

774
01:52:32.250 --> 01:52:40.560
Jones, Edward R: On the text to speech API is that if you're doing a local file, they can not have more than 5000 characters which actually is pretty small okay.

775
01:52:41.550 --> 01:52:52.110
Jones, Edward R: So it's this thing is designed for small communications at the local level Now you can go to if they are if it is larger than 5000.

776
01:52:53.070 --> 01:53:02.430
Jones, Edward R: There are ways that the you can use of cloud team to handle that So if you you check the check to see if the side, this is greater than 5000 if it is.

777
01:53:02.970 --> 01:53:15.420
Jones, Edward R: Tell about talk about an error local file to large local text files are limited to no more than 5000 characters this file contains and then give it the number of characters that are actually in the file, so the book person knows oh.

778
01:53:16.170 --> 01:53:26.070
Jones, Edward R: yeah 6000 okay I just take a few more you know day I will feel as or something like that, on the other hand, if it's 5 million well okay this, this is the wrong Program.

779
01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:38.640
Jones, Edward R: And then, if you pass all of this, and so, by all of this, I mean we read the file and we check the con the size of the file, then we pass in the credentials.

780
01:53:39.630 --> 01:53:45.810
Jones, Edward R: Then we pass on the credentials we're ready to ready, we got the we got the contents we're ready to start working on this, all right.

781
01:53:46.620 --> 01:54:07.080
Jones, Edward R: You after you pass in the conventions you actually send the contents over to the text to speech API and the you just basically you see it says synthesis input is equal to all right synthesis is the jargon that's using this API to refer to the voice recording.

782
01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:19.320
Jones, Edward R: So there's synthesizing and artificial voice recording well artificial voice in a recording so you'll see the word synthesis or synthetic.

783
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:32.190
Jones, Edward R: Is several places in the API that's just fancy word for recording the voice should computer generated recording all right, and then it says set the voice for the speech.

784
01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:35.190
Jones, Edward R: Now this is way cool all right.

785
01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:50.550
Jones, Edward R: They have maybe 100 different voices that you can use for each language, like the English language, there are probably there's probably for the English language I would guesstimate something like 20 or 30 voices.

786
01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:59.940
Jones, Edward R: what's the difference well somebody from the north somebody from the South is the accent half of them are male half of our female.

787
01:55:01.050 --> 01:55:11.640
Jones, Edward R: Some of the voices sound kind of young, some of them some kind of older, some of them sound excited and some of them, not so much so, you get to choose the voice here.

788
01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:26.400
Jones, Edward R: which can influence power these recordings sounds not only can you can choose let's say the language so you can specify the language of the native language of the speaker Now this is funny.

789
01:55:27.300 --> 01:55:34.230
Jones, Edward R: Because I can write a program here, where the native language, the speakers, Spanish and they're reading English.

790
01:55:35.550 --> 01:55:38.400
Jones, Edward R: Okay yeah I did on it it's kind of weird.

791
01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:48.120
Jones, Edward R: Are you going to have the native language is Chinese and they're going to read English and see how this goes right so it's kind of fun to play with.

792
01:55:48.750 --> 01:56:03.990
Jones, Edward R: But that that is what you're doing here you're you're setting up the voice the native voice of the speaker, not the translation, not the language that's in the text file you're talking about the speaker here.

793
01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:16.410
Jones, Edward R: And notice that I checked to see whether the the language is in the language keys is this language support it and if it's not I just say i'm supported language we're out of here.

794
01:56:17.730 --> 01:56:26.040
Jones, Edward R: So we do, there are, if you look at the documentation on this API there must be 100 or more of these voices.

795
01:56:26.550 --> 01:56:41.640
Jones, Edward R: and different languages and the main languages, you do see, but there are some obvious holes like Farsi, for example, is big Hall, but you do have Arabic and some other things, but I don't think navajos in there it's.

796
01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:53.940
Jones, Edward R: And then you say Okay, the configuration of the the text to speech to speech to the audio configuration.

797
01:56:54.390 --> 01:57:15.540
Jones, Edward R: The configuration of the output file and the one that seems to be accepted, mostly here is a w AV Mano 16,000 hertz and in order to get that you just use this code right here, and the phrase word linear 16 which refers to wave 16,000 hertz model.

798
01:57:16.590 --> 01:57:19.440
Jones, Edward R: You can also use I think there's another term fly EU.

799
01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:30.420
Jones, Edward R: And that'll do the same thing, and now you can produce MP3 files and other types of audio configuration.

800
01:57:31.290 --> 01:57:41.400
Jones, Edward R: Hopefully you don't have to go there now, the reason I would discourage That is because of the other API that speech to text will only take a wav file.

801
01:57:42.150 --> 01:57:53.010
Jones, Edward R: So he went versus if you have an MP3 file and now you want to go back to text, good luck, you need to convert that ap that MP3 to wav file before you do that.

802
01:57:54.240 --> 01:58:04.020
Jones, Edward R: Okay uh and then, so this is describing the output file structure is a wav file and then this is the, this is the code.

803
01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:19.110
Jones, Edward R: That does the lifting convert speech to text response is equal to client that synthesize speech all right, create this request synthetic voicera and the input is going to be synthesis input.

804
01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:33.690
Jones, Edward R: We we did that, at the top very first line synthesis input, the voice oh yeah yeah that's right up here it's going to be a guy and this the English language speaking guy and.

805
01:58:35.550 --> 01:58:37.800
Jones, Edward R: The audio is going to be wave.

806
01:58:39.060 --> 01:58:39.450
Okay.

807
01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:59.970
Jones, Edward R: So that produces the file and then the next set of code down here writes that file into the the location described by speech file if you don't include that in your entry it'll go to speech file wave in the same the local directory.

808
01:59:02.610 --> 01:59:08.910
Jones, Edward R: Okay, and all right now, if you haven't done this yet run this file in spider.

809
01:59:09.690 --> 01:59:24.660
Karen Fireman: Man, I had a problem I saw the fix them 43 that people said but it's still it needed this wave thing and I didn't maybe I didn't put it in the right place, I didn't know how to move the wav file, because when I tried to download and it just opened and and your voice came out.

810
01:59:26.370 --> 01:59:28.260
Jones, Edward R: Okay well that's cool that.

811
01:59:28.650 --> 01:59:29.940
Karen Fireman: is cool it was you, but.

812
01:59:30.030 --> 01:59:31.140
Jones, Edward R: It doesn't sound okay.

813
01:59:31.650 --> 01:59:33.090
Karen Fireman: it's not a great it was only a few.

814
01:59:33.090 --> 01:59:33.780
Jones, Edward R: seconds, but I.

815
01:59:34.290 --> 01:59:35.160
Karen Fireman: Save that file.

816
01:59:35.310 --> 01:59:41.040
Jones, Edward R: If you look in the folder for week four it says lecture files, you should see these recordings.

817
01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:44.070
Karen Fireman: I saw it, but when I tried to download it I didn't know how to do it.

818
01:59:44.970 --> 01:59:45.300
Oh.

819
01:59:46.410 --> 01:59:48.810
Jones, Edward R: You should just click on it, it comes down to your download folder.

820
01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:51.660
Karen Fireman: It didn't when I clicked on it and open it and then talk to me.

821
01:59:52.500 --> 01:59:54.960
Jones, Edward R: Oh well, this is the APP lets you save it.

822
01:59:55.860 --> 01:59:59.190
Clay Coleman: Well yeah yeah there's three dots on the side you.

823
01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:01.050
Clay Coleman: click on the three dots and it says download.

824
02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:03.120
Karen Fireman: Oh, thank you, sorry.

825
02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:05.100
Karen Fireman: Thank you for.

826
02:00:05.460 --> 02:00:10.080
Jim Clark: The first time I tried to do, I had the same problem and, finally, I had to did.

827
02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:11.250
Jones, Edward R: you hear me talking to him.

828
02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:12.660
Jim Clark: Oh yes, right but.

829
02:00:12.720 --> 02:00:22.020
Jim Clark: This is good, well download your data, but once you actually had to give it a pass name that you recognize it so we go right folder.

830
02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:24.270
Jones, Edward R: i'm good.

831
02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:29.460
Jim Clark: But with I ran the program and I could say I ran all the way to.

832
02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:35.310
Jim Clark: detect Paul revere and there there's an there's a character problem so.

833
02:00:37.350 --> 02:00:43.890
Jones, Edward R: Look, let me go through the test cases, the first test case should use a recording called sin.

834
02:00:44.550 --> 02:00:45.600
Karen Fireman: it's wrong.

835
02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:47.880
Karen Fireman: it's spelled hallo instead of Hello.

836
02:00:50.250 --> 02:00:56.670
Jones, Edward R: yeah that's right, it should spell be spelled like that okay that's German.

837
02:00:56.880 --> 02:00:58.530
Karen Fireman: Where are you putting Hello.

838
02:00:59.100 --> 02:01:02.610
Jones, Edward R: Because i'll snow hang on hang on there are several recordings here.

839
02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:05.340
Jones, Edward R: As some of the recordings are not an English.

840
02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:08.760
Jones, Edward R: Okay, this particular recording.

841
02:01:08.790 --> 02:01:09.900
Jones, Edward R: That you're seeing here.

842
02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:11.760
Karen Fireman: I get it to stop.

843
02:01:12.990 --> 02:01:13.410
Karen Fireman: What.

844
02:01:15.390 --> 02:01:17.340
Karen Fireman: This one says still recording.

845
02:01:19.530 --> 02:01:20.160
Jones, Edward R: it's still.

846
02:01:21.870 --> 02:01:22.350
Jones, Edward R: Not a lot.

847
02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:35.040
Jones, Edward R: This program should read that file sin dash alo that wave and the files should say hello, do you speak German.

848
02:01:36.660 --> 02:01:38.730
Jones, Edward R: The word Hello in German is all.

849
02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:42.990
Jones, Edward R: Okay, and I do speak German, some.

850
02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:53.010
Jones, Edward R: So you would type, if you read that file, this is the way this is the way you would do it well actually no i'm sorry.

851
02:01:54.540 --> 02:02:17.010
Jones, Edward R: This this first test case i'm sending a string hello, do you speak German, and the type here is string instead of file and then the output file is going to be it's going to be sent to audio sin underscore Oh, it was like a move to head.

852
02:02:19.290 --> 02:02:21.660
Jones, Edward R: Right, there are loaded with.

853
02:02:22.830 --> 02:02:31.950
Jones, Edward R: So that you'll see this should be the first test case and what you should only see in your output window, it says audio content written to file audio.

854
02:02:33.270 --> 02:02:48.000
Jones, Edward R: What I did was I created a directory in my in the area where I have my Python code and that directory is called audio and so it's writing into the directory called audio and it's writing that's the name of the file it's going to write.

855
02:02:49.740 --> 02:03:06.360
Jones, Edward R: And this, this is not me in the recording because this is being this is completely synthetic i'm sending it a string and then it's decoding that string that's an English speaker I think yeah it's an English speaker and.

856
02:03:08.220 --> 02:03:14.700
Jones, Edward R: yeah, and so this should just come out hello, do you speak German and that's what you should hear in this file.

857
02:03:16.290 --> 02:03:16.770
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

858
02:03:18.270 --> 02:03:35.250
Jones, Edward R: The next test case is it's a similar thing except the Spanish I blow out, you know all our blessing lists and it's just another string and this one will come out into this recording you see here, and you can see that.

859
02:03:38.310 --> 02:03:45.570
Jones, Edward R: And then, this is the case where you have a file, so this would be a text file.

860
02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:48.360
Jones, Edward R: loaded text.

861
02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:58.950
Jones, Edward R: And the language here is Spanish this text files, this is it has a Spanish text in it, and then the speech file will be sent to here.

862
02:04:01.140 --> 02:04:08.850
Jones, Edward R: And Okay, so that is basically all there is to text to speech.

863
02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:15.030
Jones, Edward R: At I haven't covered i've only covered the local small files.

864
02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:35.790
Jones, Edward R: Small strings less than 2000 characters on the string or the file has to have less than 2000 characters now what would you do if you had a pilot say that it had a million character sign well the obvious easiest approach is to is to do chunks you know look for 2000 character chunks.

865
02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:39.960
Jones, Edward R: record each one of those and then put them together.

866
02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:48.510
Jones, Edward R: But for our purposes, this is the limit as far as i'm going through the documentation on how to make this.

867
02:04:49.980 --> 02:05:01.410
Jones, Edward R: Larger how to handle larger cases or the text files larger I think my inclination we first to call Google to see if they can raise the quota if you don't like the quota.

868
02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:14.640
Jones, Edward R: And then the our case the quote it says to no more than 2000 characters So if you want to do a larger files in 2000 characters the easiest thing to do is to call up Google and there is a number.

869
02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:25.200
Jones, Edward R: If you look at the quote is there is a good information on the on the dashboard there's a phone number, you can call, and you can tell them they're going to want to know.

870
02:05:25.650 --> 02:05:35.040
Jones, Edward R: Why are you doing this and blah blah blah, and then they can raise those photos on an individual case basis, so if you're let's say doing this.

871
02:05:36.390 --> 02:05:45.120
Jones, Edward R: For court, you know judicial court and you wanted to be able to produce recordings for people that say that might be blind.

872
02:05:45.960 --> 02:06:03.510
Jones, Edward R: So you have a witness coming in and they're blind and they can't read the text right, but you would like to have a unbiased synthetic recording of what that text is saying this is one way to do it, but you may want to lift the quota from 2000 characters to so you know, whatever the number.

873
02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:06.960
Jones, Edward R: You actually need, and I think Google will be warm to that.

874
02:06:08.130 --> 02:06:22.680
Jones, Edward R: Either they are, they are other approaches another approach would be to put the text on the Google cloud and to use different part of the API which is not documented, so they would give you that documentation.

875
02:06:23.580 --> 02:06:24.630
Swanson J, Charles Richard: Dr Jones.

876
02:06:24.870 --> 02:06:25.380
Yes, ma'am.

877
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:28.410
Jones, Edward R: No ma'am who's talking.

878
02:06:28.590 --> 02:06:29.370
Swanson J, Charles Richard: And this is Charles.

879
02:06:30.630 --> 02:06:36.150
Swanson J, Charles Richard: Before we move on on line 43 for the windows users.

880
02:06:36.660 --> 02:06:46.440
Jones, Edward R: Okay, hang on, let me go back, let me back up, so I can see where we're talking here line 43 okay yeah right here, the open part right the sky.

881
02:06:46.710 --> 02:06:50.370
Swanson J, Charles Richard: Yes, Sir i'm right after the are.

882
02:06:51.660 --> 02:06:59.220
Swanson J, Charles Richard: Pretty narrow comma then encoding equals left quote you tf dash a right quote.

883
02:07:01.050 --> 02:07:04.200
Swanson J, Charles Richard: will help eliminate a.

884
02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:10.950
Swanson J, Charles Richard: character nap nap decoding error error.

885
02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:13.260
Jones, Edward R: You get into encoding there so.

886
02:07:13.770 --> 02:07:15.270
Jones, Edward R: Basically, right here.

887
02:07:15.570 --> 02:07:23.250
Jones, Edward R: After this, you put a comma, and then you put in coding equal to, and then in quotes ut F dash a.

888
02:07:23.640 --> 02:07:24.120
Swanson J, Charles Richard: Yes, sir.

889
02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:34.440
Jones, Edward R: yeah we've seen that before it's a weird thing because all text files 99% of for you to faith, so what you know it's kind of crazy.

890
02:07:36.420 --> 02:07:50.550
Jones, Edward R: right but that's a good catch girls, so those of you that are in windows if you're given an error at line number 5043 approximately right in this area of the code right here after they are quote.

891
02:07:51.060 --> 02:08:04.170
Jones, Edward R: Put a comma, and then the word encoding equals and then in quotes you T F dash eight uniform tango foxtrot dash eight okay.

892
02:08:04.680 --> 02:08:08.790
Swanson J, Charles Richard: And and actually that plays Arabic identify defects.

893
02:08:10.290 --> 02:08:10.950
Jones, Edward R: With clay.

894
02:08:11.370 --> 02:08:11.910
Swanson J, Charles Richard: Yes, sir.

895
02:08:12.300 --> 02:08:14.190
Jones, Edward R: Okay, thanks Lee.

896
02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:16.410
Jones, Edward R: All right.

897
02:08:17.850 --> 02:08:24.030
Jones, Edward R: i'm so happy everybody calling on things like that this is great, and I need to change the code to obviously.

898
02:08:26.910 --> 02:08:33.120
Jones, Edward R: Now there is another program and instead of local text to speech is called text to speech play.

899
02:08:34.380 --> 02:08:44.700
Jones, Edward R: And that one you want to take a look at because what's in there is not only does it translate this to a wav file it reads the file as well.

900
02:08:45.750 --> 02:08:55.590
Jones, Edward R: Now, in order to make that happen, you have to i'm using a special package for that there are lots of ways to read wav files in Python.

901
02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:10.200
Jones, Edward R: The one that's supposed to talk about is I think it's called sound, something the one that's most talked about is obsolete that doesn't work for hasn't worked for the last year or two, so the one that i'm using is.

902
02:09:12.300 --> 02:09:19.110
Jones, Edward R: Let me, let me get out of here and go over here to spider and.

903
02:09:22.140 --> 02:09:32.070
Jones, Edward R: yeah if you go to text to speech or you go to text to speech play I think those two, by the way, are the same.

904
02:09:33.210 --> 02:09:40.230
Jones, Edward R: programs you'll see there's an import statement here that's called simple audio as SA.

905
02:09:40.860 --> 02:09:54.600
Jones, Edward R: So this is another package that you need to if you're going to play the audio part in your program you need to install simple audio and you can do that by just going pip install simple audio.

906
02:09:55.470 --> 02:10:02.280
Jones, Edward R: That will install it restart the kernel and then you can use, you can run this program.

907
02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:21.540
Jones, Edward R: text to speech or text to speech dash play, both of them, I think, do the same thing and it's actually going to read what it does convert for you real time, so let me run this on my computer I haven't done this before cross my fingers Okay, here we go.

908
02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:32.070
Jones, Edward R: So the first to the play was activated.

909
02:10:34.470 --> 02:10:41.940
Jones, Edward R: And so you heard you heard that voice that was a computer voice that was a male computer male.

910
02:10:43.380 --> 02:10:50.820
Jones, Edward R: It could be English computer mail right So if you run run these programs, you will hear them that playing of.

911
02:10:56.820 --> 02:11:03.990
Jones, Edward R: So the first speaker was an English speaking voice the second one was the Spanish speaking voice mail.

912
02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:17.880
Jones, Edward R: Now you can go on the API and actually listen to these different voices and choose the voice that you want, if you look at this code, a little bit further down.

913
02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:28.260
Jones, Edward R: let's see here, you see the languages are listed, this is a dictionary, so I have English, Spanish, German Chinese and Arabic, you can add to this.

914
02:11:28.830 --> 02:11:43.680
Jones, Edward R: And then, what you see here in the is first of all, the sixth it was called a 630 is oh 639 code for the language, English is een dash us Spanish, yes, that she is German and so forth.

915
02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:58.590
Jones, Edward R: And then over here, this is the name of the voice that's being used, so the English voice is Ian us this is a way of matt with net voice dash D, as in Delta.

916
02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:13.590
Jones, Edward R: And if you look up the voice you'll see that this is supposed to be a male voice, and you can hear a little recording on the on the documentation for this, if you look go to the dashboard and you look at the documentation on text.

917
02:12:14.700 --> 02:12:15.450
Jones, Edward R: To speech.

918
02:12:16.530 --> 02:12:27.630
Jones, Edward R: By changing this information you change the voice, you can, for example, get it make it a female voice, you can change it to a lower voice or higher voice and so forth, and so on.

919
02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:33.210
Jones, Edward R: This information comes up is used.

920
02:12:36.420 --> 02:12:37.140
Jones, Edward R: let's see.

921
02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:41.610
Jones, Edward R: down here.

922
02:12:44.850 --> 02:12:45.510
Jones, Edward R: voice.

923
02:12:46.710 --> 02:12:56.910
Jones, Edward R: You see, it says language zero that should that's the language code and then it says here s s ml gender text to speech.

924
02:12:57.330 --> 02:13:08.100
Jones, Edward R: And it's giving you the name the name of the language here, this is also the voice actually and then this is the gender right here, so this is a defining the characteristics of the voice.

925
02:13:08.730 --> 02:13:17.220
Jones, Edward R: And for me, listening to those voices they sound a whole lot better than a lot of people on TV, I can understand them pretty well.

926
02:13:18.090 --> 02:13:26.850
Jones, Edward R: But you can check it, you know of course that was my I selected the voice based upon what I thought was understanding and I can understand them, but it's you may prefer a different voice.

927
02:13:28.140 --> 02:13:31.290
Jones, Edward R: depending upon your audience or so forth, and so on.

928
02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:42.570
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so I thought that was pretty cool that you can actually generate voices after the speech file is is so developed.

929
02:13:44.610 --> 02:13:45.480
Jones, Edward R: Okay, let me.

930
02:13:47.070 --> 02:13:49.110
Jones, Edward R: move on ahead here and.

931
02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:51.570
Jones, Edward R: Go to.

932
02:13:52.770 --> 02:13:56.160
Jones, Edward R: The next one, which is speech to text.

933
02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:02.130
Jones, Edward R: This is reversing we're going to reverse the coin so.

934
02:14:02.190 --> 02:14:14.580
Karen Fireman: Does anybody know that one work what it did we get that one to work that I mean you went through that speech one like in about three seconds sorry to say, the other one you really went through it, I did we did we run it did it work.

935
02:14:15.990 --> 02:14:16.650
Jones, Edward R: Did I get which.

936
02:14:16.710 --> 02:14:21.180
Karen Fireman: We have a special folder or does it just have to be in the audio folder are.

937
02:14:22.350 --> 02:14:24.000
Jones, Edward R: You, what are we talking about.

938
02:14:24.450 --> 02:14:33.840
Karen Fireman: i'm asking you, Dr Jones on this file that you just said text to speech play um what folder does the does the stuff the input file have to be, and is.

939
02:14:34.050 --> 02:14:34.800
Jones, Edward R: All the same.

940
02:14:35.370 --> 02:14:38.640
Jones, Edward R: yeah Let me take, let me take a look at that again.

941
02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:42.720
Karen Fireman: oops.

942
02:14:44.370 --> 02:14:48.360
Jones, Edward R: Let me show you right down here at the bottom, these are the test cases that are being run right here.

943
02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:53.910
Jones, Edward R: OK, now the first two test cases is just there is a string there's no file.

944
02:14:55.620 --> 02:14:59.910
Jones, Edward R: First, the first string says hello, do you speak German, the next one says all buzzing glass right.

945
02:15:00.690 --> 02:15:06.150
Jones, Edward R: And you see the language here be in Spanish, so the person who's speaking this is going to be a Spanish speaker.

946
02:15:06.510 --> 02:15:13.890
Jones, Edward R: If I didn't have them they're going to have some English some English guy trying to say that doesn't sound good and then you have.

947
02:15:14.490 --> 02:15:27.150
Jones, Edward R: The next one here, I have a file and, as you see it says text Hello text alo, these are all files that you can download, I think, from the.

948
02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:40.230
Jones, Edward R: The week for folder now, if you would have to change this information if you put that file in the same directory is your code then you'd have to get rid of the texts slash.

949
02:15:41.880 --> 02:15:54.600
Jones, Edward R: But what I did was I created a directory called texts, and then I put the files in there, and so, then that's why you see a path here that says Okay, looking at the texture agree and find this file called Hello text.

950
02:15:56.220 --> 02:15:56.790
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

951
02:15:57.150 --> 02:15:59.880
Jones, Edward R: And then there's one called Paul revere shorten text is.

952
02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:10.140
Jones, Edward R: The Paul revere right listen my children the usual year there's been a write up call rear right, you know that one it's really cool phone anyway, is it's too long that.

953
02:16:10.710 --> 02:16:15.180
Karen Fireman: It is very long that's the one that wouldn't stop going when when I accidentally pressed.

954
02:16:15.690 --> 02:16:26.010
Jones, Edward R: yeah well, it turns out this thing is 2000 over 3000 characters so I shorten that So the first the first file shorten it should meet the quota.

955
02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:40.980
Jones, Edward R: it's less than 2000 the second one is the phone and you should get an error message I just put that to basically put it there, to show you what happens if you try to read a file that's too large, it didn't work.

956
02:16:43.230 --> 02:16:47.370
Jones, Edward R: So that yeah that's what's going on these test cases are just things that i've added to the.

957
02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:56.670
Jones, Edward R: code at the bottom, to show you how to access the function, the function and to demonstrate what it does and so forth, and so on.

958
02:16:58.410 --> 02:17:07.230
Jones, Edward R: But you can take any text file you want just send it send it through here just make us actually it's 5000 characters is the limit.

959
02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:11.130
Jones, Edward R: 5000 characters on that file.

960
02:17:13.830 --> 02:17:16.140
Jones, Edward R: Okay, let me go now to this one.

961
02:17:17.100 --> 02:17:19.560
Jim Clark: i'm sorry Dr Jones, can I ask a quick question.

962
02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:21.720
Jones, Edward R: Sure who's this this is.

963
02:17:21.870 --> 02:17:23.550
Jim Clark: Just a gym chips.

964
02:17:23.580 --> 02:17:24.000
Jones, Edward R: chips.

965
02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:30.720
Jim Clark: So we're running the file, you were demonstrating was the text to speech underscore play Is that correct.

966
02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:32.580
Jones, Edward R: The what was the gym.

967
02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:39.570
Jim Clark: That the file, you are demonstrating was text to speech play and Python is that is that the correct farming.

968
02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:47.340
Jones, Edward R: I was actually devon's using the running the program called text to speech, no play on it.

969
02:17:47.790 --> 02:17:48.930
Jim Clark: Okay that's.

970
02:17:49.050 --> 02:17:52.080
Jones, Edward R: I think those I think those two files are exactly the same.

971
02:17:52.620 --> 02:18:00.780
Jim Clark: that the reason why I asked the question is i've tried to run it and I was getting messages saying that you need to import simple audio.

972
02:18:01.290 --> 02:18:03.090
Jones, Edward R: As si yes, yes.

973
02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:10.650
Jim Clark: And I tried pip install simple audio and I had error messages, so we can take that offline.

974
02:18:11.130 --> 02:18:12.240
Jones, Edward R: But then cue that.

975
02:18:12.660 --> 02:18:15.810
Jones, Edward R: yeah when I say you tried to install it did you go pip install.

976
02:18:16.290 --> 02:18:16.710
Jim Clark: Yes, sir.

977
02:18:17.370 --> 02:18:24.600
Jim Clark: Okay, so let's table that for tomorrow, but I wanted to let you know that that was something showed up so that's it.

978
02:18:25.410 --> 02:18:33.750
Jones, Edward R: gives you directions run attorney those kind of just said pip install and you know it seemed to work fine simple audio one word.

979
02:18:34.530 --> 02:18:36.270
Karen Fireman: Thank you, Kim did you restart your kernel.

980
02:18:37.740 --> 02:18:38.010
Jim Clark: Now, no.

981
02:18:38.430 --> 02:18:39.030
Jones, Edward R: You have to do.

982
02:18:43.140 --> 02:18:45.660
Jim Clark: That let's let's go forward and i'll i'll check it.

983
02:18:48.630 --> 02:18:51.060
Jones, Edward R: Okay speech to text.

984
02:18:58.710 --> 02:18:59.400
Jones, Edward R: Okay, here we go.

985
02:19:01.950 --> 02:19:02.190
So.

986
02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:09.990
Jones, Edward R: If you click on the dashboard and you click on go to APIs here.

987
02:19:11.250 --> 02:19:19.410
Jones, Edward R: You can you can either do that from the left hand side over here yeah api's or at the in the API box little bottom thing there.

988
02:19:21.540 --> 02:19:22.860
Jones, Edward R: Then you click on library.

989
02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:26.850
Jones, Edward R: And then we search speech to text.

990
02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:35.850
Jones, Edward R: you've already seen this so now the top of the list is cloud speech to text API you want to click on that.

991
02:19:37.620 --> 02:19:39.150
Jones, Edward R: And you want to enable.

992
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:40.680
Karen Fireman: One second Dr Jones.

993
02:19:43.530 --> 02:19:44.820
Karen Fireman: wait till we catch up a little.

994
02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:45.840
What.

995
02:19:46.860 --> 02:19:49.650
Karen Fireman: Can we follow you in this can we can we catch up a little bit here.

996
02:19:51.660 --> 02:19:54.630
Jones, Edward R: i'm sorry i'm having trouble hearing it here.

997
02:19:54.930 --> 02:19:59.400
Karen Fireman: I was just hoping to catch up where you were struggling slide 64.

998
02:20:00.330 --> 02:20:06.450
Karen Fireman: yeah I was just wondering if we were supposed to do what you were doing to go to the cloud speech to text were we supposed to do that.

999
02:20:08.550 --> 02:20:10.050
Jones, Edward R: Now you don't have to do it right now.

1000
02:20:11.340 --> 02:20:16.650
Jones, Edward R: Okay, but yeah yes, you should you should do this if you're going to use your credentials.

1001
02:20:18.900 --> 02:20:22.230
Jones, Edward R: If you're using my credentials it doesn't matter that's already been installed.

1002
02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:27.660
Jones, Edward R: These installations, of the API nothing happens on your machine.

1003
02:20:28.110 --> 02:20:32.130
Karen Fireman: What if it says it's um it failed the action failed when you try to enable it.

1004
02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:36.690
Jones, Edward R: Probably has something to do with the building.

1005
02:20:38.250 --> 02:20:41.760
Jones, Edward R: Okay gotcha that's usually that's usual thing.

1006
02:20:44.010 --> 02:20:56.100
Jones, Edward R: But I don't know I you know I wouldn't have to see it, but right here, it was just what you should see you should see any enable button and, once it is is enabled, then you would see a manage button right here.

1007
02:20:57.480 --> 02:21:00.540
Jones, Edward R: and its meaning when you can disable it if you want.

1008
02:21:01.230 --> 02:21:02.010
Karen Fireman: Okay, thanks.

1009
02:21:02.430 --> 02:21:08.340
Jones, Edward R: yeah and, if you look, if you want to look at the documentation, you can click on documentation here.

1010
02:21:09.450 --> 02:21:19.980
Jones, Edward R: and actually what happens is it just takes you down to the bottom, that says tutorials and it says at the bottom, it says tutorials and documentation.

1011
02:21:20.700 --> 02:21:30.840
Jones, Edward R: So the real documentation is is to click on learn more, and when you click on that, then you get another list of things that you can look at.

1012
02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:36.960
Jones, Edward R: Doc or how to guides basic concepts and so forth.

1013
02:21:40.830 --> 02:21:46.500
Jones, Edward R: Okay, there are many applications and similar to what we were talking about earlier autonomous vehicles and.

1014
02:21:47.580 --> 02:21:49.710
Jones, Edward R: voice instructions and so forth.

1015
02:21:52.560 --> 02:22:00.930
Jones, Edward R: There are basically three different kinds, you can do local files local wave recordings.

1016
02:22:02.310 --> 02:22:11.880
Jones, Edward R: Once again they're going to restrict you if you're using a local file in the previous case we're reusing the local text file now we're using a local wave recording.

1017
02:22:12.630 --> 02:22:30.480
Jones, Edward R: This is restricted by Google to small recordings, which means something that's less than 1.5 megabytes so when you look at the wav recording if it's more than 1.5 megabytes, then you cannot treat it or you cannot use it as a local speech file.

1018
02:22:31.740 --> 02:22:43.470
Jones, Edward R: You have to go to option to larger wav files recordings larger than 1.5 will need to be stored in the cloud and then converted from the cloud.

1019
02:22:45.180 --> 02:22:57.750
Jones, Edward R: So that means that you basically upload the file into the cloud and then your program will access the recording from the cloud instead of accessing it from your hydro.

1020
02:22:59.460 --> 02:23:06.690
Jones, Edward R: In some ways, this is a good thing, because then you don't have to clutter up your hard drive with live large wav files.

1021
02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:23.550
Jones, Edward R: And the amount of storage that you have in the cloud is huge, because it's it's almost unlimited I think for free, they give you several gigabytes of storage, which is way more than we would normally use.

1022
02:23:24.750 --> 02:23:36.930
Jones, Edward R: And then there is a synchronous or real time streaming that you've been used as well, where you people are talking into a microphone and then that's being transmitted a converted to text file a text.

1023
02:23:38.130 --> 02:23:40.530
Jones, Edward R: document as they're talking.

1024
02:23:44.100 --> 02:23:48.270
Jones, Edward R: So you know, once again, you need to go pip install.

1025
02:23:49.560 --> 02:24:03.930
Jones, Edward R: minus minus upgrade Google cloud speech not speech to text you know the previous one, we had text to speech, remember that well whoever did this just said, Google cloud speech that's enough.

1026
02:24:04.890 --> 02:24:15.690
Jones, Edward R: And what you what happens is you actually get the Google cloud speech to text API installed, so you use the pip to make that make that happen.

1027
02:24:16.590 --> 02:24:31.410
Jones, Edward R: And then, once that's done you could just say from Google cloud Google cloud import speech, and this is important than the API that we use with the speech to text text conversions.

1028
02:24:32.670 --> 02:24:37.950
Jones, Edward R: Now, in the week for lecture files folder there is a Python file called speech to text.

1029
02:24:39.060 --> 02:24:42.840
Jones, Edward R: That P, why that file is the file i'd like to open in spider.

1030
02:24:44.070 --> 02:24:52.980
Jones, Edward R: And we're going to let take a look at that and run it and see how that works now i'm going to pause here, because if you haven't already done this, please do install.

1031
02:24:53.460 --> 02:25:03.630
Jones, Edward R: Before you open this file is in spider please install Google cloud speech and restart your kernel and otherwise it's not going to work right.

1032
02:25:08.010 --> 02:25:13.830
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so we're in slide number 69, by the way, if you haven't seen that.

1033
02:25:15.630 --> 02:25:20.760
Jones, Edward R: This is the top of the file and so they function there's called wave to text.

1034
02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:39.780
Jones, Edward R: Instead of text to wave it says wave to text and we have 12345 parameters previous previously, we had four parameters and now we have five just like before the first parameter is required.

1035
02:25:40.860 --> 02:25:42.300
Jones, Edward R: And the other.

1036
02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:44.580
Jones, Edward R: The others are optional.

1037
02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:50.070
Jones, Edward R: Now it says speech file here.

1038
02:25:51.120 --> 02:26:03.870
Jones, Edward R: This is either the the name of a local file, which means a file on your computer or it's the name and address of a file in the cloud.

1039
02:26:05.430 --> 02:26:11.340
Jones, Edward R: And we'll talk about the local first so if it's on your computer the type here is local.

1040
02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:16.650
Jones, Edward R: That is the default type, so you don't need to specify type equals local.

1041
02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:31.800
Jones, Edward R: You if this file it's coming in, as on your computer wav file smaller than 1.5 megabytes, then you want to just read it off of your local computer, so the type here would be local.

1042
02:26:33.270 --> 02:26:52.410
Jones, Edward R: If the file is on the cloud the type is you are I uniform Romeo India, you are I and that's the jargon that cloud that Google uses to refer to store things that are stored on the crowd you ri is the address.

1043
02:26:53.670 --> 02:26:57.270
Jones, Edward R: The next one is the language that's being used in the recording.

1044
02:26:58.320 --> 02:27:00.300
Jones, Edward R: So this is language, English.

1045
02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:09.540
Jones, Edward R: The text file, this would be the name of the file, if you want this text file to be stored on your computer somewhere.

1046
02:27:10.920 --> 02:27:14.490
Jones, Edward R: This is the name that you would use to to have it stored on your computer.

1047
02:27:15.930 --> 02:27:33.180
Jones, Edward R: And then there's a time limit that you could set it defaults to 60 to 90 seconds, which for local files is way more than enough, but if you had a longer file on the cloud, you may have to bump that up to a number larger than 90.

1048
02:27:34.830 --> 02:27:46.170
Jones, Edward R: You have a little underneath here you have a little deck dictionary of languages, and this is identical to the dictionary that you saw for the text to wave.

1049
02:27:47.220 --> 02:27:47.790
Jones, Edward R: function.

1050
02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:48.810
Jones, Edward R: In the other code.

1051
02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:56.730
Karen Fireman: Dr Jones Karen I have a question i'm not following you your text to file a text file is none so it's saving it to nothing.

1052
02:27:57.420 --> 02:28:05.550
Jones, Edward R: Well, what happens in that case, so the default is the default says don't this function is not going to save that text file.

1053
02:28:06.540 --> 02:28:17.730
Jones, Edward R: But if you wanted to save it, you will change them to a name or to a path and then name, you know the reason for that is because this function actually returns, the file.

1054
02:28:19.110 --> 02:28:27.450
Jones, Edward R: So you could choose to have it return the file to you and then use it in some other way, for example, you may want to.

1055
02:28:29.190 --> 02:28:36.270
Jones, Edward R: Burning the file out as Chinese and then translate it before you say that all right.

1056
02:28:37.470 --> 02:29:01.440
Jones, Edward R: So you could just leave the text file here is none, and then the wave two texts function will return the translation, which will be in whatever languages that you set that up and then you can translate that file, or whatever you want to do manipulate that file in some way.

1057
02:29:03.810 --> 02:29:06.330
Jones, Edward R: So it's just gives you another option.

1058
02:29:08.700 --> 02:29:18.030
Jones, Edward R: you'll see down below here, then that is setting up your credentials, and this is exactly the same code that's been used all of the api's.

1059
02:29:18.420 --> 02:29:28.860
Jones, Edward R: load credentials from file, and this is basically a Shannon handshake with Google San yeah you can build me for this and Google saying oh Okay, you can use the API.

1060
02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:32.010
Jones, Edward R: that's what's going on there.

1061
02:29:33.900 --> 02:29:44.490
Jones, Edward R: Now speech file, as I mentioned, can be either recording or it can be recording that's been stored in the cloud, which would have a you are I address.

1062
02:29:45.780 --> 02:30:00.930
Jones, Edward R: The type can be local or you are I local is the default the language is the name of the language you just want the name of the language that's being used in the of the scope recording English is the default.

1063
02:30:02.520 --> 02:30:16.830
Jones, Edward R: And then there's this actually this is defaults to non which means do not save the file if you put anything else in there, it will save the trends translation into whatever text file, you name you give it.

1064
02:30:17.940 --> 02:30:22.440
Jones, Edward R: And then of course it defaults to 90 seconds maximum time for processing.

1065
02:30:23.850 --> 02:30:24.930
Jones, Edward R: You can change that.

1066
02:30:26.730 --> 02:30:37.500
Jones, Edward R: Alright, so if it's a local file what happens is it opens the file notice it's opening it is rb and and i'll take that comment that we had earlier.

1067
02:30:39.510 --> 02:30:51.210
Jones, Edward R: This might be, you know, in the earlier one you had a was a right or was it a read I forget it was a read, but you had to say encoding equals ut dash eight.

1068
02:30:52.620 --> 02:31:05.190
Jones, Edward R: Well, this is not a ut you don't say in code equals ut of that shade here, this is not a text file, this is a binary file and the encoding year is actually.

1069
02:31:06.630 --> 02:31:14.130
Jones, Edward R: One of the different names for it but it's going to be a wave and coding and i'm not sure whether you'd actually you know.

1070
02:31:16.350 --> 02:31:25.260
Jones, Edward R: Whoever found this problem and windows i'm not sure there's a problem here or not, and if there is one i'm not sure what the encoding would be.

1071
02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:28.110
Swanson J, Charles Richard: Dr Jones there's no problem that runs just fine.

1072
02:31:28.410 --> 02:31:39.630
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so that encoding thing was just with respect to reading a text file you to pay okay that sounds good i'm glad to confirm that no changes necessary.

1073
02:31:40.830 --> 02:31:48.840
Jones, Edward R: So this, then what we doing is we're trying to read this file and if we can't read it, there is an error message that's presented.

1074
02:31:49.560 --> 02:32:07.110
Jones, Edward R: After the file is red we determine how large, it is in megabytes so I take the length of the recording and divide by a million and I get the size and may, if the size of megabytes is zero that means it's an empty file we're out of here.

1075
02:32:08.460 --> 02:32:12.270
Jones, Edward R: If the size is greater than 1.5 megabytes.

1076
02:32:13.740 --> 02:32:16.140
Jones, Edward R: We can't do this as a local recording we're out of here.

1077
02:32:17.190 --> 02:32:29.130
Jones, Edward R: You need to put that file up in the cloud and us and you are I address if you have recording greater than 1.5, so this is actually checking for that.

1078
02:32:30.180 --> 02:32:35.700
Jones, Edward R: And if you pass all of that, then it says Okay, the audio is equal to whatever's in that recording.

1079
02:32:37.470 --> 02:32:40.110
Jones, Edward R: If the if the type is you ri.

1080
02:32:41.130 --> 02:32:50.490
Jones, Edward R: Then it says Okay, the audio is equal to the speech file in the cloud with that address your IP address.

1081
02:32:52.650 --> 02:33:00.720
Jones, Edward R: Otherwise, this is dumb there's an error here speech file is not local and it's not a URL file so.

1082
02:33:01.020 --> 02:33:05.010
Karen Fireman: What is the dresser is Karen where would it be if it's a your eye.

1083
02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:06.660
Jones, Edward R: On the cloud.

1084
02:33:08.040 --> 02:33:08.790
Karen Fireman: How do we find it.

1085
02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:10.170
Jones, Edward R: i'll show you that.

1086
02:33:10.500 --> 02:33:11.400
Karen Fireman: Okay yeah.

1087
02:33:12.690 --> 02:33:25.260
Jones, Edward R: yeah you have to go to your dashboard and look at storage and then the founder stories you'll find you'll find the cloud you'll find your buckets of stuff in there in the cloud okay.

1088
02:33:26.220 --> 02:33:36.900
Jones, Edward R: All right, so, then we try to process the speech we try here with this is a thing that can fail if they bad if the audio is not properly recorded as a wav file.

1089
02:33:37.890 --> 02:33:49.860
Jones, Edward R: A Mano channel wav file, this will fail and so that's why I have the right, except block here recording is not wave mono encoding failed.

1090
02:33:50.430 --> 02:34:02.250
Jones, Edward R: And the actual error message will give you more input into what it might have been, and one possibility is that it's an MP3 file MP3 files are not currently supported by this API.

1091
02:34:08.970 --> 02:34:16.860
Jones, Edward R: And then, here we finished the conversion with this statement said responses equal to operation dash result, there is a timeout limit.

1092
02:34:18.660 --> 02:34:20.820
Jones, Edward R: Now here's The other thing it's kind of funky.

1093
02:34:21.900 --> 02:34:33.360
Jones, Edward R: This API it actually produces the translation or the API the text in chunks chunks of about 5000 characters each approximately.

1094
02:34:33.870 --> 02:34:41.130
Jones, Edward R: And you have to read these chunks and put them together, so this part of the code, it says chunks equal to zero transcript is empty.

1095
02:34:41.430 --> 02:34:48.090
Jones, Edward R: And then it goes through a loop of grabbing the chunks and putting them together, so the transcript here you'll see.

1096
02:34:48.840 --> 02:35:00.210
Jones, Edward R: it's actually adding you see it says, Chris rate plus this this chunk and it's it goes through here, and each time through there, it takes a certain number of characters approximately 5000.

1097
02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:09.960
Jones, Edward R: brings the next 5000 in and as it to the transcript the next time and I don't know why they did it this way, but yes, this is the way it has to be done.

1098
02:35:11.370 --> 02:35:12.060
Jones, Edward R: So.

1099
02:35:13.140 --> 02:35:18.600
Jones, Edward R: When you see the code it's pretty simple but Okay, where did I get this documentation.

1100
02:35:20.460 --> 02:35:31.440
Jones, Edward R: Well, what can I say all right, I didn't write the code, that is, the API might have been different, but there are there must be a really good reason why they did this way, but it OK OK OK.

1101
02:35:31.860 --> 02:35:38.040
Jones, Edward R: They also give you something for confidence and it's the percentage of provenance they have in the transcription.

1102
02:35:38.820 --> 02:35:54.240
Jones, Edward R: So if you have a good recording the confidence will be high, if you have a noisy recording the confidence is going to be low whatever it is, you can look at the confidence numbers, the church what the computer thinks of your recording.

1103
02:35:55.800 --> 02:36:09.000
Jones, Edward R: So a good recording will be something that I did with a nice microphone with no noise in the background, I regard get a 98 or 97 probably sometimes not if i'm kind of slurring you know.

1104
02:36:10.020 --> 02:36:21.120
Jones, Edward R: Anyway, it returns, the transcript if the transcript was created, you see if the file is none it, it does not return it does not save it.

1105
02:36:21.630 --> 02:36:33.600
Jones, Edward R: If the file is something other than none, it tries to save the file right here, at any rate, it always returns, the transcripts That gives you an option to grab it as a return from this function.

1106
02:36:35.130 --> 02:36:36.750
Jones, Edward R: So here's a test case.

1107
02:36:38.460 --> 02:36:53.640
Jones, Edward R: translation is equal to wave two texts and here's a local recording Hello dot wave it's a local recording you probably already have this one somewhere might be called something different just put the name of the recording right here.

1108
02:36:55.170 --> 02:37:09.540
Jones, Edward R: And then you can run this test case and what you should see is waiting for audio conversion and it, this is by the way, not real fast waiting for audio conversion may take.

1109
02:37:10.620 --> 02:37:13.620
Jones, Edward R: I don't know i'm in it, in this case.

1110
02:37:14.820 --> 02:37:31.440
Jones, Edward R: And then, it says transcript hello, do we speaking, or do you speak English and notice the confidence 70% okay all right, so I think I made that recording and I was maybe not too good with us so say I think it was better than the 70, but I do want to give me a 70.

1111
02:37:33.270 --> 02:37:36.210
Jones, Edward R: here's another example get us burger dress.

1112
02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:45.300
Jones, Edward R: So yes, I did record the gettysburg address gettysburg dot wave.

1113
02:37:46.650 --> 02:37:52.530
Jones, Edward R: This will throw an error, because the actual gettysburg address is more than 1.5 megabytes.

1114
02:37:53.580 --> 02:38:03.960
Jones, Edward R: So when you go wave to text Ginsburg got wave you'll get an error message you see it says error recording 3.7 megabytes.

1115
02:38:05.130 --> 02:38:19.440
Jones, Edward R: Unable to convert local recordings greater than 1.5 megabytes so that's just basically reminding you, if you do give it a recording it's too big it doesn't crash your computer it just says hey this is too big.

1116
02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:23.040
Jones, Edward R: Now here's another example Allah.

1117
02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:25.890
Jones, Edward R: This is the Spanish recording.

1118
02:38:27.270 --> 02:38:40.710
Jones, Edward R: And so I may have actually tried this myself like Oh, you know comas family so something like that, but so here we're trying to put the transcript and all that text.

1119
02:38:41.370 --> 02:38:54.720
Jones, Edward R: So transcript Ola come with como the stars I don't think this so yeah that was, I think it may have recorded that myself and I got an this time okay.

1120
02:38:56.310 --> 02:39:00.390
Jones, Edward R: Maybe I speak Spanish, but other than English I don't know so.

1121
02:39:01.470 --> 02:39:03.570
Jones, Edward R: I know that's not true, but.

1122
02:39:04.770 --> 02:39:17.610
Jones, Edward R: Anyway, and so here's your homework assignment, you can see how this is going to work out all right, so you want to make this this gooey here and you've already you should already know.

1123
02:39:18.210 --> 02:39:21.690
Jones, Edward R: How to create this gooey without the functionality.

1124
02:39:22.140 --> 02:39:33.120
Jones, Edward R: So when you're working on a good, the first thing you work at is, let me get this thing running without any functionality and we get the buttons in the right place and so forth, and so on, so what do I have here.

1125
02:39:33.690 --> 02:39:44.910
Jones, Edward R: I have one frame this is the canvas and then, I have two frames are left brain and right brain, so this is the Left frame in the right frame.

1126
02:39:45.660 --> 02:40:01.020
Jones, Edward R: In the Left frame, I have an entry, I have a label right there English, I have an entry box, then I have two buttons that I have another label, so this would be row one column one row two.

1127
02:40:02.190 --> 02:40:19.410
Jones, Edward R: column one, this would be a row three column one this is row three column to actually two columns here, and then I have row for label column one.

1128
02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:31.650
Jones, Edward R: Then I have a text box and that text boxes row five columns one the column spam on the text box, though, because fan is to.

1129
02:40:32.220 --> 02:40:38.220
Jones, Edward R: This because it's covering both the speak button and the clear button, there are two columns here.

1130
02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:47.790
Jones, Edward R: So this text box because man is too, and I think the row span is one, but you can play with the road span to get it to be the right size.

1131
02:40:48.750 --> 02:41:02.310
Jones, Edward R: Now, you also have to play with the geometry there's you know within a link within the height, the number and the top of the gui definition that basically makes structures, this thing to be the right size.

1132
02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:08.640
Jones, Edward R: And then the right frame will be here, well, first, I have a label at the top.

1133
02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:14.250
Jones, Edward R: This is the Basically, this is the mainframe label.

1134
02:41:15.510 --> 02:41:21.720
Jones, Edward R: Short communication language, this is going on the mainframe column one column two.

1135
02:41:22.740 --> 02:41:26.850
Jones, Edward R: And then, this is on the right frame, I have a list box.

1136
02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:36.000
Jones, Edward R: And then the, there is the homework three I think in homework three, there is an example of a list box.

1137
02:41:37.500 --> 02:41:45.000
Jones, Edward R: Maybe not, I have to give you, if not i'll get you make sure you get one in the Q amp a tomorrow night we can talk about this, but.

1138
02:41:45.870 --> 02:42:03.480
Jones, Edward R: By the end of the Q amp a tomorrow night, you should be able to create this gooey now once it's created, then you have to add functionality to it right, so the entry box here, there is no functionality here there's no click.

1139
02:42:04.530 --> 02:42:12.240
Jones, Edward R: This button is the where where the action happens right here, when you click that button it's going to read whatever's in the entry box.

1140
02:42:13.260 --> 02:42:27.840
Jones, Edward R: And then translate it according to whatever is selected among these target languages, so in this case I selected Chinese and then, when I clicked on this little button it produces the translation in the writing and writing.

1141
02:42:29.340 --> 02:42:36.660
Jones, Edward R: Now, if you click on the clear button, it will clear this area, right here, and it also clears the entry box.

1142
02:42:37.770 --> 02:42:39.900
Jones, Edward R: So resets those two areas.

1143
02:42:41.430 --> 02:42:48.900
Jones, Edward R: If you click on the in these row lists here you're selecting the target language nothing really happens when you click on that.

1144
02:42:49.500 --> 02:43:04.650
Jones, Edward R: But when you click on the speech button it reads whatever you've clicked on it says what did you click on over here because he needs that's being used to decide what I should do within the entry box here what language Do I need to translate it into.

1145
02:43:08.160 --> 02:43:23.790
Jones, Edward R: let's see now this speech button right here, not only do you translate it and then paste it into this text box, you also convert it to speech, this is a text to speech and you play it.

1146
02:43:25.530 --> 02:43:31.440
Jones, Edward R: that's when it says speech not just translate if you've already done translate for this.

1147
02:43:32.760 --> 02:43:45.750
Jones, Edward R: The translate board is just producing the translation in the text box on the bottom, the reason it says speech is because it also expect that after you do the translation.

1148
02:43:46.980 --> 02:43:59.010
Jones, Edward R: you're going to have somebody speak the translation on the computer now this case, it would have to be it would need to be a Chinese voice speaking, whatever that says right there.

1149
02:44:00.510 --> 02:44:13.710
Jones, Edward R: If you check Spanish you're going to get a Spanish translation and then the on the computer, you will hear whatever use it as a speaker you'll hear a Spanish speaking person read that translation.

1150
02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:15.660
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

1151
02:44:18.060 --> 02:44:27.840
Jones, Edward R: We will talk more about this tomorrow night in the q&a if you have questions so you think about how you want to approach this, there is no template there is no one template for this are many.

1152
02:44:28.410 --> 02:44:35.670
Jones, Edward R: Okay, the homework three template is really close, you can take the homework three template and modify it a little bit.

1153
02:44:36.870 --> 02:44:50.550
Jones, Edward R: And pretty quickly come up with this this particular movie right here, I think the challenge might be the speak button getting the you know, the text to speech and then playing, that of the speaker.

1154
02:44:51.780 --> 02:45:04.890
Jones, Edward R: that's an extra step, but really if you take a look at the Apps that we went over tonight, the one that says text to speech play that one or just text to speech, the one that uses the.

1155
02:45:06.870 --> 02:45:08.430
Jones, Edward R: Simple audio I think it is.

1156
02:45:10.350 --> 02:45:11.100
Jones, Edward R: Those.

1157
02:45:12.960 --> 02:45:32.880
Jones, Edward R: Those are pretty much solid you know some you call those functions from the speak you click the speak book you first call the trick translate button function, and then you go the texts speech function that you saw in that other program and you got it so.

1158
02:45:34.410 --> 02:45:44.520
Jones, Edward R: It might be more challenging than the others in some respects, but not that bad Okay, we will talk tomorrow night at Q amp a any questions now.

1159
02:45:50.430 --> 02:45:51.840
Karis Jochen: I have a quick question.

1160
02:45:52.440 --> 02:45:52.860
Jones, Edward R: This is.

1161
02:45:53.940 --> 02:45:55.080
Karis Jochen: This is charisse.

1162
02:45:56.670 --> 02:46:16.590
Karis Jochen: are so on the homework, I just wanted to clarify Whenever someone types in English into the text box, then it automatically should translate in i'm underneath without having to click a button.

1163
02:46:18.420 --> 02:46:26.880
Jones, Edward R: Well, I, like the button better because sometimes you don't you want to misspell you miss about something or you want to change what your type so.

1164
02:46:28.650 --> 02:46:39.450
Karen Fireman: appreciate your comment i'm not sure I understand it, either when you're clicking the language is the language, doing everything and does it matter what language, the input was originally.

1165
02:46:41.190 --> 02:46:52.200
Jones, Edward R: know the the language on the right hand side is the is the you're taking the language that's coming in the language that's coming in, you know will we're going to make it.

1166
02:46:54.990 --> 02:47:01.830
Jones, Edward R: hang on something to happen here all right we're going to make it simple and the incoming language will.

1167
02:47:05.610 --> 02:47:10.680
Jones, Edward R: be English, in other words, what do you type in the entry box is going to be English.

1168
02:47:11.970 --> 02:47:21.270
Jones, Edward R: When you click on the language on the right hand side that's the target language so we're going to translate whatever's in the English to the target language.

1169
02:47:22.290 --> 02:47:29.130
Jones, Edward R: And then we're going to have somebody speak that trans translation using the target language.

1170
02:47:31.230 --> 02:47:39.360
Karen Fireman: gotcha and one other question is there a reason we can't use the click boxes, we did on the last program for the languages, why we have to do it in a different way.

1171
02:47:41.520 --> 02:47:42.060
Jones, Edward R: and

1172
02:47:42.270 --> 02:47:43.440
Swanson J, Charles Richard: So we can learn something new.

1173
02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:45.420
Jones, Edward R: out.

1174
02:47:45.750 --> 02:47:48.360
Jones, Edward R: There, there are two reasons there's two reasons for that.

1175
02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:52.440
Jones, Edward R: The person who ever said that Charles.

1176
02:47:52.680 --> 02:47:53.730
Karen Fireman: Charles did Thank you.

1177
02:47:53.730 --> 02:47:55.260
Jones, Edward R: chunky he's a genius.

1178
02:47:55.620 --> 02:47:55.980
Okay.

1179
02:47:57.360 --> 02:48:05.640
Jones, Edward R: yeah it's something else the list box turns out to be much cleaner and easier to it looks different in some respects.

1180
02:48:06.300 --> 02:48:21.660
Jones, Edward R: Sometimes you might want to prefer the other form the the radio buttons or the click buttons, so it is just something new that i'd like you to see because it's much easier, it is easier for this application to use it, then the year is the code is much smaller.

1181
02:48:22.830 --> 02:48:23.550
Jones, Edward R: When you use it.

1182
02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:32.010
Jones, Edward R: So I guess that that is the real reason why i'm suggesting useless box over there, and so the checkbox.

1183
02:48:32.070 --> 02:48:49.890
Jordan Gross: And Karen I would say, from a ux perspective, the generally accepted it experiences that you can select multiple checkboxes only singles for radio buttons so right now there's a lot of code that we've had to add that says uncheck everything else, every time something's clicked.

1184
02:48:50.490 --> 02:48:51.300
Jones, Edward R: That should.

1185
02:48:52.020 --> 02:48:55.020
Jones, Edward R: work by default that for you so it's a.

1186
02:48:55.020 --> 02:48:55.470
Jones, Edward R: Nice.

1187
02:48:55.590 --> 02:48:58.440
Karen Fireman: yeah that's not true he's calling it a list he didn't.

1188
02:48:58.470 --> 02:49:01.680
Jones, Edward R: Call it rated coda radio button in the list the same way.

1189
02:49:02.190 --> 02:49:03.690
Jordan Gross: They work, the same they still.

1190
02:49:03.690 --> 02:49:05.040
Jordan Gross: nicely me allow for single.

1191
02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:08.790
Karen Fireman: select yeah I gotcha I gotcha I see okay.

1192
02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:18.330
Jones, Edward R: hang on here wait a minute this box is by default and Python or universe or unit you're only allowed to check one it won't let you check more than one all.

1193
02:49:19.350 --> 02:49:20.940
Jordan Gross: The checkboxes for.

1194
02:49:20.970 --> 02:49:25.530
Jordan Gross: tck did appear I could select multiple they were either set to alternate.

1195
02:49:25.530 --> 02:49:37.320
Jones, Edward R: variables both of them, you can allow you can enable in both, though, and you can enable multiple clicks but in the in Python the default behavior on the list is you won.

1196
02:49:38.340 --> 02:49:43.230
Jones, Edward R: The you know, is by if you have to do so, you have to go write some extra code to get multiple.

1197
02:49:44.580 --> 02:49:48.690
Jones, Edward R: So it turns out to be pretty simple, for, if you do spend a single click.

1198
02:49:49.770 --> 02:49:51.300
Jones, Edward R: it's ugly if you got multiple.

1199
02:49:52.620 --> 02:49:54.180
Karen Fireman: lists or list box.

1200
02:49:54.930 --> 02:50:00.390
Jones, Edward R: list box young okay like and list list list list Li.

1201
02:50:01.470 --> 02:50:02.370
Jones, Edward R: Li St.

1202
02:50:04.380 --> 02:50:08.910
Jones, Edward R: The stupid mask hopefully we'll get rid of these soon okay.

1203
02:50:10.170 --> 02:50:15.030
Karis Jochen: i'm Dr Jones is charisse again i'm sorry I I didn't.

1204
02:50:16.650 --> 02:50:33.090
Karis Jochen: I didn't really get my question answered um so I type in English into the text box and then nothing happens until I press the speak button Is that correct.

1205
02:50:33.690 --> 02:50:34.230
Jones, Edward R: that's correct.

1206
02:50:34.650 --> 02:50:38.940
Karis Jochen: Okay, I just wanted to make sure that okay great Thank you.

1207
02:50:43.980 --> 02:50:44.430
Jones, Edward R: Clear.

1208
02:50:45.750 --> 02:50:48.630
Jones, Edward R: Jordan you good you look worried, the okay.

1209
02:50:49.740 --> 02:50:54.060
Jordan Gross: i'm Professor i'm always reading something about some different problem i'm having on another screen.

1210
02:50:54.060 --> 02:50:54.570
Jordan Gross: So.

1211
02:50:54.960 --> 02:50:55.590
Jones, Edward R: Hopefully, I was.

1212
02:50:55.800 --> 02:50:57.510
Jones, Edward R: Getting worried a sinner ignoring this.

1213
02:50:57.510 --> 02:51:00.810
Jones, Edward R: conversation okay that's all right.

1214
02:51:01.560 --> 02:51:02.670
Jones, Edward R: Oh, someone you know.

1215
02:51:03.240 --> 02:51:06.540
Jordan Gross: boxes in the chat as as you go Google combo boxes, make sure I.

1216
02:51:06.540 --> 02:51:07.290
Know yeah.

1217
02:51:08.970 --> 02:51:18.990
Jones, Edward R: yeah there are, this is a list box right it's to enter in Java, you have list boxes in javascript you have was boxes and they're very different.

1218
02:51:20.610 --> 02:51:21.540
Jones, Edward R: They behave differently.

1219
02:51:22.470 --> 02:51:24.000
Karen Fireman: To tea okay.

1220
02:51:25.170 --> 02:51:25.590
Jones, Edward R: What.

1221
02:51:26.220 --> 02:51:28.110
Karen Fireman: it's to enter TT can.

1222
02:51:30.510 --> 02:51:34.170
Karen Fireman: don't we have two versions of everything T cantor and TT K.

1223
02:51:34.470 --> 02:51:36.180
Jones, Edward R: yeah yeah there's there's tikkun.

1224
02:51:36.390 --> 02:51:37.050
Karen Fireman: What is it.

1225
02:51:38.310 --> 02:51:39.120
Jones, Edward R: The list box.

1226
02:51:39.750 --> 02:51:41.070
Jones, Edward R: Yes, it's a.

1227
02:51:42.960 --> 02:51:43.530
Jones, Edward R: tk.

1228
02:51:45.540 --> 02:51:49.110
Jones, Edward R: So what is that list box is a tk widget.

1229
02:51:50.790 --> 02:52:01.500
Jones, Edward R: The list boxes of tk which and the text boxes to tk which, which means make sure that grid statement is a separate statement not tacked on at the end.

1230
02:52:02.670 --> 02:52:03.060
Jones, Edward R: Right.

1231
02:52:03.150 --> 02:52:03.780
Jones, Edward R: By the way.

1232
02:52:05.520 --> 02:52:12.360
Jones, Edward R: i'll give you i'll show you some code, where the users, the list boxing see if you can't figure it out, you look take a look at that.

1233
02:52:16.860 --> 02:52:18.030
Jones, Edward R: Okay, Jim.

1234
02:52:19.080 --> 02:52:22.050
Jones, Edward R: Are we ready to close down this this room meeting or what.

1235
02:52:23.940 --> 02:52:27.810
Zuberi, Bilal Mustafa: Yes, thank you, Dr Jones really appreciate it because I notes are very good.

1236
02:52:28.110 --> 02:52:28.950
Swanson J, Charles Richard: Yes, thank you.

1237
02:52:28.980 --> 02:52:29.970
Jim Clark: very much.

1238
02:52:30.480 --> 02:52:33.420
Jim Clark: So what so we take it off recording.

1239
02:52:34.050 --> 02:52:37.290
Jones, Edward R: Wait a minute we're going to take it off or you want me to stop the recording and we can talk.

1240
02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:39.180
Karen Fireman: A second Defense.

1241
02:52:40.320 --> 02:52:41.430
Jim Clark: I can be at the end and.

1242
02:52:41.610 --> 02:52:46.830
Jim Clark: I just something I was going to ask you about the didn't need to be recorded it nothing controversial just.

1243
02:52:47.640 --> 02:52:48.210
Jim Clark: cook yeah.

1244
02:52:48.300 --> 02:52:57.270
Jones, Edward R: Well, hang on a minute here let's, let me make a couple of one I forgot some news comments, please start thinking about your class project for this class.

1245
02:52:57.900 --> 02:53:20.550
Jones, Edward R: At this point, you've you've seen a lot enough to define a project around this idea of creating a gooey that somehow translates or produces a you know different speech or text files, you can see how that might work, maybe a simple version of your own simple version of alexa.

1246
02:53:22.050 --> 02:53:26.910
Jones, Edward R: So trick questions about what's for dinner tonight, or something like that.

1247
02:53:27.450 --> 02:53:45.570
Jones, Edward R: i'm not expecting you're going to clear your were hungry or i'm not expecting the capstone project i'm so i'm expecting something that might be, you know, a read that well, first of all originality and looking for originality and second the that is maybe comparable to to a homework problem.

1248
02:53:46.740 --> 02:53:48.330
Jones, Edward R: And, and you know.

1249
02:53:49.440 --> 02:54:06.000
Jones, Edward R: depending upon how many people are working on this, it can be pretty complicated or involved or not, if you're if you're working solo or just two people i'm not i'd like to see something that's creative, but you know i'm not expecting the really big involve.

1250
02:54:07.260 --> 02:54:23.940
Jones, Edward R: Project here Okay, this is just for this one class, so I want you to start talking about that, because in about two weeks i'm going to be asking for a discussion a proposed see, I would like to see some graphs around what you're proposing to do.

1251
02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:28.680
Jones, Edward R: And we could have a little conversation about that.

1252
02:54:29.850 --> 02:54:45.210
Jones, Edward R: And maybe talk about overlap if there's some projects that are that are overlapping and that sort of thing, and maybe some other things that you want my I want to do okay so as we were coming pretty close to the finishing the Google part.

1253
02:54:46.770 --> 02:54:56.070
Jones, Edward R: The API the Google API thing and the Google thing i'm also I want to talk a little bit about the Google options for.

1254
02:54:56.790 --> 02:55:07.890
Jones, Edward R: image analysis vision image analysis, because later on in tensorflow and curious we're going to talk about image recognition and how that's that's done and.

1255
02:55:08.820 --> 02:55:21.840
Jones, Edward R: it's nice to see that there is an API for that and Google so we'll be able to compare what we can do with Google to what we can do over here with tensorflow and charisse, and this is another option.

1256
02:55:22.860 --> 02:55:23.700
Jones, Edward R: So.

1257
02:55:25.080 --> 02:55:32.310
Jones, Edward R: And certainly there's also you know we didn't talk about this there that, in addition to the API you know the search engine.

1258
02:55:33.180 --> 02:55:42.060
Jones, Edward R: And the Google map thing you know the map thing Those are all in that in that area too, you can take your credentials and you can write a program that uses the.

1259
02:55:42.870 --> 02:55:54.600
Jones, Edward R: The Google map application to chart a course and I actually wrote a program wants to, we had a data competition, it was a data competition.

1260
02:55:54.990 --> 02:55:59.550
Jones, Edward R: And involved bicycle renting rental bicycle Rentals and we needed to know.

1261
02:56:00.450 --> 02:56:09.090
Jones, Edward R: If a person rents, a bicycle here point A and goes to Point B, what is the expected time for that route, what is the best route and what's the expected time.

1262
02:56:09.540 --> 02:56:17.910
Jones, Edward R: On the Google APP for for maps lets you do that, you can say i'm on a bicycle and i'm going from this point to that point, how long does it.

1263
02:56:18.300 --> 02:56:29.700
Jones, Edward R: And how long, should it take that actually they actually produce that information, so I can say I could look at each trip and say Okay, this should have taken 30 minutes and the guy was like three four hours, what happened.

1264
02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:42.960
Jones, Edward R: And why eliza three or four so you can you can look at your data by absorbing some of that information and that's that's just another APP it's that all the Google Apps that you're familiar with.

1265
02:56:43.470 --> 02:56:50.940
Jones, Edward R: The Google drive the Google map thing all of those are accessible via these api's and.

1266
02:56:51.630 --> 02:57:06.180
Jones, Edward R: So we'll we'll talk we're going to talk a little bit about that going forward and then and then we're going to transition from that into looking at drones and how you program drones and that might be kind of fun to see if we can come up with a voice.

1267
02:57:07.320 --> 02:57:09.120
Jones, Edward R: voice control drawing drone.

1268
02:57:10.710 --> 02:57:21.990
Jones, Edward R: said once you see oh that's program i'm not sure that the latency time on the computer is going to be fast enough to do that those drones through some of those drones are pretty quick but we'll see.

1269
02:57:23.160 --> 02:57:28.590
Jones, Edward R: Okay well that's it for tonight i'll see you tomorrow night, then it, what is it seven o'clock.
