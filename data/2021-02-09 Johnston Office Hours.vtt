21
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.010
Jim Clark: In the pipeline and and going through the lectures, they are pulling.

22
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.800
Jim Clark: Something is not in the directory is coming out from the web and and getting it, and so what I can run them.

23
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:48.660
Jim Clark: But I don't know that I have I haven't found a file that I can plug in Instead of that, so what I was just trying to understand if you want us to run it to see that we can make make that file run or whether we need to find a suitable replacement file.

24
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:57.750
Faculty Office Hours: yeah yeah it is get your own data set and replace my data set and then use your own data set and just split it so you can like go look at like some stuff made over the summer, Dr Jones.

25
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.910
Faculty Office Hours: You know and pull one of those data sets but yeah it's just it's basically take the template I did for the pickle file.

26
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:18.870
Faculty Office Hours: and replace it with your data set and then take the template I did for the mo live, I mean that the pipeline and the job live take that one and put your own data into it just make it kind of take that as a template.

Faculty Office Hours: bet maybe.

422
00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:07.500
I think.

423
00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:09.750
Karen Fireman: This one right.

424
00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:11.430
Faculty Office Hours: Now yeah yeah.

425
00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:13.380

426
00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:17.430
Karen Fireman: store right run this file and current file.

427
00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:18.690
Faculty Office Hours: And window yeah.

428
00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:24.900
Karen Fireman: And that's that's where it has a problem it just find that URL.

429
00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:27.150
Faculty Office Hours: let's see know.

430
00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.110
Faculty Office Hours: Your work your work you're working you're done.

431
00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:32.970
Karen Fireman: Before with.

432
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:34.620
Faculty Office Hours: The error message I.

433
00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:41.790
Faculty Office Hours: got was, but you might have just had it, you might have just been in some state where you didn't realize that it stopped and then you forgot to hit deploy again.

434
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:45.780
Karen Fireman: But you're gonna think maybe I had to underplay or close out or something.

435
00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:46.380
Possibly.

436
00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:53.010
Faculty Office Hours: They would happen is you probably so here's what probably happened, you did deployed, and it did the image right.

437
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.820
Karen Fireman: Right right.

438
00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:55.740
Faculty Office Hours: And then try to run and got an error right.

439
00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:56.400
Karen Fireman: Right.

440
00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:04.200
Faculty Office Hours: And so, and the error was probably because, like you said, because the capital, so you went and changed the capitals, could you debug that you put a lowercase.

441
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.040
Faculty Office Hours: Right, then you.

442
00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:06.540
Faculty Office Hours: can deploy again.

443
00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:07.320
Karen Fireman: Right.

444
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:12.120
Faculty Office Hours: But the image was already built with the capital, so it can't override that image it was already built.

445
00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.650
Faculty Office Hours: You needed to do so in that and deploy that.

446
00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:18.420
Faculty Office Hours: Time.

447
00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:23.970
Faculty Office Hours: Stopping the server container and removing the container and i'm removing the image and I didn't deploy script.

448
00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:35.100
Faculty Office Hours: You don't really necessarily run that like it's not something you run after you it's like it's I put that off there's a cleanup script so that when you're debugging you hit and deploy you get rid of everything you fix your code you type deploying a running right.

449
00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:36.390
Karen Fireman: that's what happened.

450
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:37.230
that's exactly.

451
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:38.730
Karen Fireman: Thank you.

452
00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.080
Faculty Office Hours: Your cake Karen.

453
00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:43.950
Faculty Office Hours: yeah lie to you, I told you, if you sat down for a few hours you figured out right.

454
00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.500
Karen Fireman: He was five hours, I want to be honest with everybody.

455
00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:46.830
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

456
00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.420
Karen Fireman: If I say, but you were right.

457
00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:49.260
Faculty Office Hours: You were right yeah.

458
00:32:49.530 --> 00:33:00.660
Faculty Office Hours: You did so, so you think about this, you guys are learning stuff that i've bit like weeks before trying to teach my it data science people how to do and say still didn't get it so.

459
00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:08.010
Karen Fireman: Well, you made it really easy after we after we struggled this little this little three commands is pretty straightforward.

460
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:17.460
Faculty Office Hours: that's why I did it this way because, for me, you know I speak a lot like I speak 1015 times a year pre pre coven right.

461
00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:35.550
Faculty Office Hours: at conferences someone Dr someone Python seminar someone database stuff and azure in the cloud and and what i've learned is, if you can bundle stuff up for people and a reusable piece of code, they can learn and so that's why I do it the way I do it, and so.

462
00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:42.870
Faculty Office Hours: So there you go so sorry, are you good Carol i'll see if I else has any questions.

463
00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:47.070
Karen Fireman: i'm great Thank you all right.

464
00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:50.670
Faculty Office Hours: So who has who asked questions.

465
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:18.120
Clay Coleman: So I wouldn't quick when I did the homework but I did it on I don't know if there was a specific script you wanted us to do, I just made sure I did one job 11 what i'm pickle or was there a specific.

466
00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:21.270
Faculty Office Hours: yeah So if you lose the instruction, this is do one with pickle.

467
00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:22.440
Clay Coleman: Right, I did that.

468
00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:24.420
Faculty Office Hours: For example, and then use one with the.

469
00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:26.670
Faculty Office Hours: ml the the.

470
00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.080
Faculty Office Hours: The.

471
00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:34.680
Faculty Office Hours: The pipelines and the job line so there's one job live, which is just this was just just basic.

472
00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:51.270
Faculty Office Hours: But the one I want you to do is the one that uses job live and those ml pipelines and psychic learn So if you notice in the home week and the week, one that I have pickle I have job live with that have one that's like job lines and job live like ml pipelines, let me see if I can.

473
00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:56.190
Faculty Office Hours: crashing my machine decided to turn off on me oh my battery's dead apparently.

474
00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:59.010
Karen Fireman: You talking about this one worker last homework.

475
00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.390
Faculty Office Hours: he's talking about last homework.

476
00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:01.710
Karen Fireman: Oh okay.

477
00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:02.730
Faculty Office Hours: Right play.

478
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.380
Clay Coleman: Yes, yeah yeah.

479
00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:14.190
Faculty Office Hours: yeah So if you if you open up the week one downloads you'll see pickle you'll see job live I think there's one that says like job live DEMO pipelines, I think.

480
00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:15.120
Clay Coleman: Okay.

481
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:16.170
Faculty Office Hours: My personal.

482
00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.450
Faculty Office Hours: Personal laptop died on me so.

483
00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:31.260
Karen Fireman: I had that happen also play I did the job live after the first one, and then I found it Oh, he wanted us new job live on his job like one he had one with wine, I think, or or or iris or something that had job blind person.

484
00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:44.580
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I think it's iris is the one for the job live with the pipelines so i'll i'll when we get off this call i'll send announced without everybody cuz it sounds like some people were confused and then i'll just that way people will know.

485
00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:48.270
Clay Coleman: yeah I did I did the extra boost on both of them.

486
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:52.110
Karen Fireman: that's that's what I had done also and then I realized he wanted something different.

487
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:57.420
Faculty Office Hours: yeah what the ml pipelines, I wanted to show you how you so the cool thing about those psychic learn pipelines.

488
00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:08.310
Faculty Office Hours: is, if you look at that code, you can do multiple different things, and then you have a way where you can test to see which one was the best one, and then you say that out, and then that becomes your.

489
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:16.290
Faculty Office Hours: Then that becomes the model you use right so it's kind of like it's kind of like showing you how enterprise minor does things right, where you pick the the.

490
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:24.150
Faculty Office Hours: Five different things that you're trying to test, and then you put them all together into like an evaluation node and it tells you this was the best one and that's the one who uses right.

491
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:32.070
Faculty Office Hours: that's the same thing those ml pipelines and psychic learn are doing right, so you had like I forget, which I forget the examples I use off top my head, but.

492
00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:38.850
Faculty Office Hours: I hope my laptop just died on me, I have to go get my on my iPad so.

493
00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:41.700
Faculty Office Hours: If you don't mind Karen.

494
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:44.100
Faculty Office Hours: I appreciate it.

495
00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:46.890
Faculty Office Hours: I was gonna open it up on my iPad, but if you can share it.

496
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.570
Karen Fireman: Okay, see you wanted to go to i'm just so you told me but tell me again.

497
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.190
Faculty Office Hours: yeah just go to the week one folder.

498
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.400
yeah.

499
00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.510
Clay Coleman: Karen i've already got it i'm working on right now here i'll just.

500
00:36:57.810 --> 00:36:58.050
Karen Fireman: Make it.

501
00:36:58.980 --> 00:36:59.370
perfect.

502
00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.770
Clay Coleman: Oh yeah okay.

503
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:17.460
Faculty Office Hours: yeah you're right he was asking about the homework being do it's do a week from this coming Thursday, so you have two weeks from last Thursday for homework, too, so what we do this Thursday but next.

504
00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:21.750
Faculty Office Hours: So yeah so.

505
00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:29.880
Faculty Office Hours: You see, the.

506
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:38.880
Faculty Office Hours: yeah i'm not sure where you're at so that is not the right right one that's just job live right So if you look at your.

507
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.310
Clay Coleman: Job live ml pipeline.

508
00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:42.360
Okay.

509
00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:53.340
Faculty Office Hours: Is that the pipeline okay I got you I see yeah yeah see aren't there yet your pipeline right and you're going to standardize on a random forest restaurant you're saving out to job live yeah that's it that's all i'm expecting.

510
00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:54.930
Faculty Office Hours: that's it.

511
00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:07.170
Clay Coleman: I assume, is it, I mean I already submitted it with the other one, I just want.

512
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:09.990
Faculty Office Hours: yeah just resubmit.

513
00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:25.440
Faculty Office Hours: Yes, yeah and if it doesn't let you like if it doesn't give you like povey or set those up for me and for some reason was set up for only one submission, let me know and i'll i'll i'll fix it and make sure you can do multiple and don't worry i'm not i'm not super like.

514
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:27.450
Clay Coleman: crazy.

515
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:28.020
Faculty Office Hours: Like.

516
00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:28.620
Clay Coleman: This is.

517
00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:29.550
Faculty Office Hours: Like one minute I.

518
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:41.460
Faculty Office Hours: know you know if you come to me like the next day and say oh man I just realized I did it wrong and already submitted i'll take it right, if I hadn't read yet doesn't matter right.

519
00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:52.470
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so i'm not super I want you guys to get your capstones done, and so I tried to make the homework fairly easy and make it educational.

520
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:55.620
Faculty Office Hours: Right try to make it.

521
00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.000
Faculty Office Hours: seem to be.

522
00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:07.470
Clay Coleman: tough, but what is it actually now see there's the iris one is this the one i'm using this one, no, no, where is it oh I moved it.

523
00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:09.750
Clay Coleman: red wine.

524
00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:11.310
hey.

525
00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:15.960
Clay Coleman: So not wait on me.

526
00:39:15.990 --> 00:39:17.880
Faculty Office Hours: You must have created that one, I think.

527
00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.560
Karen Fireman: Maybe even move.

528
00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:21.840
Faculty Office Hours: You might have created that one.

529
00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:31.320
Faculty Office Hours: yeah but see the problem looking at that that's shouldn't be your homework is that has the red wine data, so you want to you, you want to get your own data right.

530
00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:33.780
Clay Coleman: And and use your own data for the oh yeah.

531
00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:38.160
Clay Coleman: No, I did I did for that one I say i've got back no.

532
00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:42.060
Clay Coleman: I gotcha gotcha just really it's just it's just named that.

533
00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:43.260
Faculty Office Hours: yeah let's see.

534
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:46.080
Clay Coleman: So that's the one, so this is the.

535
00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:52.890
Faculty Office Hours: One that picks, this is the one I did right that's the one I think yeah I don't think I asked you in the homework don't do the whole picture thing.

536
00:39:53.220 --> 00:40:05.700
Faculty Office Hours: you're welcome to do that, I just wanted to show, I just wanted to be able to see where you were able to use pipelines and psychic learn save your model out and do it, but if you want to get fancy and do the intricate save out and all.

537
00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:06.420
Clay Coleman: That you're welcome.

538
00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:08.490
Clay Coleman: Okay right.

539
00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:22.290
Faculty Office Hours: get one pipeline and trained it and then save it and do it you're fine right, I just want to make sure that you get that little fancy pipeline syntax I just want that that dictionary there, I just want to make sure you can do that that's all alright.

540
00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:24.450
cool.

541
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:29.760
Clay Coleman: Now rename that.

542
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:31.650
Karen Fireman: How do we know that we did it.

543
00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:33.570
Karen Fireman: i'm a little wondering.

544
00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.360
Faculty Office Hours: So a clay sure your code real quick.

545
00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:37.980
Clay Coleman: Sure sure.

546
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:41.070
Karen Fireman: sure.

547
00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:43.830
Clay Coleman: I just wanted to rename it OK.

548
00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:44.550
Clay Coleman: OK.

549
00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.650
Clay Coleman: I see Rachel there's a Heidi nine.

550
00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:59.580
Faculty Office Hours: This that pipe rf Karen that pipeline, if you have that pipeline command in there, and you have a job lined load and job like dumping your code works that's all you need for the second one does that make sense.

551
00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:05.190
Karen Fireman: Well it's funny when you said I had all this checking and doing and I was like wait a minute, maybe I didn't.

552
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:07.020
Faculty Office Hours: know what he was asking is if.

553
00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:14.340
Faculty Office Hours: You look at my iris example I have open my iris example up yeah she right there, I have three pipelines I constructed.

554
00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.600
Faculty Office Hours: And then I have.

555
00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:30.450
Faculty Office Hours: That I have where I go through, and then I have identified the most accurate model, and so, then I look at I iterate through each one of these three I did up there, I iterate through them and I save how, whatever their their accuracy that kind of what their accuracy was I use that as.

556
00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:30.690
Karen Fireman: A.

557
00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:42.960
Faculty Office Hours: Bad term you know their evaluation and then, whatever one end up being the highest I mean I set that to be the best model and that's the one I save out so if you look around you the job like don't align 57 you see we're saving out best.

558
00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.520
Karen Fireman: pipeline yes.

559
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:47.070
Faculty Office Hours: And it's using the variable best pipe.

560
00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:53.850
Faculty Office Hours: and basically what i'm doing is I have for pipes and unit line 38 i'm looping through for pipe and pipelines.

561
00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.870
Faculty Office Hours: I have been.

562
00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.640
Karen Fireman: X and train the best one.

563
00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:02.820
Faculty Office Hours: For each one of those pipes and if you see pipelines, is a list of the three pipelines I built the above.

564
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:09.900
Faculty Office Hours: And then I built a dictionary, so I can oh zero is logistic regression want to support vector to his decision tree and then I looked through.

565
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:18.420
Faculty Office Hours: And that that gives me that good so that gives a look through those three with that that for loop fit in the model, and then I compare the accuracies right.

566
00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:29.970
Faculty Office Hours: Then the bottom, then the next stuff I say okay send some variables up called best pie best accuracy best seal off and then I just loop through the the pipelines.

567
00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:36.270
Faculty Office Hours: You know the models I bill and I save out and I just evaluate and if it's greater than.

568
00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:44.970
Faculty Office Hours: But if it's as I look at the first one, I set what the best accuracy is and if it's greater than best accuracy can see rest of the variable called zero dot zero for best accuracy.

569
00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:51.120
Faculty Office Hours: So I looked at the first one, of course, like the first one to look at it's going to be the only what i'm looking at that set best accuracy of the model is.

570
00:42:51.660 --> 00:43:00.600
Faculty Office Hours: Whatever it was that one so, then I get to the second one I compare it to the first one to see if the best accuracy score is and if it's greater I set my best accuracy.

571
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:03.540
Karen Fireman: Well, so that's yeah i'm with you, I understand that logic I got you down.

572
00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:15.840
Faculty Office Hours: And then, at the other day, at the end, when I look at all three best accuracy that becomes my best pipe that's the one I save out and then I pray it, you know, save blank pipeline to file best pipe so.

573
00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:20.760
Karen Fireman: Okay, I got it, but now the room and do we didn't actually have to do this, you.

574
00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.020
Faculty Office Hours: have to do that, you don't have to do.

575
00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:22.770
Karen Fireman: Okay okay.

576
00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:35.640
Faculty Office Hours: So extra credit if you did not so So if you if you go back to his want he's turned it turned and he just he has the one pipeline he fits the model he does their prediction, you know saves it out good some that's that's all I expected.

577
00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.940
Karen Fireman: we're using too much time on something that i'm sorry that wasn't.

578
00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:43.740
Faculty Office Hours: done oh you're fine, I have a feeling people have the same question okay.

579
00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:44.970
Karen Fireman: Thank you.

580
00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:53.760
Faculty Office Hours: All right, who else has questions, how much time we got left we got about 17 minutes or so.

581
00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:02.850
Christian Gover: don't forget.

582
00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:06.000
Karen Fireman: That src to make that change.

583
00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:07.620
Faculty Office Hours: Sorry.

584
00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:11.220
Karen Fireman: They have to go in that src to make the change.

585
00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.550
Faculty Office Hours: Oh yeah for homework too yeah.

586
00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:17.490
Karen Fireman: yeah what is it will run the right file.

587
00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:27.030
Christian Gover: So on homework happy covers setting up, but in docker file an image.

588
00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:41.340
Faculty Office Hours: Yes, that's what I walked through in class, so I kind of showed you how to set up a docker file so really the way I would start with homework to is is I would copy I would create a new folder called like homework to.

589
00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:52.260
Faculty Office Hours: A lot of the copy in there would be the red wine flask folder and then I would copy alongside that red wine glass folder i've i've copied the red one last test Python file.

590
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:58.620
Faculty Office Hours: right next to it, and then I read, I remain in to do with red wine to your name to your data set right.

591
00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:05.760
Faculty Office Hours: And then I would go in and open up the all those files in the red wine name it to your data set and lowercase.

592
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:22.590
Faculty Office Hours: And then, what you see as you when you look through there when you look in that red wine flats folder you're going to see the the source and folder in there and inside of there you're going to see the Python run Python script that's running for the.

593
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:34.920
Faculty Office Hours: That gets run the container started right, you also see a folder called static that has your safe file from your pickle file for when you built your model for homework one right, so you got an update that with that.

594
00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:44.100
Faculty Office Hours: And so the kind of the idea is you just go through those and then files update it to match your stuff make sure you copy in your your.

595
00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:53.880
Faculty Office Hours: Save file overriding mind and replace it with mine and then there's that test script that you can run to test it right so it's not really part of the.

596
00:45:54.870 --> 00:46:04.410
Faculty Office Hours: You know it's not part of the the container itself it's just a standalone test scripts so that we can test to make sure, once we get our container stuff set up and running.

597
00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:14.490
Faculty Office Hours: It we can test the say hey like what Karen just showed us right, where she had her, she got her container image built from the docker file or container started with the docker run command.

598
00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:27.150
Faculty Office Hours: And then, a visual studio code she went to that that that that flash test script I have out there and then she put in her parameters for her test data and she ran it and then that tested against her.

599
00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:28.680
Faculty Office Hours: Her.

600
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.260
Faculty Office Hours: model yeah Thank you Karen.

601
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:33.750
Faculty Office Hours: sorry she had her homework too.

602
00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:38.340
Karen Fireman: So you see, like this guy you which one do you want to do first.

603
00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:41.580
Faculty Office Hours: let's go straight to her to first start with homework to right there.

604
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.300
Karen Fireman: Is I took his red wine and I copied it in and I.

605
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.330
Karen Fireman: replaced the name and I called him can't cancel docker right here.

606
00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:52.380
Faculty Office Hours: And then she also copied in the flask test script right here.

607
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:54.180
Karen Fireman: right there so.

608
00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:58.560
Karen Fireman: Now i've been in most file from the first homework but this I put somewhere else later.

609
00:46:58.620 --> 00:46:59.820
Faculty Office Hours: yeah you put somewhere else later.

610
00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:02.130
Faculty Office Hours: So really at this level, you really only need.

611
00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:09.660
Faculty Office Hours: Your folders going to be your doctor or your docker image container docker file is now and then their test scripts right that makes sense.

612
00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:10.470
Karen Fireman: To hear.

613
00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:15.840
Faculty Office Hours: And so, then inside there the deploy and command script like if you if you edit those.

614
00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:18.930

Karen Fireman: glass Brian so that.

Karen Fireman: yeah okay.

656
00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:44.340

658
00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:48.090

662
00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:59.580
Faculty Office Hours: From as because yeah from homework one and that's because if you go back to that Python file Karen and.

663
00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:06.330
Faculty Office Hours: yeah right there that one right there that is using the.

664
00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:13.710
Faculty Office Hours: that's because if you scroll up here for me right there see where it says scroll down just a little bit just a little more.

665
00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:16.920
Faculty Office Hours: See, where it says APP static online 35.

666
00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:21.090
Faculty Office Hours: That APP static is a variable in that settings file tennis.

667
00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:22.320
Faculty Office Hours: Python it says.

668
00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:27.780
Faculty Office Hours: Go to the to this to the root directory and then it's a static to look through your pickle file.

669
00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:37.350
Faculty Office Hours: And then the last thing that changes if you go back to your windows explorer is you want to change your test scripts so that you can test it to go up.

670
00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:39.570
Karen Fireman: couple directories one more.

671
00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:40.920
Karen Fireman: One more yeah.

672
00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:42.900
Faculty Office Hours: So then, this is the last that bottom there.

673
00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:43.680
yeah.

674
00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:50.070
Faculty Office Hours: If you look at this file, this is the one this is not, this is not part of your docker container.

675
00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:50.850
Faculty Office Hours: This is just a.

676
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:58.710
Faculty Office Hours: test prep to test your culture, change your URL there and then you gotta change your json dumps to match your.

677
00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:03.330
Faculty Office Hours: First there was 012 or three rows of data.

678
00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:04.290
Karen Fireman: During tech.

679
00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:12.330
Faculty Office Hours: Make that matters and that's it and then you know and then what you do is once you make all these file changes you go to the command prompt right.

680
00:51:12.450 --> 00:51:12.960
Karen Fireman: Now, and go.

681
00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:14.250
Faculty Office Hours: deploy script.

682
00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:14.700
here.

683
00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:18.900
Karen Fireman: And then I did the deploy yeah.

684
00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:21.870
Karen Fireman: So you don't want to type before no I didn't go to the right directory.

685
00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:24.870
Faculty Office Hours: CD I go to the right directory to do a di are there for me Karen.

686
00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:25.350
yeah.

687
00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:36.660
Faculty Office Hours: The Dir so that's the directory that has deployed and deployed and those that so so what you want to do is, if you don't run deploy first, because you haven't.

688
00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:44.850
Faculty Office Hours: You know if you haven't deployed your your container and started it, but if you are, if you have it's already running and you got an error and you have to fix it.

689
00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:53.700
Faculty Office Hours: You can type and deploy design and deploy it and deploy it and then you can fix your already deployed you don't want to deploy Karen because you're you're you're already deployed right now.

690
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:54.660
Karen Fireman: Right right.

691
00:51:55.230 --> 00:52:05.010
Faculty Office Hours: So you're already up and running, so if you type and deploy now, it will make it go it'll it'll remove the container of the image and then you'd have to type deploy again to run it right.

692
00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:09.270
Karen Fireman: And then you can go into the explorer fine.

693
00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:14.790
Faculty Office Hours: yeah So if you go to visual studio code and you if you install the if you install the docker a.

694
00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:16.350
Faculty Office Hours: Little wheel on the bottom left there.

695
00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:17.160
yeah.

696
00:52:18.690 --> 00:52:19.050
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

697
00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:30.480
Faculty Office Hours: yeah you can see stuff running, but then like you said, if you go to your code what he's showing you there you take your test script and then you run it in your active window and should work, so if you're an announcement on air right because you have deployed right.

698
00:52:30.510 --> 00:52:31.620
Karen Fireman: yeah deployed it.

699
00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:32.430
Karen Fireman: But yeah.

700
00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:34.110
Faculty Office Hours: But if you deploy it like.

701
00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:40.410
Faculty Office Hours: Once you deploy it and it's working right, you should get a response that looks like 012 and then sometimes right.

702
00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:44.910
Faculty Office Hours: These guys that matches what your code it whatever you whatever it predicted for your data.

703
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:48.810
Karen Fireman: Right I didn't put in fresh date I just put in the same data three times.

704
00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:51.630
Faculty Office Hours: That and that is perfectly all right okay.

705
00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:56.610
Faculty Office Hours: that's perfectly fine that's Okay, so the point of this exercise is not to.

706
00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:05.370
Faculty Office Hours: that's Dr jones's class to teach you how to build value models and Python my classes to teach you how to take a bottle in Python and you built and deployed into.

707
00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:16.320
Faculty Office Hours: And microservice architectures and and and clusters and look at the data bricks and and also the teacher some devops and some and some.

708
00:53:17.970 --> 00:53:19.620
Faculty Office Hours: You know agile scrum.

709
00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:22.500
Karen Fireman: So, now that it's in here, you want to be able to see it in here.

710
00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:24.090
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so now, you see this and I.

711
00:53:24.090 --> 00:53:24.390
Karen Fireman: again.

Faculty Office Hours: Now it's up here united you see your kids.

713
00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:28.590
Faculty Office Hours: into your container running.

714
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:29.430
Faculty Office Hours: Late also.

715
00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:31.260
Karen Fireman: Right.

716
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:40.710
Christian Gover: yeah I mean, so I didn't get my test run is that, just like the definition of done just if, as long as the test script right.

717
00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:42.210
Faculty Office Hours: yeah your test run good but.

718
00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:46.740
Christian Gover: yeah Okay, I did that on the second one, and I thought there was more to do.

719
00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:47.550
Faculty Office Hours: No that's it.

720
00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:53.550
Faculty Office Hours: it's it seems simple, but it is.

721
00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:54.360
Christian Gover: I mean, it really is.

722
00:53:54.840 --> 00:54:02.070
Faculty Office Hours: You know, but it's not, as you know you got to make sure you, you know I do this on purpose, because you have something that you can use that right.

723
00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:12.150
Faculty Office Hours: And so, if six months from now, you go I don't know I set up a docker container I got that folder I typed that deploy script I know it'll work right.

724
00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:13.140
Karen Fireman: You know.

725
00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:24.240
Faculty Office Hours: So that's why package, it up and then you can go and look at your code and go Okay, I know what I didn't know because i'll tell you i've been like Oh, for you know, like I said, for almost 40 years.

726
00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:31.050
Faculty Office Hours: And you know i'll look at code, I wrote, three years ago we kind of wrote, six months ago, when I do here, how does this work.

727
00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:37.050
Karen Fireman: When when when we put in that zip file for you, we put in um.

728
00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:38.310
Faculty Office Hours: there's a take.

729
00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:42.720
Faculty Office Hours: All I do care and zip up homework to zip and send that okay.

730
00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:45.030
Faculty Office Hours: homework to zip send me that.

731
00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:54.180
Faculty Office Hours: That has the deploy deploy that has your test Python script that I that I can use to test it and that has your your.

732
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:56.550
Karen Fireman: Is your docker.

733
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:59.130
Faculty Office Hours: files and all your stuff to make it work.

734
00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:00.000
Okay cool.

735
00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:04.110
Faculty Office Hours: Think that's what I said to put in there, but i'll double check.

736
00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:06.180
Karen Fireman: It sounds like I.

737
00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:12.090
Clay Coleman: have one other question that was maybe not well it's really the docker but it's not necessarily this part of it.

738
00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:16.170
Clay Coleman: So I noticed so.

739
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:32.310
Clay Coleman: I have it, I do I mess with docker a lot of work, but I noticed that whenever I create images and containers it just continually creates a new container is there a better way to not make it make a new container every time you do like docker run.

740
00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:38.580
Faculty Office Hours: So, if you look in the deploy script you see where I stopped the container or move it.

741
00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:39.990
Clay Coleman: So if you start.

742
00:55:40.290 --> 00:55:44.010
Faculty Office Hours: painter and remove it, and then you run it again, so I can start another container up for you.

743
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:51.660
Clay Coleman: Right right right, no, no, I get that I just know that i've noticed that, like i've gone in and pruned my old containers but.

744
00:55:52.200 --> 00:56:03.480
Clay Coleman: I figured I didn't know if there was a way to like you know for atl tools and things like that that run daily, I guess, making a deploy or a script that runs and then.

745
00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:03.870
removed.

746
00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:13.320
Faculty Office Hours: And we'll talk a little about this this this week right so depends on what you're doing right so some things and actually feel about this weekend X and the following week.

747
00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:25.020
Faculty Office Hours: Well, I guess we'll talk about some clouds because some of the service, I can azure they actually will start stop the container as needed for you like they'll actually build the container run it and then shut it down and remove it automatically for you.

748
00:56:25.350 --> 00:56:25.680
Clay Coleman: So.

749
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:34.740
Faculty Office Hours: They have like Ashley has like these APP services where it's like a it's a you just deploy the Python script and then behind the scenes Microsoft.

750
00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:39.660
Faculty Office Hours: Will wrap that up into a docker container automatically for you spin it up and serve it out free the data.

751
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:47.580
Faculty Office Hours: And then you use it and then it'll automatically stopping remove it when you're not used to getting charged things like that we'll talk about that a couple of weeks, but.

752
00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:57.180
Faculty Office Hours: Typically, just depends on what you're doing because remember you know when we're talking about this, this is what we're going to cover the next couple weeks to is when we spend these containers up.

753
00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:06.870
Faculty Office Hours: You know there's no cost to you run on your laptop right, but when you get you the work into your business there's going to be a cost, whether you're running them in.

754
00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:19.140
Faculty Office Hours: docker containers on servers you have in your office and there's going to be a cost to whatever that server is and to have it running but it's going to be a fixed costs right it's gonna be like a one time cost to that, whatever that server costs June to and to manage it right.

755
00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:28.050
Faculty Office Hours: But when you're in the cloud, you know if you have containers running all the time they're going to be charging you for that cloud usage right, and so you know you make decisions around.

756
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:35.610
Faculty Office Hours: How to you might start them up use them and and stop them, and you know remove them because it might be a batch thing you do at night.

757
00:57:36.090 --> 00:57:44.760
Faculty Office Hours: And so yeah you might do kind of like the equivalent we do with deploying underplay where you start them up you do what you do and then you end deploy them and shut them down so that direct making you have cost.

758
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:54.510
Faculty Office Hours: But then it could be where you're in like a Google Amazon or a large large company where you're using these micro service docker containers to serve out your application.

759
00:57:54.810 --> 00:58:03.420
Faculty Office Hours: But let's say your Amazon, for example, and I don't know if Amazon uses Cooper daddy's and docker containers or not I know Amazon web services supports them, they can run them I don't know.

760
00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:09.780
Faculty Office Hours: If Amazon has a business does this, but if let's say they did when they that's how they gave you Amazon COM.

761
00:58:10.110 --> 00:58:20.100
Faculty Office Hours: server it out as docker containers and for all these rest services well think about black Friday versus or cyber Monday versus like say today right they're going to need.

762
00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:29.010
Faculty Office Hours: 100,000 maybe a million literally a million next capacity to handle black Friday right.

763
00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:37.890
Faculty Office Hours: And so the cool thing we're talking about this and Cooper daddy's the cool thing is is they can auto scale out and all sudden take this one docker image let's say it's a search fun some.

764
00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:45.900
Faculty Office Hours: direction for Amazon and i'm simplifying a little bit right but let's say it's just the rest service that Amazon built for searching Amazon to find something.

765
00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:58.170
Faculty Office Hours: They can take that put it we're talking about this i'm jumping ahead to over how about Thursday right, but they can put that in this docker this docker container in a Cooper daddy's cluster and massively scale it out and down and have it grow and expand to have.

766
00:58:58.290 --> 00:58:59.010
Clay Coleman: it's the same.

767
00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:06.600
Faculty Office Hours: it's the same image across multiple containers and multiple pods and Cooper daddy's and they can scale it up and down, I can auto expand and grow and you set parameters.

768
00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:16.350
Faculty Office Hours: That you can say hey you know if I get more demand scale it out in this group randy's cluttered if I if I don't have the man, I could scale it down work i'm jumping ahead but we're gonna talk about that Thursday.

769
00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:17.400
Clay Coleman: cool cool.

770
00:59:18.690 --> 00:59:19.830
Clay Coleman: yeah yeah I just.

771
00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:21.600
Faculty Office Hours: pointed this class right the whole.

772
00:59:21.930 --> 00:59:22.350
Clay Coleman: class.

773
00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:28.170
Faculty Office Hours: How does this work in the real world, how do we take what we've been learning and in school, the last four semesters.

774
00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:39.600
Faculty Office Hours: and apply it for the real, how do we take and put it in the real world, because you know you know you're not going to download the csv file building a model and then go to your boss, and say Okay, we need to predict, let me know right right my script again no.

775
00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:39.990
Clay Coleman: yeah.

776
00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:52.920
Faculty Office Hours: You want to build a little bit we'll put it in a package into an application and the cool thing about docker is, we can package our software up in this nice micro service container called docker containers docker images containers and serve them out yeah.

777
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.970
Clay Coleman: Now i've been using.

778
00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:57.720
Clay Coleman: i've been using it worked for about two months now, and it's amazing.

779
00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:58.740
Clay Coleman: we've been able to.

780
00:59:59.310 --> 00:59:59.580
Clay Coleman: I just.

781
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.130
Clay Coleman: I just feel like I know the tip of the iceberg that's.

782
01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:03.840
Clay Coleman: So trying to figure out.

783
01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:11.820
Faculty Office Hours: The probably, the more you realize right my experience, and it is a lot of times I think there's more to stuff.

784
01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:19.680
Faculty Office Hours: Since it's not as bad as it used to be, when I was first starting 20 years younger the older people that are like my age now because i'm older person that idea now it's.

785
01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:33.810
Faculty Office Hours: Like they want to make you think is this black magic box right and you'll learn some day some that I will teach you yeah so, but then you get there's like wait i've been doing that for the last 20 years like yeah you learn I got to make you think there's more to it.

786
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:38.880
Faculty Office Hours: And so what you'll keep doing it, but yeah I mean i'm joking a little bit right but.

787
01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:51.090
Faculty Office Hours: yeah you know it's it's a go or no go and we're going to talk to and that's this week on a i'm going to go over docker will more three emphasize it for some people, for people who are still you know.

788
01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:58.950
Faculty Office Hours: So you know kind of go over to get a little bit ramp you know we talked a little about docker break it down a bit more, and then go into Cooper daddy's and.

789
01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:09.870
Faculty Office Hours: How do we take what we're doing and run it and scale and you won't have a homework assignment for that, because I can't really assign you a homework assignment that will make you go try to run a service that cost several thousand dollars so but.

790
01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:25.230
Faculty Office Hours: I will show you an action and i'll show you how it works and and I have to give you the scripts and stuff to play with it, if you wanted to, and a hazard, but you know if you hear that constant little sounds of a Weber it's my three pound yorkie bothering me hello, I can hear the little.

791
01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:26.040
Little well.

792
01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:32.160
Monica A. Harwig: I guess I got a question.

793
01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:33.330
Faculty Office Hours: hey mom.

794
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:36.270
Monica A. Harwig: All right, okay so it's a basic question.

795
01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:41.070
Faculty Office Hours: You missed basic question our That was the first half of our class no.

796
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:42.480
Monica A. Harwig: joke joke yeah yeah.

797
01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:48.660
Monica A. Harwig: But okay something with homework, one only dumb question I have is the head.

798
01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:57.420
Monica A. Harwig: On the export the current environment to gamble file oh sure I did it, I mean I just did it and it's.

799
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.200
Monica A. Harwig: I mean it didn't like I put in the command in there.

800
01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:01.920
What you said.

801
01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:08.670
Monica A. Harwig: And it entered in there's just nothing it didn't really it just went back to the base the windows.

802
01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:11.400
Faculty Office Hours: 32 so yeah okay so.

803
01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:16.860
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so it dumped it in your windows system 32 what I would recommend is launcher prompt again.

804
01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:23.850
Faculty Office Hours: activate your environment again and then CD like CD to a different folder other than windows system 32.

805
01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:30.510
Faculty Office Hours: Like and then, and then you can dump it there, or you can open windows explorer go to windows system 32.

806
01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:40.140
Faculty Office Hours: And look for why ml file so because, like when you type that command and had the name the file, while if you go to if you open up windows explorer and go to like see windows system 32.

807
01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:47.700
Faculty Office Hours: Inside us see windows system 32 you're going to find the name of that file via email, and you can just copy that and just move it somewhere else.

808
01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.010
Monica A. Harwig: Okay, so.

809
01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:53.130
Faculty Office Hours: And so, if if none of that makes sense.

810
01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:55.620
Monica A. Harwig: kinda does.

811
01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:03.780
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I mean what you can do is is you can like send you your launch your kind of prompt and then you can like CD to like.

812
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:10.650
Faculty Office Hours: You know CD to C colon slash user slash your username and then like document.

813
01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:22.320
Faculty Office Hours: And then run that contacts or command and they'll dump it there, but you should go find it and in the sea or or the other thing you could do make it easier on yourself to if you can't get to see windows system 32.

814
01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:25.260
Faculty Office Hours: If you launch the kind of prompt not as administrator.

815
01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:37.590
Faculty Office Hours: You should be able to you should be able to activate your environment still and then run the contact sport command and it will dump it into a folder that's easy to get to but yeah if you look in the sea window system 32 folder it should be there.

816
01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:40.680
Monica A. Harwig: Okay, great okay that that do that.

817
01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:41.670
Faculty Office Hours: Does that make sense.

818
01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.660
Monica A. Harwig: yeah and then the other question I had was on this.

819
01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:51.810
Monica A. Harwig: What this command means on the second, so this what is conduct.

820
01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:56.310
Monica A. Harwig: End create your file name, and this is.

821
01:03:57.570 --> 01:04:00.450
Monica A. Harwig: dash and dash me, does that mean delete me.

822
01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:02.400
Faculty Office Hours: say that again.

823
01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.260
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

824
01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:14.160
Faculty Office Hours: Please delete me that was just me showing you how to the command to like hey i'm showing you how I want to create a new environment from the animal file and I was just.

825
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:22.350
Faculty Office Hours: it's it's it nerd stuff we're like it's it's when we show demos and it's so that three months from now, when I look at my environments.

826
01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:32.250
Faculty Office Hours: I won't have like another environment that I don't know what it is, and so I see tell me that needs to leave me that was just the just something I was showing from a DEMO so.

827
01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:39.060
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so basically what you like a real real more example would be like you export your current environment to gamble file.

828
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:47.820
Faculty Office Hours: And you were you would do this as like and then kind of the route and then we'll world is like I created the environment, unlike the senior developer or project.

829
01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:56.550
Faculty Office Hours: And we're dealing with Python products and I create the environment with all the right versions of packages and stuff we need I export that gamma fall, I sent it out all my peers and say hey.

830
01:04:56.790 --> 01:05:00.390
Faculty Office Hours: run this GMO file or create the environment, you need to write code, so that we're all.

831
01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:12.390
Faculty Office Hours: On the same versions of packages same version of Python and the same environment names, so that when we start deploying our code up together we're all using the same versions of stuff so that's one reason why I do this.

832
01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:21.930
Faculty Office Hours: For command the other reason would be is hey I want to clone this environment with all these same packages for another project and so like I usually named my.

833
01:05:22.410 --> 01:05:34.920
Faculty Office Hours: kinda environments based more on a project name right so let's say like red wine 36 to be doing red line quality classification and i'm using Python three six i'm a Colorado 936 is my current environment.

834
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:45.270
Faculty Office Hours: Well let's say I want to start using Python three seven, but I can take that that the mo file edit it updated to three seven update package versions and then.

835
01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:54.540
Faculty Office Hours: And then run it and call it red line 37 and now it'll recreate that environment for me or I can say hey I want to start testing the new versions of the packages.

836
01:05:54.900 --> 01:06:05.610
Faculty Office Hours: I can export out my red wine 36 to mo file and then run that condo create command with the mo follow on call it, you know you know red line 36.

837
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:12.990
Faculty Office Hours: version two or something or something right, and then I can start upgrading packages inside of that so this so I can clone my.

838
01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:19.320
Faculty Office Hours: Environment and start updating packages in there and what that does is I don't have my old environment and I have my new environment.

839
01:06:19.590 --> 01:06:27.780
Faculty Office Hours: And if something's not working right my new environment, I still have my old environment out there, with all the versions of the packages, I was using so I can keep.

840
01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:34.980
Faculty Office Hours: You know I can go back to that if I need to because what I see happening is most people don't create any environments, they work in base.

841
01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:43.440
Faculty Office Hours: And they update packages and basically always working based install new packages, the base, and then they break their stuff right, and so, by using the packaging.

842
01:06:43.770 --> 01:06:52.920
Faculty Office Hours: By using the kind of environment manager creating new environments for each one of your projects, you can control, you can control your.

843
01:06:53.460 --> 01:07:02.790
Faculty Office Hours: Your projects so that you're always using the same version packages, or if you need to go to new versions, you can take what you have clone it create a new environment from that clones that DEMO file.

844
01:07:03.930 --> 01:07:04.620
Faculty Office Hours: you're welcome Karen.

845
01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:08.070
Monica A. Harwig: Okay, great well that makes perfect sense I appreciate it.

846
01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:09.240
Faculty Office Hours: yeah no worries.

847
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:13.200
Karen Fireman: He put up the the upload for the number two.

848
01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:14.400
Faculty Office Hours: Is they're not there.

849
01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:17.790
Karen Fireman: Nine and see it and i'll say you're giving away 10 points for free right.

850
01:07:17.790 --> 01:07:18.120
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

851
01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:21.840
Faculty Office Hours: I did that, last year I just really glad you pointed out, the.

852
01:07:21.870 --> 01:07:32.400
Faculty Office Hours: template for free, I totally you know, last year I did the same thing and I, and I totally forgot, and so I forgot to update the I forgot to update the the grading system.

853
01:07:32.610 --> 01:07:33.600
Karen Fireman: So you get certainly like.

854
01:07:34.170 --> 01:07:37.110
Karen Fireman: it's like the SAP she got 200 points for me.

855
01:07:37.410 --> 01:07:42.030
Faculty Office Hours: yeah yeah hey hey Mr you want say hi to everybody say.

856
01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:47.400
Faculty Office Hours: Let me, let me get the camera on so y'all can say hi misty here let's put misty.

857
01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:50.940
Faculty Office Hours: To hi miss miss he's like i've been home all day because.

858
01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:51.840
Faculty Office Hours: My dad.

859
01:07:52.830 --> 01:07:56.430
Faculty Office Hours: My dad went to work for the first time, and since.

860
01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:57.450
Faculty Office Hours: Kofi just.

861
01:07:57.690 --> 01:07:58.710
Karen Fireman: Work for the first time.

862
01:07:59.160 --> 01:07:59.850
Faculty Office Hours: To the office.

863
01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:00.480
Faculty Office Hours: To the office.

864
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:01.680
Karen Fireman: that's what I mean yeah.

865
01:08:02.010 --> 01:08:02.550
Karen Fireman: Yes.

866
01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:09.240
Faculty Office Hours: Oh wow yeah it was just because we had all day meeting and they're like hey some of us are people been going into the offices like.

867
01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:11.460
Faculty Office Hours: A while ago, like some.

868
01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:13.650
Karen Fireman: PP nice if they waited till we all got shots but.

869
01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:16.980
Faculty Office Hours: yeah we it's no one's there right and so it's.

870
01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:25.950
Faculty Office Hours: it's a you know we're all kind of separated right so, and so I needed fixing all right, no, no, no.

871
01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:29.280
Karen Fireman: cutie you okay well thanks i'm going to drop off Thank you.

872
01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:29.940
guys.

873
01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.860
Christian Gover: Say don't don't leave, yet I had a question.

874
01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:38.010
Christian Gover: On the last one here now.

875
01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:49.380
Christian Gover: yeah yeah so on the neural network stuff yeah I was wondering how the charisse neural network.

876
01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:51.810
Christian Gover: comparison to the jump one.

877
01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:55.410
Faculty Office Hours: your mother should not.

878
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:59.370
Karen Fireman: listen to you later i'm going to listen to the.

879
01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:01.290
Faculty Office Hours: recordings or.

880
01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:04.020
Karen Fireman: The recording hey thanks goodbye.

881
01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:05.130
goodbye.

882
01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:10.440
Faculty Office Hours: All right, sorry one second.

883
01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.060
Christian Gover: No worries.

884
01:09:15.510 --> 01:09:16.470
Faculty Office Hours: Getting rid of the dogs.

885
01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:25.200
Faculty Office Hours: alright.

886
01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:28.620
Christian Gover: you're not kicking no.

887
01:09:29.610 --> 01:09:37.200
Faculty Office Hours: No, no she's crazy she's like she's she's she's aggravating the the other one.

888
01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.890
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so go ahead and i'm sorry.

889
01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:44.610
Christian Gover: yeah yeah so I was wondering how the the.

890
01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:52.500
Christian Gover: tensorflow neural network comparison and performance to the jump neural network.

891
01:09:53.130 --> 01:10:01.140
Faculty Office Hours: yeah and I don't haven't really played a lot with either one i'm, to be honest with you i'm not a neural net expert per se and I had to build some of them.

892
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:15.150
Faculty Office Hours: And I haven't i've never really played a lot with the jump ones, yet Dr Jones to be the person who really asked that question I don't know how much he's done with a jump but you know you, you have to here's here's the thing jump is a great tool right.

893
01:10:15.570 --> 01:10:24.750
Faculty Office Hours: yeah but john's going to be limited, not going to answer the this because I do know this right so jump is gonna be limited to what neural net since doing.

894
01:10:25.710 --> 01:10:29.220
Faculty Office Hours: With charisse tensorflow, you have the whole.

895
01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:38.490
Faculty Office Hours: package of pipe on to do all kinds of different neural nets deeper, and you know recurrent neural nets convolution neural nets, this one we're doing here is just a simple sequential.

896
01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:46.980
Faculty Office Hours: You know dense kind of kind of similar what you see like enterprise monitor on that price similar to jump So these are probably similar in.

897
01:10:47.970 --> 01:10:58.800
Faculty Office Hours: in scope, you know this one I forgot my mind has offered how many layers I have right and drop outs and stuff and so in jump they're giving you the capabilities to build some neural nets.

898
01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:05.400
Faculty Office Hours: But you know you only have so many layers you can do forget it's been a while, since I played with a jump in there on that interface right.

899
01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:15.060
Faculty Office Hours: But you know they have to scope it down to an interface, where you put some parameters in it running right, whereas with Paris tensorflow you can do.

900
01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:20.490
Faculty Office Hours: an unlimited amount of different types of things depend on how much computing processing power.

901
01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:30.270
Faculty Office Hours: And things like you have right, and so you can start really coding in your own type of algorithms using their libraries to do that right so it's the difference between you know, having.

902
01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:41.550
Faculty Office Hours: Complete code access to do what you need to a canned application where somebody has to write the code in the background, gives you an interface to put into parameters and run it right so.

903
01:11:41.610 --> 01:11:45.750
Christian Gover: yeah that's what I felt like the junk I didn't have very many options to pick.

904
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:47.340
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I think jump it's just.

905
01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:53.490
Faculty Office Hours: A pretty active look at the documentation I haven't looked at a couple years I mean or probably like a year and a half or two.

906
01:11:53.940 --> 01:12:01.860
Faculty Office Hours: I haven't looked at the documentation, but my guess is they're pretty straight forward cal artificial neural nets with just certain amount of layers.

907
01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:07.320
Faculty Office Hours: You know and and I don't know if they're if they're back propagation or things like that right so.

908
01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:22.080
Faculty Office Hours: Now I forget I have rest with this, you know we can set dropouts back replication we can do recurrent neural nets, we can do you know convolution neural nets know in so we have all these capabilities, because we have full access to the code right.

909
01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:36.330
Christian Gover: yeah i'm just thinking i'm wondering if it's worth trying out the curious one because for my caps I use the jump neural network and i'm trying to improve my MIC and so.

910
01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:38.160
Faculty Office Hours: So here's what I would suggest right.

911
01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:49.350
Faculty Office Hours: So you know we're going to be having to get your capstone turns in here shortly right So if you don't have your presentation tied up are ready to go do that first.

912
01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:59.040
Faculty Office Hours: And if at the once you have that ready if you still have week or two or time and you want to play with doing the doing this kind of I gave you.

913
01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:04.230
Faculty Office Hours: And play with it and see if you can build a better model with it knock yourself out right.

914
01:13:06.210 --> 01:13:09.900
Faculty Office Hours: You know I don't want to happen is have you start trying to play with this.

915
01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:22.320
Faculty Office Hours: And then, all sudden you're like oh shoot I got three days I had to get my my presentation together they're like Why would you been doing that was trying to get Dr your Professor john says, I love doctor Professor johnston's code working.

916
01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:26.310
Faculty Office Hours: And then admire me why are they tried it, I was like oh.

917
01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:43.650
Christian Gover: i'm just trying to improve what you know what I submitted it was back in like May of last year, I was in a data science challenge so i'm just trying to like improve on on my submission, I came in fifth just by submitting a jump neural network.

918
01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:45.720
Faculty Office Hours: that's pretty cool.

919
01:13:45.810 --> 01:14:02.820
Christian Gover: yeah, but I would like to try some of this stuff out but that that makes sense to try to finish up the presentation first and then come back, because I can get lost doing all this like configuration and figuring out like what what's the optimal parameters to set for this neural network.

920
01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:05.310
Faculty Office Hours: Oh.

921
01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:07.920
Faculty Office Hours: yeah yeah you see i'm coming from like.

922
01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:18.180
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I don't want I said I would get your presentation together, because if you've got your day then you've done your data wrangling and your data massaging.

923
01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:30.420
Faculty Office Hours: And feature engineering and you know data discovery and then you know, then a model building and everything and you're like I got 67% accuracy, whatever you have right.

924
01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:31.890
Faculty Office Hours: Now i'm just happy.

925
01:14:32.010 --> 01:14:42.420
Faculty Office Hours: that's not a problem right we're not gonna let you go and try to do your capstone I don't know no one's gonna take a look at you know all your models only this right, the data is what it is, you know and sometimes you're just not going to be able to get.

926
01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:49.680
Faculty Office Hours: A great model of the data, you have right and that's just that's just life right and how we do these things, you know.

927
01:14:50.190 --> 01:14:58.800
Faculty Office Hours: And so, but you know we your your capstone stuff doing a few weeks right like about them less less than a month like three four weeks, maybe.

928
01:14:59.130 --> 01:15:05.100
Christian Gover: it's not that you have the first thing is do well, I think that he is doing the 21st of March.

929
01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:05.550
Christian Gover: Yes, and.

930
01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:07.230
Christian Gover: submit the whole thing.

931
01:15:07.290 --> 01:15:08.220
Faculty Office Hours: yeah yeah so you got about a.

932
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.570
Faculty Office Hours: month.

933
01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:10.890
Christian Gover: it's about five weeks right.

934
01:15:11.130 --> 01:15:24.060
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so you know if you've already got like some stuff he doesn't jump and you got some things in your in your and your and you know you know and you've been working with your capstone coach you know I would get that get that presentation put together.

935
01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:33.450
Faculty Office Hours: And then, if you want to start playing with you know the code, I gave you to do it then go ahead, you know and yeah five weeks it doesn't take that long to put together a PowerPoint.

936
01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:41.370
Faculty Office Hours: So you know it might be worth taking a week or so and playing with this, but don't you don't don't wait too long right.

937
01:15:42.570 --> 01:15:42.960
Christian Gover: Right.

938
01:15:43.050 --> 01:15:48.450
Faculty Office Hours: That makes sense, I mean that that's my that's my are you in DR Jones is quite a collective.

939
01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:49.590
Christian Gover: Correct yeah.

940
01:15:49.650 --> 01:15:51.240
Faculty Office Hours: I mean, I thought I thought you were.

941
01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:58.410
Faculty Office Hours: yeah that's really good like second half of the classes are going to be just around like tensorflow and all that he's he's super smart.

942
01:15:58.680 --> 01:15:59.790
Faculty Office Hours: yeah anyway so i'm in.

943
01:15:59.790 --> 01:16:00.120
Christian Gover: kind of.

944
01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:08.340
Faculty Office Hours: A neural net he, like he writes his own like neural nets and c++ right oh yeah he's super brilliant like I know when I was.

945
01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:19.230
Faculty Office Hours: School he he taught us, the only cause of summer, when I was the only taught the summer classes saying what you guys took and we didn't have the Python part of that the summer class we just had enterprise minor right and.

946
01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:22.380
Faculty Office Hours: And he he.

947
01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:23.940
Faculty Office Hours: He.

948
01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:29.490
Faculty Office Hours: yeah he was like yeah i'm working on this project with the health back and talk a lot about yeah we're still working on.

949
01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:41.340
Faculty Office Hours: This one, because when kids have epilepsy, and during their sleep and he was just talking about because we're talking about building like logistical aggressions and specificity and sensitivity and.

950
01:16:41.670 --> 01:16:48.270
Faculty Office Hours: You know rock you know rock curves and all that and just talking about like when you're building a vise like that you're you're okay with with.

951
01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:58.020
Faculty Office Hours: Your your Okay, have you know false positives aren't necessarily bad right right good you run in there and it says your kids having a seizure and galleries town asleep that's not a bad thing.

952
01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:03.390
Faculty Office Hours: But you don't want false negatives like you want to wake up in the morning, oh yeah it was a sleepless night yeah.

953
01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:12.570
Faculty Office Hours: We slept the whole night the kid never had an epileptic seizure you get the kids on the bed, you know he had three features that night because the device or building the.

954
01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:17.640
Faculty Office Hours: model, you know predictive negatives, when I was positive right, so he was like he was talking about.

955
01:17:18.150 --> 01:17:31.440
Faculty Office Hours: When he was working on this with one of the big health firms, he was writing the Code, the the actual software code and like c++ or whatever you know are bringing you know per night and see you probably some lower level language than that.

956
01:17:32.370 --> 01:17:43.740
Faculty Office Hours: For the for the actual you know the actual algorithm that are doing so yeah he's he's done a lot of our other he was he was give showed us some websites, when I was in class the two different things, but yeah that's pretty funny.

957
01:17:44.730 --> 01:17:47.730
Christian Gover: Okay, so he'd be the guy that asked about optimizing.

958
01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:50.010
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I would definitely I would definitely.

959
01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:55.950
Faculty Office Hours: yeah if you start getting really questions about tensorflow it optimize it hit him up he yeah he's you know.

960
01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:01.140
Faculty Office Hours: I know a little bit about it but i'm not a super super expert on that kind of stuff.

961
01:18:02.430 --> 01:18:04.260
Faculty Office Hours: pipelines and all around teaching you.

962
01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:08.280
Faculty Office Hours: This is what I do for a living, and you know i'm good at this part.

963
01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:12.840
Faculty Office Hours: I don't do that you know if you said hey here's a date I need you to build me an algorithm and.

964
01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:17.100
Faculty Office Hours: And and and and tensorflow I could build you one right.

965
01:18:18.180 --> 01:18:32.280
Faculty Office Hours: But yeah it's have to sit down and work it out and work out the code, I can do it's not a problem I have done it, but when you start getting into like you want real some real good if I saw it for people, I know, Dr Jones just go.

966
01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:39.420
Christian Gover: Okay, all right i'll ask him, and do you have you don't have an example on on a network that predicts.

967
01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:41.670
Christian Gover: Like the quantities, instead of.

968
01:18:41.730 --> 01:18:44.700
Faculty Office Hours: categories actually I mean.

969
01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:50.910
Faculty Office Hours: I mean what i'm doing right now, you can tell what up that when.

970
01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:53.790
Faculty Office Hours: I have to look at this.

971
01:18:54.090 --> 01:18:57.120
Christian Gover: i'm kind of changing careers and i'm running into.

972
01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:00.900
Christian Gover: columns where i'm having to change, like the last functions and all that stuff.

973
01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:02.880
Faculty Office Hours: began, you probably do that you also you.

974
01:19:03.570 --> 01:19:11.490
Faculty Office Hours: If you go look your school look out there for some examples like for like regresses for yes for versus classification and see if.

975
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:17.790
Faculty Office Hours: you're not going to want hot code your data right that's that's that's part of the class you're not going over one hot and Caribbean data right.

976
01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:28.980
Faculty Office Hours: To remove remove those lines, but they have some pretty decent examples out there on the tensorflow Harris, especially since tensorflow to dotto came out with your with the careless built into it.

977
01:19:29.190 --> 01:19:30.990
Faculty Office Hours: it's a lot used to be right.

978
01:19:31.530 --> 01:19:41.460
Faculty Office Hours: And so that and i've done a lot better job with their documentation is like the one i'm showing you I just model P, I kind of modified some examples already out there to use my data right.

979
01:19:41.970 --> 01:19:49.860
Faculty Office Hours: And so what I would do is just kind of go out to Google tensorflow documentation I think they have some pretty decent examples you could probably pull for what you're trying to do.
