Capstone Coach 1: Alright, so the recordings running now.

4
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.440
Capstone Coach 1: All right, what about.

5
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.520
Capstone Coach 1: Any questions about the class lecture on Tuesday.

6
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.540
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

7
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.480
Capstone Coach 1: yeah I.

8
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:53.730
Capstone Coach 1: think we had most of the covered on the second week lecture there and so let's then get into talking about the the homework example.

9
00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:05.760
Capstone Coach 1: homework problem rather and I need to crank up if you haven't already done so, go ahead and start spire Oh well, first thing that i'm going to do is share my screen hang on.

10
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.000
Capstone Coach 1: Let me go back to soon here.

11
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.310
Capstone Coach 1: and

12
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.760
Capstone Coach 1: share my screen.

13
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.120
Capstone Coach 1: The sky should do it right.

14
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.720
here.

15
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.020
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

16
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.050
Capstone Coach 1: well.

17
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.420
Capstone Coach 1: It says i'm sharing my screen is that right.

18
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.330
Capstone Coach 1: Can you see the the.

19
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.220
Capstone Coach 1: sort of a Python looking screen there.

20
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.800
Capstone Coach 1: Yes, okay okay.

21
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.650
Capstone Coach 1: that's funny it doesn't well it doesn't show me it because I can see it right.

22
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.740
Capstone Coach 1: So i'm going to.

23
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.670
Capstone Coach 1: Open up one of them.

24
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:07.230
Capstone Coach 1: gooey so we did it at the end of the class last time I think that's a good place to start if you're working on this homework problem and so i'm going to open and then this cold.

25
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.900
Capstone Coach 1: plot gooey I think it's called.

26
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.670
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, see.

27
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.420
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

28
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.850
Capstone Coach 1: it's in here.

29
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.080
Capstone Coach 1: So these are the files that are in the week to folder if you go to the week to folder.

30
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:43.830
Capstone Coach 1: And, which is this is what you'd find on the campus So if you go on the week to folder and you look at the.

31
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:52.980
Capstone Coach 1: lecture code files there's a directory there there's one file, in particular, that would be the last one that we talked about in that lecture.

32
00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:04.890
Capstone Coach 1: And it's labeled as there are two versions here there's one called plot ui template you can see that up here, this is the template that choose to build this going.

33
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.990
Capstone Coach 1: and

34
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.710
Capstone Coach 1: You know if you have time, I would recommend that you go over that part of the lecture and rebuild this.

35
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.100
Capstone Coach 1: ui that we're going to look at right here i'm going to show you the easy way to do the homework, first of all.

36
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:33.810
Capstone Coach 1: And then I recommend that you explore beyond what we're going to look at, but this is the value of one open up in spider black goo E dot P, why now i'm going to open that up here just a second.

37
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.240
Capstone Coach 1: And of course the the actual homework assignment.

38
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:53.400
Capstone Coach 1: is also in week two it's here under week two assignments and i'm going to click on that you should get a picture of what we want the going to look like something like that.

39
00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:18.000
Capstone Coach 1: And let me open that up a little bit, because I think this is a good place to start is this this this APP that you have in the folder plot gooey it does everything in here, except this little upper right area that i'm pointing to right here so.

40
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:28.350
Capstone Coach 1: let's go through the plot gui and you'll see what i'm talking about so i'm going back to spider and i'm going to open up that file plot gooey.

41
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:45.360
Capstone Coach 1: right there and i'd like you to do the same, I mean if you have spider open in your computer, this would be good, because, basically, I think, by the time we get through here, you may have your homework done okay I don't want to make it too easy, but this is not really a.

42
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.760
Capstone Coach 1: I you know you should be able to do this homework assignment about an hour.

43
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.560
Capstone Coach 1: And so, here we go we're opening up this block.

44
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.870
Capstone Coach 1: right here.

45
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:08.220
Capstone Coach 1: And i'm going to going to make the image, a little larger so be easier for you to see what's going on.

46
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.740
Capstone Coach 1: I hope you could see that.

47
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.360
Capstone Coach 1: All right.

48
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:25.920
Capstone Coach 1: Make that little bigger is, can you read that code on my screen, or is it too small for you okay great Elizabeth all right.

49
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.310
Good.

50
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.440
Capstone Coach 1: hands up today.

51
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.730
Capstone Coach 1: i'm going to start wearing a hat I like that hat Richard.

52
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:52.590
Capstone Coach 1: You know that's what the you can do with these online services, you get real goofy right i'm going to start getting goofy because I feel like going crazy we're in these stupid masks and at least now i'm got the space shield that I they're letting me wearing class and.

53
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.850
Capstone Coach 1: Jim was there, so he can back me up on this there's plenty of room and class.

54
00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:13.530
Capstone Coach 1: And you may hear me refer to it as healthy distance instead of social distance and Mexico, they don't call it social distance that because there's nothing social about it.

55
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:22.440
Capstone Coach 1: So in Mexico, the translation is healthy distance or sanitary distances you'll see it in there, so.

56
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.520
Capstone Coach 1: what's the goop day you've got to you've got a.

Capstone Coach 1: All right, all right, what a cute kid okay.

67
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.750
Capstone Coach 1: We have a new kid in the family who's about.

68
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:08.640
Capstone Coach 1: Your sons are these a son.

69
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.620
Capstone Coach 1: Is a.

70
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:25.230
Capstone Coach 1: So young daughter, I like to show you a picture God she's cute you know unbelievable Nice, you know she's blue eyes and all that sort of thing really, really attracted little girl.

71
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:32.460
Capstone Coach 1: Anyway, distracted distracted I anybody brings a class to class we're going to have to get distracted.

72
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.510
Capstone Coach 1: I love these little children as long as you're not mine okay.

73
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:45.000
Capstone Coach 1: Of course i've got a daughter, who takes up a lot of my extra time.

74
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:59.700
Capstone Coach 1: What time I just so let's get started, your postpone this let's uh let's take the plot ui that we have here on our screen and let's just click run up here and see what we get, and so there is.

75
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:06.120
Capstone Coach 1: there's what you have now I don't know that I can make this any larger I think that's.

76
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:16.650
Capstone Coach 1: The gooey is there are ways to make the gooey respond to opening and closing like this, so that it will get actually gets larger or smaller.

77
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:28.980
Capstone Coach 1: As you change the gooey, but this is not one of we haven't gone that far yet, and I hope to get to that talking about how that's done maybe next week we'll see.

78
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:44.370
Capstone Coach 1: So what this does everything that we talked about in class we started out by building the upper left hand part of the grid, this is when you're looking at a gui like this, you can see it's actually a grid right.

79
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:59.490
Capstone Coach 1: So this grid the the entire canvas here is divided into a grid, so I have 1234 columns you see the the the three and four sided sneak.

80
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.560
Capstone Coach 1: sneak in right over here stop FAB okay.

81
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:25.080
Capstone Coach 1: And then, if you look at the number of rows i've got 123456 that separator line is a row seven and then, then the last one, where you see these these check buttons that's eight, so I have eight rows there.

82
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:36.690
Capstone Coach 1: Everything is got to go into a column or and row and so when you're designing a gui like this sometimes what you'll do is take just take a piece of paper.

83
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:47.940
Capstone Coach 1: and think about what to do you know kind of sketch out what you want it to look like and then imagine, where each one of those elements is going in terms of each element has to go into a row, and a column.

84
00:09:48.630 --> 00:10:10.890
Capstone Coach 1: Now some elements can span rose or columns which means they can fill up more than one column, for example here the separator line is actually spanning four columns 123 and four sacks we spanning four columns and you can also span rose, if you like.

85
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:33.930
Capstone Coach 1: This this area we're going to put something over in the upper right over here that's your assignment right, so this is this stop that's going up here is going to span these columns these rows rather 123456 rows and also one or two columns today.

86
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:43.410
Capstone Coach 1: So if I wanted to come, all the way out here and that's what's shown in the picture i'm going to have to span two columns, this is actually two columns right here.

87
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:54.390
Capstone Coach 1: So we're gonna we're going to learn something that's very useful, which is how do you put a frame into a gooey that frame is going in right here.

88
00:10:54.900 --> 00:11:05.670
Capstone Coach 1: When you put another frame into a frame there's already one frame here that's the main frame that's that's all of the space right now is the mainframe.

89
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:20.880
Capstone Coach 1: except for a few pixels on the Left and the Right and the top and the bottom little padding but all of this inside the canvas is is the mainframe you can add other frames, as many as you'd like.

90
00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:31.680
Capstone Coach 1: And you can nest them so we're going to create a frame in the upper right that's formally is going to be nested within the mainframe.

91
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:43.260
Capstone Coach 1: that's where that's going to work, but for now let me show you there are some features in this APP that are you if you look at the APP the code it's long right.

92
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:56.940
Capstone Coach 1: I mean i'm going to show you this here and go back and look at this, I mean right now we're sitting that 323 rows in the version that i've got I hope it's the same one years.

93
00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:08.820
Capstone Coach 1: But you can see there's a lot of code here now most of this is kind of boring stuff like plot close blood volume but notice it's all the same.

94
00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:14.010
Capstone Coach 1: These are the functions that if you if you click on.

95
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:17.490
Capstone Coach 1: One of these.

96
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:27.060
Capstone Coach 1: Which is when you click on one of these you're basically requesting a plot of either the adjusted close the closing price or the volume.

97
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:47.010
Capstone Coach 1: And notice it didn't give me a fly when I click there because it says oh this symbol not found so there's some extra code to do capture that symbol missing and what happens is is if it's missing it clears it out see what it did it cleared it out or.

98
00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:49.470
Karen Fireman: The question is, can.

99
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:58.860
Karen Fireman: be a reason we're not getting any canvas to show up when we click with me Let me run this because i'm not getting any canvas whatsoever, I mean it's.

100
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.680
Capstone Coach 1: it's trying to hear you're not getting this to show up.

101
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.200
Karen Fireman: Correct nothing showing up does anybody else have to say.

102
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:10.590
Capstone Coach 1: yeah know what happens is when you run spider This shows up underneath your spider screen.

103
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.570
Karen Fireman: But I moved it there's nothing there.

104
00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.540
Capstone Coach 1: Do you have more than one monitor.

105
00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:24.390
Capstone Coach 1: Yes, it's there okay now look I could show you on this screen, if you look in the bottom right in the you know, the list of stuff that's running.

106
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:28.230
Capstone Coach 1: yeah yeah look for like a blank page.

107
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.160
Karen Fireman: you're right, I feel that you're right, I had looked at it and see it now I got it Thank you.

108
00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:33.600
Capstone Coach 1: If you click.

109
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.340
Karen Fireman: The second monitor yeah.

110
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:42.270
Capstone Coach 1: that's what I do so i'm going to like i'm gonna shut this down and then, if I rerun.

111
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:42.570
Karen Fireman: It.

112
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:45.240
Capstone Coach 1: You can see here it's running okay.

113
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:57.270
Capstone Coach 1: So in the in the eye I console the Little Red dot appears with says so i'm running on doing something and then, if I want to see the gooey I can click that this little.

114
00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:18.660
Capstone Coach 1: Page part of my icon down here at the bottom and it comes to the front that's what I do Okay, so I when I started and sometimes just sticking a tricky because you may not have closed it and he's still be running and now you're trying to do it again like right now, if I click run.

115
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:39.270
Capstone Coach 1: see it disappears and nothing happens, though, is because it's still running see the red.up here and and then notice that they have this little green message and on the icon soul, and this is an indication that it's still running now when I close it.

116
00:14:41.370 --> 00:15:00.510
Capstone Coach 1: you'll see that the green message goes away, and now I just have a little cursor or little invitation here and the red dot this turns to grey so I look at this stuff fit over on the right hand side to remind me whether it is or is not running.

117
00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:03.270
Capstone Coach 1: And there there's a.

118
00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.690
Karen Fireman: Green means it's not running any more red means it is running.

119
00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:13.650
Capstone Coach 1: yeah if this is red something's running right So if I get run again.

120
00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:15.420
Capstone Coach 1: Wait a minute.

121
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:27.210
Capstone Coach 1: You hit run there we go, you see, you see the Little Red it turned red so it's running but where is it it's behind everything so hiding, so I.

122
00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:38.880
Capstone Coach 1: click down here and it brings it up and then I can move it around like that now, if I go into spider it disappears so i'm working in spider but if I click that icon it's still there.

123
00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:58.710
Capstone Coach 1: Now, I do have to screen, so I can move this out of this screen and look at it, on the other one kanye and watch what's happening, but yeah you can make changes to your code now those changes will not affect the guru is running until you shut it down and then run it again.

124
00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:00.450
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

125
00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:12.240
Capstone Coach 1: So let's uh let's look at this and show you some of the behavior that's programmed in here, first of all.

126
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:28.470
Capstone Coach 1: And then very top part of the code, this is where you actually in this top part, this is where you design the gooey and you'll notice the imports do include that one right, the bottom line number of.

127
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.540
Capstone Coach 1: that's the required import in order to bring an image.

128
00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:46.800
Capstone Coach 1: And then of course we have important number 14 line 14 which brings in matt plot live, which allows us to actually produce the image and then we have.

129
00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:49.260
Capstone Coach 1: T.

130
00:16:50.640 --> 00:17:00.330
Capstone Coach 1: kempter tinder Okay, you know i've been debating about the the pronunciation of this cheek enter or what have you.

131
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:14.700
Capstone Coach 1: And then I read a little bit more about where this came from, and the idea was they were going to take the tk library, which is the original library.

132
00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:35.850
Capstone Coach 1: That tk library is used, not just in Python but in CC sharp Java whenever you anybody's doing a good chances are they're using the tk library now, the problem with a tk library is that it's the documentation is like 160 some pages.

133
00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.240
Capstone Coach 1: Each of the widgets that are there.

134
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:50.310
Capstone Coach 1: are complicated and difficult sometimes to figure out what to do, or what it's going to do now, if you make movies, all the time you get used to it and so it's not a big deal.

135
00:17:50.700 --> 00:18:09.960
Capstone Coach 1: So I was doing this in Java some years ago and it wasn't you know you do it all the time that doesn't bother you but T the people got together somebody got together and Python and said let's make a subset of a different version of tk let's let's wrap tk in the library.

136
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:21.540
Capstone Coach 1: To make it easy for us to easier for us to do a gooey and that's where Tiki Tiki enter whether to tinker.

137
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:31.560
Capstone Coach 1: came from no I think what they wanted to do was calling kind tk tk kind, it was a little bit kinder.

138
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:48.480
Capstone Coach 1: For people to use, so my theory is that's where that where that came from, and they said well T kinder Well, no, no, no tk kinder now how about this is really cute right T kenter or painter you know.

139
00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:59.760
Capstone Coach 1: So something like that is where I think that my theory is that's where the name came from so i'm going to remember it now there's a D missing but it's same idea.

140
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:13.230
Capstone Coach 1: Now so let's take a look, and we did this in class yesterday, first of all, this first this the stuff that you have at the top, right here is standard.

141
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:27.660
Capstone Coach 1: code which basically is saying Okay, I have the canvas you know, so the canvas is being passed down and this particular code it's being counted fast and we're under the name gooey wi yeah.

142
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:47.220
Capstone Coach 1: And because this is something that you don't you want to put into a class you rename it or you actually create another copy of the canvas and that copy is going to be put in this variable called G when underscore.

143
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:55.920
Capstone Coach 1: To really differentiate with change between G when, which is the original canvas that was passed in.

144
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.450
Capstone Coach 1: So this sort of protects the original canvas from.

145
00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:14.760
Capstone Coach 1: Whatever the user is doing the user may take that original canvas and give it to somebody else and you don't want the things to get too confused right, so they may actually be pumping out more than one good all right.

146
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:26.160
Capstone Coach 1: So they may use the same canvas for both goalies, though, you have to make sure that when you're and you're going, and then the gooey that you're working on that.

147
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:33.270
Capstone Coach 1: You actually create another copy of it, and that is going to be called G when underscore.

148
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:55.230
Capstone Coach 1: The word self here period self period says this variable is going to be inside the class and will not be visible to normally be visible to people to code that's outside of the class, so the user, will not be able to normally to be able to see.

149
00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.680
Capstone Coach 1: The variables that have self in front of them.

150
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:14.520
Capstone Coach 1: They are not exposed outside of the class but inside the class when I call a function like right here stock clothes you notice the word itself is appearing as a as the input to that function.

151
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:29.400
Capstone Coach 1: that's because I want this function to have access to all of the variables that that are identified to be inside the class and they start then with the prefix s self period.

152
00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:42.780
Capstone Coach 1: Also, when I created it very oh no one will notice here, and the first thing that's doing it says self period symbol that's that entry box, the symbol entry box get.

153
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:56.220
Capstone Coach 1: Get what's in the symbol entry box if there's empty the there is no symbol so issue a warning and get out of here so you'll see here, it says warning symbol missing.

154
00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:00.240
Capstone Coach 1: And it says, then it says clear all of the entries because.

155
00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:11.220
Capstone Coach 1: This is just confusing and and then get out of here returned back to the main function, the main going OK.

156
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:16.740
Capstone Coach 1: So the word itself is is an indicator that you're looking at a variable that was created.

157
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:32.220
Capstone Coach 1: Inside the class only available in the class and when you call a function in a class normally the first argument you can have multiple arguments, but oftentimes you just have that one argument which is self.

158
00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:48.510
Capstone Coach 1: Like you could see here, and then you can have more arguments fast, and if you want to, or you need to but it's normally you just see people passing in the variables that are within the class so.

159
00:22:49.500 --> 00:23:05.700
Capstone Coach 1: plot close self Okay, and then it says self dot C set one now this turns out to be one of those buttons the cloud the button that relates to the closing plot at the bottom of the gooey self dot V is the bottom that.

160
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:15.930
Capstone Coach 1: refers to the volume, so, if you look at the ui here self dot C is talking about this closing price right here.

161
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:30.990
Capstone Coach 1: Self dot V is the volume and then self a C is the adjusted clothes and you notice what it says set one or 01 means put a checkmark on that on that box and the zero means remove it.

162
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:40.590
Capstone Coach 1: If there is one there remove it clear it so this makes sure that when I bought on when I click on one of these only that.

163
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:48.420
Capstone Coach 1: button is receives a check and if the check is in one of the other buttons it's going to be cleared.

164
00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:58.620
Capstone Coach 1: So, for example, here, we will do this at IBM, and now I can click on closing price right here.

165
00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:12.030
Capstone Coach 1: And there it is it comes up by the way, notice that it also shows up in the window on the right, but mainly It shows up inside the gallery, right here now, if I click on volume.

166
00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.960
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, the graph changes notice that little check on closing price disappeared.

167
00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:41.820
Capstone Coach 1: So if that's the purpose of the little functions that you see down here, because what happens is, if you look up where I created these buttons and now, this is the top of the gooey here you're doing the labels right here you're doing the the injury is symbol entry.

168
00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:44.250
Capstone Coach 1: and

169
00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:50.220
Capstone Coach 1: notice it says tea entry, which is what Karen was asking about why the tea.

170
00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:53.850
Capstone Coach 1: And I think that's because.

171
00:24:55.080 --> 00:25:04.680
Capstone Coach 1: Probably T I would guess now probably tk has an entry variable and the key here is to refer to teak enter.

172
00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:10.260
Capstone Coach 1: Make sure that oh we're in to enter and not in tk.

173
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.180
Capstone Coach 1: Oh, a lot of confusion when you start using this.

174
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:32.430
Capstone Coach 1: Now, if we go down to the buttons and you can see, this is where the separator is created row number seven that that's the line right and the column span is for saying that this separator is going to spend four columns.

175
00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.270
Capstone Coach 1: And then down here.

176
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.280
Capstone Coach 1: let's see.

177
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:52.860
Capstone Coach 1: yeah here are those little check buttons been set up each check button has a variable associated with it, which is a different name than the check button itself.

178
00:25:53.640 --> 00:26:11.490
Capstone Coach 1: And that you'll see it here, it says variable variable equal to, and that's the variable name that you set up, and this is an interval integer variable because you want to make it 01 binary zero meaning no checkmark one meaning checkmark.

179
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:33.420
Capstone Coach 1: And you can see, it says on value equal to one off value no check Sierra, and this is the, of course, the location God dot grid now I hope you know this little backslash backslash is is is there, so that I allows me to wrap the statement to another line.

180
00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:48.720
Capstone Coach 1: And if you have a comma, and then you don't need to have the backslap slash, but if you have like a period grid, which is what this really is, you see, normally, it would look like this.

181
00:26:49.740 --> 00:27:02.640
Capstone Coach 1: There right but look what happens in the state within overall you see that Gray line right here there's a Python standard that says don't go past the view can go back past degree line but.

182
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:08.970
Capstone Coach 1: Unlike the lockdown there's no consequences to complete to pass the Gray line.

183
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.150
Karen Fireman: But I Sir it's.

184
00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:16.980
Capstone Coach 1: Another for the Convention is don't do that, so what we do is we just break it right here.

185
00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:21.660
Capstone Coach 1: like that, and just move it over wherever you want.

186
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:32.190
Capstone Coach 1: And then put a backslash right there, which just says okay wrap up to the another no I like that okay.

187
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:44.610
Karen Fireman: Dr Jones i'm sorry but i'm still having trouble with this thing it's not it's not loading because it says that matt plot pipeline is not a package is there, something I need to install because.

188
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.640
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, what does it say what do you care.

189
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:57.330
Karen Fireman: it's a module not found error know module named matt plot live plot matt five is not a package so it's not even starting this.

190
00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:01.620
Capstone Coach 1: It do I have to call you'll have to show me tell me what line you're on now we're.

191
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:07.350
Karen Fireman: going to align it stops and it says when I when it's trying to import the library.

192
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.220
Karen Fireman: It won't do it because it doesn't seem in my environment.

193
00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:20.100
Capstone Coach 1: Good I just but I suspect what it's missing, as you have do you have an error message on this import 15.

194
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:22.920
Karen Fireman: Oh it's an error message.

195
00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:26.880
Karen Fireman: I don't know if it's that one but hold on one second i'm.

196
00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:30.900
Capstone Coach 1: Your look at your code and spider you should see a it either.

197
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:36.180
Karen Fireman: A 12 it says on 12 from no wait a minute.

198
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:54.510
Karen Fireman: You map hotline via import matt plotlines pipeline as plt won't let me do that the error is import the air is no module named matt plot lived up high plot is map out live is not a package so do I need to install this somehow inside the environment.

199
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.980
Capstone Coach 1: Well that's what it's telling you.

200
00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.960
Karen Fireman: I mean, why did we not need.

201
00:28:58.290 --> 00:28:59.520
Karen Fireman: People don't need to do that.

202
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:05.940
Capstone Coach 1: No i'm I have no idea because really if you've installed, the current version of anaconda it should be there.

203
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.360
Capstone Coach 1: Does anybody else have a.

204
00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.260
Karen Fireman: version and.

205
00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:12.630
Swanson J, Charles Richard: know.

206
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:15.870
Karen Fireman: What.

207
00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:23.070
Capstone Coach 1: You see, if you take a take a look at the current version of the version of anaconda that you're running.

208
00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:24.990
Karen Fireman: So here.

209
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:26.520
Capstone Coach 1: You are you listening.

210
00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:27.990
Karen Fireman: Can you hear us yes.

211
00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:30.840
Capstone Coach 1: Go back to anaconda right here.

212
00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:31.920
Karen Fireman: yeah I mean.

213
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:36.540
Capstone Coach 1: uh huh and then look at what version of anaconda you're running.

214
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:38.820
Karen Fireman: where's that.

215
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.960
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so let's see the.

216
00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:47.670
Karen Fireman: The way I do it version I don't know what the version is yeah.

217
00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.230
Karen Fireman: So I keep just load a library pip install.

218
00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:56.670
Capstone Coach 1: You go if you go up to about anaconda you look at see are you looking at my screen.

219
00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:57.480
Karen Fireman: I am.

220
00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:05.040
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, look at the upper left hand corner is just added condom that of cater go to about anaconda.

221
00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:12.000
Karen Fireman: Okay, it says restore move size minimum it doesn't say about it just.

222
00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:19.830
Capstone Coach 1: You click on Africa anaconda navigate around the menu comes down and that it shows about an account navigator.

223
00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:21.540
Capstone Coach 1: upper left.

224
00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.950
Karen Fireman: Okay, about OK, I see it says 1.9 point 12.

225
00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.040
Capstone Coach 1: Okay that's what I have as well.

226
00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:30.570
Capstone Coach 1: Is there so.

227
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.670
Karen Fireman: I could install that might help me.

228
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:40.290
Capstone Coach 1: Well let's take a look at that okay so let's go to anaconda navigator again.

229
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:44.580
Capstone Coach 1: let's go to preferences.

230
00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:50.850
Karen Fireman: preferences.

231
00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:55.080
Karen Fireman: Where are my preferences in the file yes preferences uh huh.

232
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:57.510
Karen Fireman: Yes, sir.

233
00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.750
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so, is it look like mine, I suppose.

234
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:08.280
Karen Fireman: yeah pretty much I mean, I know I mean my boxes are checked differently, but I mean, I have a thing that pops up like that.

235
00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:17.160
Capstone Coach 1: Okay i'm not sure that I see anything in here that would cause a problem for this okay cancel.

236
00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:21.570
Capstone Coach 1: Go to environments go to this page that i'm looking at right here.

237
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.950
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, how.

238
00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:31.470
Karen Fireman: The oranges dad from i'm not in the base i'm in the one we used from the last class that we had with the summer, for you is that not good.

239
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:33.300
Capstone Coach 1: you're.

240
00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:35.340
Karen Fireman: 56 when.

241
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.340
Capstone Coach 1: you're too close to your microphone or something.

242
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.090
Karen Fireman: I mean the Stat 565 when that we 60.

243
00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:49.470
Swanson J, Charles Richard: parent go ahead and use the page not not the environment we created for the other class.

244
00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:50.520
Karen Fireman: yeah okay.

245
00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:54.630
Capstone Coach 1: So you can see my i'm using the base vironment right here.

246
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:55.500
Okay.

247
00:31:58.380 --> 00:31:59.880
Capstone Coach 1: And if I look at the.

248
00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.110
Capstone Coach 1: modules that are installed in the base environment.

249
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.820
Capstone Coach 1: they're listed here Alphabetically you can go down to.

250
00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.940
Capstone Coach 1: him at.

251
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:24.090
Capstone Coach 1: right here, and it should show matt plot live version 322 that's what i'm saying and.

252
00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:29.250
Capstone Coach 1: there's a man i'm at the basis 322 there are actually two entries.

253
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:36.390
Karen Fireman: i've got 313 but at least it would have something and then the base it has 313 so maybe I need to update something, but at least it'll.

254
00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.670
Capstone Coach 1: Be oh no I mean it's there in the base right.

255
00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.070
Capstone Coach 1: yeah so shut down.

256
00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.320
Karen Fireman: lighter right okay.

257
00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:50.310
Capstone Coach 1: shut down spider a changed to the base environment and then reopen spider.

258
00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:52.170
Capstone Coach 1: Okay okay.

259
00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:54.960
Capstone Coach 1: Thank you, and then you should be good to go.

260
00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.740
Capstone Coach 1: Apparently, for some reason I but I don't know you know.

261
00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:02.490
Capstone Coach 1: That should have van and your other environment, you know the one.

262
00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:06.780
Karen Fireman: Who would have thought, so I should have been there, I don't know why questions there but.

263
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:10.320
Capstone Coach 1: You can of course install it in that environment.

264
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:14.580
Karen Fireman: Well, thank you, Charles for noticing and for Dr James Thank you.

265
00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:15.330
Capstone Coach 1: yeah sure.

266
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:17.400
Capstone Coach 1: So.

267
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:23.070
Capstone Coach 1: Here we are we're back back to this thing and.

268
00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.150
Capstone Coach 1: So there are the labels and.

269
00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:40.140
Capstone Coach 1: I was trying to explain what was happening here with these check buttons at the bottom and how they're set up and you could see that, for each check button, there is an integer variable.

270
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:55.350
Capstone Coach 1: And that variable is either zero or one you can set it off by going set zero so it's creates the integer variable and then sets it to off which, which is zero.

271
00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:09.810
Capstone Coach 1: And it does that, for each check button, it creates a variable with a different name each check button has its own variable and it's set to off to initially it no check and they are all.

272
00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:24.690
Capstone Coach 1: They all have variable equal to the variable parameter here is equal to the variable, that is, they actually got the heck okay stop that.

273
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:30.960
Capstone Coach 1: yeah the variable here is equal to the variable it was created.

274
00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:34.170
Capstone Coach 1: With that check but.

275
00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:44.880
Capstone Coach 1: Now, in addition to that you have command equals, and this is a this says that if they do check this call this function.

276
00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:58.950
Capstone Coach 1: And you see it says plot closed slot ball plot is see those were the little bitty things at the bottom here, and you can see that, when you call those it sets.

277
00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:00.330
Capstone Coach 1: Like if you call apply.

278
00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:05.730
Capstone Coach 1: Close it says it sets the variable associated with black close to one.

279
00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.790
Capstone Coach 1: It sets the others to zero.

280
00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:26.100
Capstone Coach 1: And you can see that same thing is done in these three cases, and then it says that the very last line call graph time series, and what that is is calling the function that actually produces the time series graph.

281
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:34.350
Capstone Coach 1: And so, if I go over here to graph time series right here.

282
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:41.190
Capstone Coach 1: You could see that it first of all gets the series.

283
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:48.510
Capstone Coach 1: This is another function get serious and what that function does is it.

284
00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:53.730
Capstone Coach 1: Is it checks to see whether the series is there.

285
00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:58.650
Capstone Coach 1: And back where is it say.

286
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:01.260
Okay.

287
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:10.050
Capstone Coach 1: yeah What it does is it pulls the data down from alpha vantage.

288
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:19.860
Capstone Coach 1: Get series is the function that we use and the previous gui and every gooey sense, then, to call.

289
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:31.980
Capstone Coach 1: alpha vantage weeks we you know you set up the URL for the call and then here's the result that comes in, and then we do a check to make sure that it actually came back.

290
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:42.390
Capstone Coach 1: And if it didn't come back then you issue a warning that says whoo we didn't find that symbol, and if you clear everything and return to a neutral state.

291
00:36:44.280 --> 00:37:04.920
Capstone Coach 1: If it does, find it then we go about pulling out of the file, the volume the adjusted close the closing price and just for the heck of it, I pulled out, also the low and the high price, so we could have actually done a graph for the low price and the high price for each day.

292
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:12.900
Capstone Coach 1: And, but we just stuck to these first three right here so small whole bunch of information that comes back.

293
00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:22.110
Capstone Coach 1: And then we create three data frames, one for the date by itself, because this is the index column.

294
00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:30.480
Capstone Coach 1: date time and then one for the floating point values and one for the initial values, and then we concatenate them all together.

295
00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:37.830
Capstone Coach 1: And we've set the index to that date column that's Davis actually in dfc row here.

296
00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:42.180
Capstone Coach 1: I could see how that's all being done.

297
00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:44.550
Capstone Coach 1: and

298
00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:58.140
Capstone Coach 1: Then we get to graph time series so grab time series starts by getting the data right there getting the data and checks to see if the symbol is missing, if it is said that a warning to get out of here.

299
00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:13.260
Capstone Coach 1: Actually, this was the warning would have been issued in gate series i'm not sure this isn't necessary right here, because get series as a warning that that that you know declares all the series is not there.

300
00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:16.440
Capstone Coach 1: So I think this could be removed.

301
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:21.270
Capstone Coach 1: What i'm going to do here.

302
00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:24.420
Capstone Coach 1: Is comment it out.

303
00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:26.550
Capstone Coach 1: like this.

304
00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:34.050
Capstone Coach 1: and

305
00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:39.360
Capstone Coach 1: The ui is running so i'm going to shut it down.

306
00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:44.370
Capstone Coach 1: And then we're going to i'm going to start up.

307
00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:48.870
Capstone Coach 1: Here it is.

308
00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:57.060
Capstone Coach 1: let's run a test, first with IBM make sure that that that's room working volume.

309
00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:06.390
Capstone Coach 1: There it works OK, now we change that to X X, which I know doesn't work and i'm going to click volume again.

310
00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:09.480
Capstone Coach 1: Up symbol not found.

311
00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:20.550
Capstone Coach 1: Oh, this isn't a bogus this, this is another warning message.

312
00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:33.690
Capstone Coach 1: i'm not sure where that's coming from, but you can see that it did run otherwise so simple not found and i'm getting a double warning message i'll have to.

313
00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:38.760
Capstone Coach 1: check why that's happening, but at any rate.

314
00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:43.680
Capstone Coach 1: yeah that's probably happening back here.

315
00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:58.470
Capstone Coach 1: Oh, I know what's going on, it comes back here to say go back to graph so yeah so in this area when it doesn't find the symbol.

316
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:06.630
Capstone Coach 1: It coughs up right here returns, but where does it return to it returns to.

317
00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:09.150
Capstone Coach 1: hear.

318
00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:16.140
Capstone Coach 1: And continues running as if everything is okay it doesn't know that it got a bad.

319
00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:30.990
Capstone Coach 1: symbol, so I need to keep that's why I need to keep this in here, I need to keep this in here so that, if it comes back from get serious with a warning I know about it and I get out of here so.

320
00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.970
Capstone Coach 1: That is actually necessary, so I.

321
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.510
Capstone Coach 1: Now let's let's run the same test here.

322
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:43.110
Capstone Coach 1: let's see and there it is.

323
00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:46.320
Capstone Coach 1: And so i'm going to put an x X.

324
00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:50.640
Capstone Coach 1: and quick Volume I get a.

325
00:40:51.990 --> 00:41:05.670
Capstone Coach 1: symbol missing thing okay that's a little that's why it's their symbol not found is issued by graphs here get serious and then symbol missing.

326
00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:10.080
Capstone Coach 1: Is issued by this one right here.

327
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:16.470
Capstone Coach 1: Now what we could do is, we could we could close, we could close that out.

328
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.800
Capstone Coach 1: So we don't get a double warning.

329
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.800
Capstone Coach 1: and

330
00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:27.240
Capstone Coach 1: I kind of like that that better.

331
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:31.830
Capstone Coach 1: Let me restart.

332
00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:41.640
Capstone Coach 1: OK, and now, if I hit XX I should just get one morning message at see.

333
00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:53.730
Capstone Coach 1: Similar civil XX not found that's it okay good so line number two to seven I would take it out or or just make it a comment statement.

334
00:41:54.750 --> 00:42:08.370
Capstone Coach 1: Which is what I did so that we still have the same line numbers and then you don't get that double warning message okay let's let me quit playing around here and get down to business right so.

335
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:28.560
Capstone Coach 1: let's open up the going first thing we want to do is draw the little separator line right here and we already talked about how we did that, and then we, of course, did the did the little code for these guys right here now let's work on this upper part Okay, if you look at the assignment.

336
00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:31.920
Capstone Coach 1: here.

337
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:34.500
Capstone Coach 1: No.

338
00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:41.730
Capstone Coach 1: There it is this box you notice this box right here.

339
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:44.580
Capstone Coach 1: This is actually a frame.

340
00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:54.210
Capstone Coach 1: So the first thing we need to do is is put this frame into our gooey will show you how you do that so.

341
00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:19.050
Capstone Coach 1: All right, stay with me here just a minute tried to.

342
00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:32.640
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

343
00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:42.960
Capstone Coach 1: Go back here all right, if you go down to.

344
00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:53.220
Capstone Coach 1: Let me go to the top again, so this is where we're creating the gooey right, so the last thing we do at the bottom here.

345
00:44:54.780 --> 00:45:07.530
Capstone Coach 1: is put in the check buttons you see all that checkbox business right so after after that that's the bottom of this is where we stop we're right now in this little.

346
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:14.220
Capstone Coach 1: version of our APP This is where we stop putting stuff on the mainframe.

347
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:21.690
Capstone Coach 1: Now we're going to create a new frame in that little upper right hand corner and it looks like this.

348
00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:36.930
Capstone Coach 1: whoops so here it is so what you do is you say, given a name i'm calling this the stock frame another good name, for it would be favorite frame.

349
00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:42.390
Capstone Coach 1: Of like Bob frame i'm gonna make it five frame I like that okay.

350
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.610
Capstone Coach 1: whoops little.

351
00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:46.440
Older.

352
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:53.250
Capstone Coach 1: Of frame like that.

353
00:45:56.370 --> 00:46:01.860
Capstone Coach 1: And notice what I have here five frame is is is a is a tck frame.

354
00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:17.760
Capstone Coach 1: Just like mainframe it's the frame another frame, but instead of putting it on the canvas canvas you know, the thing it says good when i'm putting it on the primary frame mainframe.

355
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:30.270
Capstone Coach 1: And then I can put some padding around the frame of the bed the padding is you know what it is okay i'm gonna make it 555 Okay, I have to tell you about the.

356
00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:43.320
Capstone Coach 1: 555 so that says, I got a frame here and I want to have five pixels all the way around the border okay now that's the that's the patty inside the frame, by the way.

357
00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:56.670
Capstone Coach 1: So anything that goes inside that frame then inside of the frame, it will not be able to get within five pixels so the end of the border left right top bottom.

358
00:46:58.110 --> 00:46:58.590
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

359
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:10.350
Capstone Coach 1: Now, you see, where it says relief sunken you don't need to have that in there, but i'll show you what happens if you don't OK now i'm going to just.

360
00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:16.380
Capstone Coach 1: change this to I don't know flat, I think, is the word.

361
00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:32.190
Capstone Coach 1: like that, and then you see you, it says border with equal to five that's describing that you're going to put a border around the stream and that's just that's how why that borders, going to be.

362
00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:39.990
Capstone Coach 1: Now let me run this and show you what happens with it as it is and.

363
00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:42.600
Capstone Coach 1: I think I did, I think that ran.

364
00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:48.360
Capstone Coach 1: Oh wait a minute I need to restart.

365
00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:50.520
Capstone Coach 1: run.

366
00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:55.590
Capstone Coach 1: All right.

367
00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:57.570
Capstone Coach 1: Nothing.

368
00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:01.800
Capstone Coach 1: that's because it's flat.

369
00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:12.690
Capstone Coach 1: With you use the relief equal to flat you don't see anything but the frame is there, believe me, so we can actually put stuff in that frame.

370
00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:28.620
Capstone Coach 1: Just as if it was a new going a new mainframe and we could put buttons and labels and there were sort of thing in there and we would you would refer to it as as the fat frame now let's close this and make relief sunken.

371
00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:43.590
Capstone Coach 1: like that and i'm going to rewind going to rerun it and whoa cool so now, you see the border because that's sunken so it looks like it's a little swimming pool or something.

372
00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:56.610
Capstone Coach 1: And this black line you see here, believe it or not, that's five pixels Okay, let me show you some what might happen here let's change the border with from five to let's say 50.

373
00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:58.560
Capstone Coach 1: And rerun it.

374
00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:01.110
Capstone Coach 1: see what happens.

375
00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:14.940
Capstone Coach 1: whoo yeah I agree that what I wanted, but if you like, that effect, you can certainly do that right, so that five that we have there that is controlling how.

376
00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:34.410
Capstone Coach 1: Gray, or how big this border is known as the border goes, all the way around there's a light part and then there's a great part dark Gray part right there, so if you play with that if five looks kind of Okay, I mean we could put it as three let's see what three looks like.

377
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:42.870
Capstone Coach 1: So there's always a little okay that's pretty cool that's okay yeah that's all right three or five that's good.

378
00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:48.060
Capstone Coach 1: What you see in the homework solution is five so i'm going to go back to buy.

379
00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:53.670
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so we will do exactly what we have the assignment.

380
00:49:55.290 --> 00:50:02.520
Capstone Coach 1: Now the next line you see it says five afraid grid now the grid is a procedure you.

381
00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:05.100
Capstone Coach 1: Call it's like a style.

382
00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:09.120
Capstone Coach 1: procedure, it says Okay, this is where I want you to put this frame.

383
00:50:10.740 --> 00:50:15.030
Capstone Coach 1: So I want another frame is going on top of mainframe.

384
00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:30.150
Capstone Coach 1: But you have to refer to the column in the row and mainframe that you want to put it on so notice it says column three row one, so if I were run the see right here okay.

385
00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:37.890
Capstone Coach 1: column 3123 row one is right here.

386
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:45.360
Capstone Coach 1: So the upper left hand corner is going here column three row one right there.

387
00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:48.330
Capstone Coach 1: And then notice what happens it.

388
00:50:48.330 --> 00:51:00.930
Capstone Coach 1: says row span six oh you i'm going to start at one, but you want me to go six rows 1234 you know, five and six, so it comes on the way down to here.

389
00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:15.240
Capstone Coach 1: Now, if I said seven they were it have a conflict because the separator is right here, it would it would cross over that little separator line so you have a hard time, seeing it but there's actually a little line right there.

390
00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:17.340
Capstone Coach 1: And then.

391
00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:30.900
Capstone Coach 1: It says sticky north west east, south, it says drive from this upper left hand corner Northwest to the lower right se.

392
00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:39.990
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so that's what the sticky there is is all about God, you know I noticed that it also says column span is equal to.

393
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.530
two.

394
00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:45.360
Capstone Coach 1: And so it's going from column for two column five.

395
00:51:46.530 --> 00:52:04.950
Capstone Coach 1: column for one to three to four excuse me starts in column three and goes to call them for so the columns span and for a frame the column span of the row span are really important because it sort of tells the code how big are you going to make that frame.

396
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:07.410
Capstone Coach 1: So this.

397
00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:08.070
question.

398
00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:10.260
Capstone Coach 1: Is a question.

399
00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.070
Yes.

400
00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:13.410
Capstone Coach 1: Okay yeah.

401
00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:24.990
Gupta, Satyam: Yes, yes, yes, so what's the difference between placing these this second frame on a previous frame versus previous canvas or like the main canvas right.

402
00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:30.330
Capstone Coach 1: Okay i'm not sure i'm understanding what you said, can you can you do that again a little bit louder.

403
00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:30.960
Gupta, Satyam: Yes, please.

404
00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:41.130
Gupta, Satyam: I was asking what is the difference between putting this second frame on the mainframe or on the main canvas What is the difference.

405
00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:52.260
Capstone Coach 1: You could put it on the main canvas you could do that but, and that works if you're going to have two frames that are side by side.

406
00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:56.940
Capstone Coach 1: or two frames that are one on top of the other that you could do it that way okay.

407
00:52:57.330 --> 00:53:07.290
Capstone Coach 1: But I use this approach put it on, and on top of the frame because the the firm when I initially drew the the mainframe it was over the entire canvas.

408
00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:23.820
Capstone Coach 1: So if you if you wanted to use your approach Well, first of all you're going to have a little trouble with the with the closing price on the volume here right because this this frame is not covered the entire area, the canvas on the right hand side.

409
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:33.990
Gupta, Satyam: yeah I guess this clarifies it Okay, I understood now because the mainframe or sorry the main canvas was 650 600 or 500 pixels so okay I.

410
00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:49.440
Capstone Coach 1: know that answers it and you can do what you want to do, but you and, in some cases that's the right thing to do, by the way right, so we could have you know, we could have had one frame up here at the top and then another frame at the bottom.

411
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:53.550
Capstone Coach 1: That might actually be a better solution.

412
00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:56.580
Capstone Coach 1: So you put mainframe up here at the.

413
00:53:56.580 --> 00:54:03.870
Capstone Coach 1: Top right, and then you put the plot frame below it that might be a better solution.

414
00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:09.000
Capstone Coach 1: you'd still end up with a mainframe up here, where you wanted to put a.

415
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:21.420
Capstone Coach 1: companion frame right to the side of it, and you know, so you could have three frames one year one year and one down here all on the canvas.

416
00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:25.110
Capstone Coach 1: But so it's just another way of doing it right.

417
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.640
Gupta, Satyam: This clarifies it Thank you.

418
00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:27.900
Capstone Coach 1: yeah yeah.

419
00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:28.920
Capstone Coach 1: Good question.

420
00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.730
Okay.

421
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:38.490
Capstone Coach 1: So that's how we created a frame and now we can put anything in there that we want well, the first thing we want to put in, is one of these little buttons.

422
00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:44.040
Capstone Coach 1: check back so what i'm going to do is i'm going to copy, one of the check button this right here.

423
00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:59.760
Capstone Coach 1: yep and the beaches that's the check button for adjusted close i'm just going to copy that and i'm going to put it directly blown here like that except well it's not going to be the check button it's going to be IBM.

424
00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:10.050
Capstone Coach 1: that's our one of our test favorites right and instead of saying self a sequel to iron T whatever.

425
00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:17.490
Capstone Coach 1: i'm just going to call this view well let's see hang on, let me go back and use that.

426
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:21.870
Capstone Coach 1: yeah yeah OK OK OK.

427
00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:25.020
Capstone Coach 1: i'm going to call it s one.

428
00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.800
Capstone Coach 1: And i'm going to say yes one set.

429
00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.700
Capstone Coach 1: And i'm going to say.

430
00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:47.970
Capstone Coach 1: Now here, you have to give it a different name but you can't this is, this is a check button, so one is a variable So this is the check button, then for the check button i'm going to call it sc one.

431
00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:49.440
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

432
00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:53.970
Capstone Coach 1: See see what.

433
00:55:55.560 --> 00:56:08.520
Capstone Coach 1: color whatever i'm using the one here, because this is the first item on my list it's going to be the IBM thing now the variable name has to be changed to s one Okay, of course.

434
00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:14.760
Capstone Coach 1: And now the command, I want to, I want to go sell something.

435
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:23.880
Capstone Coach 1: Whether they use my solution for that I use something called stock one yeah.

436
00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:27.240
Capstone Coach 1: stock one.

437
00:56:29.550 --> 00:56:39.540
Capstone Coach 1: So there, there are about six or seven of these that we're going to do the first one is IBM, and what we're just going to number them so that that way if I wanted to change the.

438
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:49.590
Capstone Coach 1: The the you know, the symbol that i'm using or whatever from IBM to something else I can do that by just changing this IBM right there.

439
00:56:50.910 --> 00:57:06.030
Capstone Coach 1: Now where's it going right now it's going in column to row eight now nope nope let's make that column one row one because i'm not using Ray mainframe i'm going to use of.

440
00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:22.200
Capstone Coach 1: frame like that so we're using the different frame when we're not on a frame, so this row one column one refers to the you know this this frame full frame.

441
00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:23.700
That.

442
00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:27.150
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

443
00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:33.570
Capstone Coach 1: yeah okay all right so.

444
00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:42.930
Capstone Coach 1: let's close make sure we closed down what we've done and we're going to run it now and see what happens.

445
00:57:44.130 --> 00:57:44.700
Capstone Coach 1: oops.

446
00:57:46.650 --> 00:57:48.960
Capstone Coach 1: Oh, oh yeah.

447
00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:51.990
Capstone Coach 1: I got an error is.

448
00:57:53.160 --> 00:58:09.330
Capstone Coach 1: stuck gui object, as new attributes stock one, in other words, this function does not exist, so we actually have to create that function and what we can do is, we can just put it right down here call a D.

449
00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:11.490
Capstone Coach 1: stock one.

450
00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:15.420
Capstone Coach 1: Self.

451
00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:23.070
Capstone Coach 1: Golan fall like that, and then put us come in here this.

452
00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:27.390
Capstone Coach 1: creates.

453
00:58:29.310 --> 00:58:36.630
Capstone Coach 1: The information for the first stock okay.

454
00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:42.000
Capstone Coach 1: And that that stock in particular is IBM so.

455
00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:50.160
Capstone Coach 1: hang on here.

456
00:59:23.250 --> 00:59:24.300
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, there we go.

457
00:59:26.850 --> 00:59:37.980
Capstone Coach 1: i'm going to take this out for just right now, but you can see what it does, it says, basically, it says set this stock to checked.

458
00:59:42.090 --> 00:59:54.330
Capstone Coach 1: Set the symbol entry remember self symbol is the entry for the symbol set the symbol, the stocks self stocks zero now.

459
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:55.890
Capstone Coach 1: Oh.

460
00:59:58.470 --> 01:00:01.740
Capstone Coach 1: yeah there's a little bit of a funky thing I did here.

461
01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:05.700
Capstone Coach 1: Before I created this check button.

462
01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:13.560
Capstone Coach 1: I created a list, right here, of all the stocks self that stock.

463
01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:18.750
Capstone Coach 1: equals and then I just put a list here, IBM.

464
01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:23.490
Capstone Coach 1: A PL for apple.

465
01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:28.320
Capstone Coach 1: and so forth, I actually have about eight of them, I think, on the gui.

466
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:51.870
Capstone Coach 1: That are there and so here, it says set the symbol to the first entry that's zero and then call a function called stock Stat now this function basically creates all of the the information for the stock puts it in that the top five rows right.

467
01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:56.700
Capstone Coach 1: So let me show you what that looks like sucks that.

468
01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.220
Capstone Coach 1: sucks that brother.

469
01:01:00.810 --> 01:01:01.320
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

470
01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:05.520
Capstone Coach 1: So basically.

471
01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:09.120
Capstone Coach 1: This function.

472
01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:12.180
Capstone Coach 1: populates the entire.

473
01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:14.340
Capstone Coach 1: group gooey.

474
01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:24.270
Capstone Coach 1: i'm going to go back here i'm going to i'm going to turn off that call for just right now called don't call it okay.

475
01:01:25.350 --> 01:01:28.230
Capstone Coach 1: So let's just run what we have and see what happens.

476
01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.240
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so.

477
01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:50.010
Capstone Coach 1: that's what you get you see, I don't know if you could see that, but it says, IBM and it's it's not you didn't do it right, because I started it with a.

478
01:01:50.940 --> 01:02:06.060
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, while the other one was running, you can see that there's the right thing, so now, you can see, IBM is in the frame and where is it it's in the upper left hand corner, because I said column one row on that's going to be the upper left hand corner here.

479
01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:19.320
Capstone Coach 1: And then, if I wanted another one of these i'd have to have like I apple in there let's let me show you what for that what we do is, we would just take.

480
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:22.890
Capstone Coach 1: This part right here, where it says sc.

481
01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:27.150
Capstone Coach 1: One or s one rather IBM.

482
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:31.110
Capstone Coach 1: and

483
01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:40.500
Capstone Coach 1: i'm going to make call this this too.

484
01:02:44.250 --> 01:02:55.830
Capstone Coach 1: See two I think instead of IBM right here, I think what I would do is, I would just use this stock list, right here so i'm going to say sell stocks oops.

485
01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:02.520
Capstone Coach 1: zero.

486
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:06.390
Capstone Coach 1: That would be IBM and then here.

487
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:14.010
Capstone Coach 1: It would just be self stocks one like that.

488
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:27.390
Capstone Coach 1: So you could you could get the get the idea you just create this list, and I think the third one is Microsoft m s.

489
01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:30.600
Capstone Coach 1: Microsoft.

490
01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:31.800
FT.

491
01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:36.480
Karen Fireman: SDP F like frank, do you like Thomas.

492
01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:37.560
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, great.

493
01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:40.230
Karen Fireman: You got DDT tell ya.

494
01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:48.450
Capstone Coach 1: If you're not sure sure what the symbols would should be just Google it stock symbol for whatever.

495
01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:50.880
Capstone Coach 1: you'll get.

496
01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:52.620
Karen Fireman: that you have a D there.

497
01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:58.440
Karen Fireman: it's not right yeah MSF D, you need MSF tea Thomas.

498
01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:04.500
Karen Fireman: No, no tea Thomas not see Charles.

499
01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:06.150
Wright, Elizabeth Harrison: Okay tango.

500
01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:06.570
Karen Fireman: yep.

501
01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:07.110
You got it.

502
01:04:08.670 --> 01:04:09.000
Capstone Coach 1: Good.

503
01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:11.910
Capstone Coach 1: All right.

504
01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:14.520
Capstone Coach 1: So.

505
01:04:16.410 --> 01:04:28.950
Capstone Coach 1: Now it's the command here is going to stock one I would actually have to make this a stock two or something like that, but i'm just going to leave at stock one right now, and so you get the idea.

506
01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.330
Capstone Coach 1: So if we run this as it is.

507
01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.240
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

508
01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:45.330
Capstone Coach 1: Oh, I get an error, they should have been stocks plural.

509
01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:49.890
Capstone Coach 1: corresponding to the list name stocks.

510
01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.530
Capstone Coach 1: run it again.

511
01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:56.160
Capstone Coach 1: and

512
01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:06.060
Capstone Coach 1: Actually run into it probably running has the other one in the background, there oh.

513
01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:18.840
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so what happened, IBM well what happened was I didn't change the room number, so I have column one row on it should be column one row to.

514
01:05:20.190 --> 01:05:20.880
Capstone Coach 1: like that.

515
01:05:22.860 --> 01:05:24.660
Capstone Coach 1: And you run it again.

516
01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:28.920
Capstone Coach 1: There you go.

517
01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:44.250
Capstone Coach 1: Now, if I click on either one of these like a ppl, though, is still coming and they're always coming up IBM right and notice that both of them are checked, so what happened there is.

518
01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:48.390
Capstone Coach 1: This.

519
01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:54.630
Karen Fireman: Both in stock one is that make a difference on line 130.

520
01:05:55.230 --> 01:06:01.470
Capstone Coach 1: yeah well that's why because I didn't want to you see this function, right here stock one, there would be a stock to.

521
01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:12.300
Capstone Coach 1: throw you in slack to you would say sets, as you know, instead of saying set as one you would set as to.

522
01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:14.010
Capstone Coach 1: The.

523
01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:31.110
Capstone Coach 1: And instead of getting stocks zero you'd get stocks one if you following me on that, so there, there needs to be for each of these PENA that there's probably a more efficient way to do this, and in fact i'm sure there is but.

524
01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:43.920
Capstone Coach 1: When you're lazy it's just easy to cut and paste like this, and this would be to, and this would be one like that okay.

525
01:06:46.830 --> 01:06:48.750
Capstone Coach 1: So you with me, yes.

526
01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:49.680
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

527
01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:58.320
Capstone Coach 1: So, and now now, it will it should behave a little better if, after I made those changes and you'll see that.

528
01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:04.020
Capstone Coach 1: It was still going to come up IBM because it's because i'll show you why.

529
01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.720
Capstone Coach 1: Close close that.

530
01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:13.950
Capstone Coach 1: Because both have written we're using this one, and if I needed to change this to see us to right here.

531
01:07:16.410 --> 01:07:19.230
Capstone Coach 1: In order to keep that from happening.

532
01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:28.230
Capstone Coach 1: But so now we're your word calling Oh, and here it says stock one I need to make that spock to like that.

533
01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:34.320
Capstone Coach 1: That so it's calling this ones that have that one, you know that sort of business.

534
01:07:35.790 --> 01:07:50.040
Capstone Coach 1: Now i'm going to i'm going to kayden leave the rest of it to you i'll give you some let me talk about this, and just sort of give you some hints on this, so at this point.

535
01:07:51.480 --> 01:08:00.810
Capstone Coach 1: What we have is we have after you finish this for all of the stocks you're going to have a list of them right here you're going to have all the checkboxes right in here.

536
01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:13.470
Capstone Coach 1: But now comes the coding part and there a couple of tricks one is i'd like to have the centered over here, somewhere, the show you how you do that.

537
01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.110
Capstone Coach 1: When we created the frame.

538
01:08:19.170 --> 01:08:28.470
Capstone Coach 1: The the padding is 5555 hey let's put 50 let's put 50 spaces on the left hand side like that.

539
01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:34.350
Capstone Coach 1: 55 five, well then, oh.

540
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:45.630
Capstone Coach 1: Maybe I should use 55 I don't know so it's kind of a funky way but do this but it works on this particular case, you can see what's happening.

541
01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:49.470
Capstone Coach 1: it's probably a better way to do it.

542
01:08:50.670 --> 01:08:58.410
Capstone Coach 1: I just put a little 50 in there and i'm lose everything over now now let's talk about the hard part Okay, the hard part is.

543
01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:14.490
Capstone Coach 1: it's not the hard part it's the coding part really when you click on one of these what's supposed to happen is all of the the the symbol should appear right here in that first box.

544
01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:24.510
Capstone Coach 1: And then, all of the the information for the symbol closing price previous all this information should appear in the the boxes below it.

545
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:26.640
Capstone Coach 1: And then.

546
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.740
Capstone Coach 1: If any of.

547
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.050
Capstone Coach 1: These I think of what I did was I just automatically.

548
01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:40.320
Capstone Coach 1: chose closing price as the default graph and I put that right here.

549
01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:47.070
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so when you click on this right now well all it does is put the symbol there right.

550
01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:51.870
Capstone Coach 1: But now you need to fill in everything else.

551
01:09:52.980 --> 01:10:00.270
Capstone Coach 1: How does that happen well, you have the code already there and different place different areas if I click on this button.

552
01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:03.300
Capstone Coach 1: see that happens.

553
01:10:04.710 --> 01:10:21.840
Capstone Coach 1: So look at the function for the button and call it when you when right in here, you know where it says stock one I just decided to to create a generic function called stock price or stock status see that.

554
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:31.530
Capstone Coach 1: A generic function called starts that now that'll that's going to come in that's going to be a new function it'll be under here and i'll put in here and the.

555
01:10:32.610 --> 01:10:35.190
Capstone Coach 1: This is the function it's it's a lot of small one.

556
01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.960
Capstone Coach 1: That self.

557
01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:44.670
Capstone Coach 1: Like that Okay, so this function.

558
01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:46.800
Capstone Coach 1: Basically.

559
01:10:47.970 --> 01:10:48.630
Capstone Coach 1: produce.

560
01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:51.330
Capstone Coach 1: The entries.

561
01:10:52.830 --> 01:10:55.620
Capstone Coach 1: For the price button.

562
01:10:57.570 --> 01:10:58.230
Capstone Coach 1: and

563
01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:14.970
Capstone Coach 1: A graph door to scrap DS grab for clothes like that so that's what basically what you want to do here and you might.

564
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:17.250
Capstone Coach 1: wonder.

565
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:26.520
Capstone Coach 1: How come i'm getting an error there oh it's going to give me an error until I do something, right here, but something there um.

566
01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:29.940
Karen Fireman: DAS.

567
01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.430
Capstone Coach 1: Yes, Karen go ahead.

568
01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:33.750
Karen Fireman: You can put pass.

569
01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:35.700
Capstone Coach 1: What.

570
01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:40.200
Karen Fireman: will pass will prevent the error on and it won't do anything but it will prevent the error.

571
01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:51.450
Capstone Coach 1: there's an error, I mean what is it what is it you want me to do.

572
01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:56.520
Capstone Coach 1: i'm sorry I don't understand.

573
01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:58.170
Karen Fireman: it's okay go ahead i'm sorry.

574
01:11:58.770 --> 01:11:59.430
Okay.

575
01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:06.810
Capstone Coach 1: yeah that error that little red think it comes to their until you put something in the in here like print Hello.

576
01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:09.510
Capstone Coach 1: say.

577
01:12:11.010 --> 01:12:16.770
Capstone Coach 1: There goes away it's just telling me that hey you didn't put anything in that function there's no there's nothing there.

578
01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:27.120
Capstone Coach 1: So I take this that's that's why you're getting the red X so soon as you start coding here, let me find so what am I going to put here well first thing i'm going to put here is.

579
01:12:28.530 --> 01:12:32.250
Capstone Coach 1: Basically, I want to populate the.

580
01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:44.460
Capstone Coach 1: All this information, so, if you look at the button for price it cause a function and that function produces this information right.

581
01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:52.350
Capstone Coach 1: So that would be one of the first things that you want to put here is a basically a call to that other function.

582
01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:56.190
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, and.

583
01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:04.800
Capstone Coach 1: And then you will have a call to produce the time series and that call.

584
01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:13.050
Capstone Coach 1: You know you put the time see that's the same thing as checking on this box right here, you check on that box boom.

585
01:13:14.730 --> 01:13:20.010
Capstone Coach 1: So you you basically what you're doing is when I check check this box IBM.

586
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:26.760
Capstone Coach 1: first thing I want to do is it's clear any other clearly any of the others in the list that might be already checked.

587
01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:33.540
Capstone Coach 1: And then, what i'm going to do is i'm going to call this same function that this button calls right here.

588
01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:43.920
Capstone Coach 1: And then, what i'm going to do is call the same function i'm going to check this box, make sure all of these other boxes are cleared.

589
01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:50.520
Capstone Coach 1: check this box and then call the same function that produces that graph right here.

590
01:13:52.410 --> 01:13:53.040
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

591
01:13:56.130 --> 01:13:58.950
Capstone Coach 1: that's what she so that's where you are right now with that.

592
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.540
Capstone Coach 1: and

593
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.770
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so I think that's about, but as far as I wanted to go.

594
01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:23.280
Capstone Coach 1: yeah so my version of that Stat thing it's not so bad it's about I don't know 100 lines something like that.

595
01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:31.290
Capstone Coach 1: So, because you already have the code there and other places and you're just calling that other code.

596
01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:42.150
Capstone Coach 1: When you know you're calling the same code that price button calls and then the same code that is called when you click on one of these buttons click on that button.

597
01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:49.500
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, now, of course, if I click on volume like that notice what happens it.

598
01:14:50.910 --> 01:14:56.160
Capstone Coach 1: clears it out, or if I click on the chose to price, it does clears it out for it with IBM.

599
01:14:57.270 --> 01:15:09.090
Capstone Coach 1: Now, right now, if I click on apple notice it doesn't clear the IBM button you want it, you want it does put the aapl up here in the symbol area.

600
01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:15.810
Capstone Coach 1: It didn't clear the apple of the IBM, so you need to you know when that function.

601
01:15:16.890 --> 01:15:24.060
Capstone Coach 1: What is it what are we calling it stocks that will not function is called the first thing needs to do is to clear all the other items in this list.

602
01:15:25.230 --> 01:15:40.110
Capstone Coach 1: And then hit them then basically hit the price button and then hit the closing price for that particular and notices picking up apple Inc and then, if I hit the price it'll change over to private apple like that so.

603
01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:47.700
Capstone Coach 1: All of those features are working, you just need to when you click over here, you need to make make use of that.

604
01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:51.750
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, any questions before we say goodnight.

605
01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:58.380
Karen Fireman: Yes, Sir, if you get a chance, I really need help getting the map plot line to work it doesn't work at all I.

606
01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:06.780
Capstone Coach 1: tried OK now i'm having a little trouble hearing yeah they can maybe get your MIC a little closer, something that may be me Okay, I just have problems with certain.

607
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:14.820
Swanson J, Charles Richard: You know i'm this is Charles karen's having trouble getting her matt plot lab to execute.

608
01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:20.310
Capstone Coach 1: The live matt plot live videos you're having trouble getting it to execute.

609
01:16:20.670 --> 01:16:25.950
Karen Fireman: Yes, yes, well, I tried everything everybody said I read restarted everything I went to the.

610
01:16:25.950 --> 01:16:37.290
Capstone Coach 1: Basic okay what you what you what you should do at this point what advice would do would be to go back to the lecture notes for week two and in particular.

611
01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:52.560
Capstone Coach 1: Let me open this up for you okay go to file open and you want to look at it says math plot template open that up math block template and here we go and.

612
01:16:53.490 --> 01:17:06.930
Capstone Coach 1: This is the template for math lot obviously right and what you should do is notice that the math lot live is important, is in there, and all that roughness and.

613
01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:13.710
Capstone Coach 1: What you should Well, first of all let me reset everything okay restart the Colonel.

614
01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:16.830
Capstone Coach 1: we're working on a different Program.

615
01:17:22.230 --> 01:17:24.480
Capstone Coach 1: OK, and now run it.

616
01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:26.970
Karen Fireman: I get the same error, sir.

617
01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.610
Capstone Coach 1: I did, that if you if you run it.

618
01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:32.940
Karen Fireman: What does not run it all same error.

619
01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:36.030
Capstone Coach 1: What is the error.

620
01:17:37.050 --> 01:17:44.010
Karen Fireman: It says module not found error know module named matt plotline maybe I can share my screen at some point when when the.

621
01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:47.370
Capstone Coach 1: wall what is she is complaining about the environment is.

622
01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:53.400
Karen Fireman: Yes, it is, but i've tried to redo it several times, I just don't think i'll be able to do the homework, if I can't get your help, maybe later.

623
01:17:53.850 --> 01:17:58.200
Capstone Coach 1: Did you are you, you did you restart spider.

624
01:17:58.350 --> 01:17:59.760
Karen Fireman: Everything five times.

625
01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:04.260
Capstone Coach 1: So and you're on the base you're on the base environment.

626
01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.970
Karen Fireman: yep switch that.

627
01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:10.110
Capstone Coach 1: Did you go and to the environment and look for matt plot.

628
01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:28.680
Karen Fireman: did not do that again, but I did it okay environment on in the base, we had found it, I thought I was, I found it while I was talking to you I believe i'm maybe I can at some point share my screen and you can see what what crazy thing is going on um.

629
01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:32.250
Capstone Coach 1: No.

630
01:18:33.330 --> 01:18:34.050

633
01:18:47.070 --> 01:19:00.690

Capstone Coach 1: Hopefully.

646
01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:24.660
Joanna Fritz: Regions and I have a question about the homework.

647
01:20:25.650 --> 01:20:26.280
Capstone Coach 1: yeah sure.

648
01:20:26.730 --> 01:20:33.300
Joanna Fritz: So just for clarification and it says that you want us to.

649
01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:51.570
Joanna Fritz: See you want us to be able to click on the stock sob which is not listed in the screenshot that you have so did you want us to add it or replace one of the options and that menu or doesn't matter.

650
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:57.330
Capstone Coach 1: i'm not sure I didn't understand the question john can you do that again okay.

651
01:20:57.390 --> 01:21:05.790
Joanna Fritz: um yeah so at the bottom of the assignment, it says show what happens when you click on the stock s LV.

652
01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:11.520
Joanna Fritz: m, and this is not listed among the favorites so.

653
01:21:12.630 --> 01:21:14.550
Joanna Fritz: So I don't think that it's listed.

654
01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:16.440
Capstone Coach 1: Unless if I misunderstand no.

655
01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:21.690
Capstone Coach 1: No, no, there yeah it's clear type it in and click and show what happens.

656
01:21:22.170 --> 01:21:23.940
Joanna Fritz: Okay, so you don't want us to.

657
01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:26.190
Capstone Coach 1: reply I don't want it in the favorite list.

658
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:27.270
Joanna Fritz: Okay okay.

659
01:21:27.690 --> 01:21:35.100
Capstone Coach 1: that's that I wanted I wanted you to show okay does this also works if you put in a regular stock.

660
01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:37.260
Joanna Fritz: I see okay got it.

661
01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:45.900
Capstone Coach 1: Another stock the favorite Daddy of the favorite list is that if you're an investor, there are four or five or six or so stocks that maybe purchase and you want to follow.

662
01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:54.270
Capstone Coach 1: And or you're thinking about purchasing, then you want to follow on a regular basis and, but I still want to make sure that the gui works for any other stock.

663
01:21:56.190 --> 01:21:57.030
Capstone Coach 1: that's the idea.

664
01:21:57.810 --> 01:21:59.520

730
01:26:19.230 --> 01:26:22.500
Wright, Elizabeth Harrison: Is that line run by itself, if you were to just run that was.

731

Karen Fireman: actually did do that earlier in the terminal but not here, I didn't think i'm doing it here.

750
01:27:33.630 --> 01:27:36.120
Capstone Coach 1: or should it should basically.

01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:17.700
Karen Fireman: it's weird because it just sits there and says it's installed.

758
01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:28.890
Capstone Coach 1: While you're in your youth you typed in the whole thing it didn't run just number three see the light yellow line now I don't know what.

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.360
Capstone Coach 1: Well wow.

764
01:28:50.970 --> 01:28:51.810
Karen Fireman: You saw me typing.

765
01:28:58.050 --> 01:28:58.680
Capstone Coach 1: It would.

766
01:29:04.530 --> 01:29:13.170
Capstone Coach 1: So it's not even doing what you're asking it to do, in other words you're just asking it just import the library by itself right.

767
01:29:14.130 --> 01:29:15.750
Karen Fireman: So why not why wouldn't do that.

768
01:29:16.410 --> 01:29:21.900
Capstone Coach 1: And instead it's it's going back to the others statement so.

769
01:29:22.110 --> 01:29:23.460
Karen Fireman: i'm interested to Colonel again.

770
01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:26.160
Capstone Coach 1: You know, do well.

771
01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:42.210
Capstone Coach 1: You should be able, just to say important matt plots live by itself, and this should not get any.

772
01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.610
Karen Fireman: I literally just typed it in.

773
01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:51.060
Capstone Coach 1: It could be that may be.

774
01:29:53.280 --> 01:30:00.930
Capstone Coach 1: P white blood is a method is if it's a add into math pod live and maybe somehow it has gotten.

775
01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:03.630
Capstone Coach 1: damaged.

776
01:30:06.330 --> 01:30:06.780
Swanson J, Charles Richard: say what.

777
01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:16.740
Swanson J, Charles Richard: Karen you are coming out important matt plot lab is pipeline and and just replace it with that import a map plot.

778
01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:26.310
Karen Fireman: He wants star just by itself.

779
01:30:26.610 --> 01:30:30.540
Swanson J, Charles Richard: Just by itself, and then highlight that line and execute that line.

780
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:39.240
Karen Fireman: I didn't.

781
01:30:39.690 --> 01:30:44.070
Capstone Coach 1: see his spider is not behaving the way it's supposed to be.

782
01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:48.690
Karen Fireman: So can I like get rid of it and start over again is that what I should.

783
01:30:48.690 --> 01:30:49.230
Capstone Coach 1: be no I.

784
01:30:49.290 --> 01:30:51.900
Capstone Coach 1: wouldn't know I think you're gonna have to reinstall spider.

785
01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:54.180
Karen Fireman: Well, if I reinstalled let me.

786
01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:56.130
Karen Fireman: just see.

787
01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:00.810
Capstone Coach 1: me right now what's what version of spider are you running.

788
01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:02.160
i'm not sure.

789
01:31:04.530 --> 01:31:05.700
Capstone Coach 1: If you go by yeah.

790
01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:07.830
Karen Fireman: One 4.0 point one.

791
01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:08.880
Okay.

792
01:31:09.930 --> 01:31:19.770
Capstone Coach 1: go up to the last wheel there to the right upper right since let you know, the one that said this one yeah that one update application.

793
01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:24.690
Wright, Elizabeth Harrison: yeah cuz i'm running 4.1 point three right now.

794
01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:26.310
Karen Fireman: Okay.

795
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:29.130
Capstone Coach 1: yeah we all are running a newer version.

796
01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:31.440
Karen Fireman: See, but this one, you want this one or the or newer.

797
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:39.420
Capstone Coach 1: Just try that well since we all are running I think I think my version, let me see what my version is hang on.

798
01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:42.120
Karen Fireman: works right yes.

799
01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:46.620
Capstone Coach 1: i'm ready for one for.

800
01:31:48.810 --> 01:31:49.350
Capstone Coach 1: But.

801
01:31:51.240 --> 01:32:11.100
Capstone Coach 1: Now I don't know how long this is going to take, but I think you're I think some reason, there are some key files inside of anaconda that control this sort of behavior, and so it looks to me like somehow some of your files might have gotten whacked or something like that.

802
01:32:12.690 --> 01:32:27.030
Capstone Coach 1: Maybe it's a bug within spider it could that that's also possible but upgrading spider to a newer version I think will be probably solve your problem, but I.

803
01:32:27.510 --> 01:32:27.840
know.

804
01:32:29.820 --> 01:32:31.890
Capstone Coach 1: What you're showing us just doesn't.

805
01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:33.570
Karen Fireman: doesn't make sense to.

806
01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:35.580
Karen Fireman: get out of this It just seems like an infinite loop.

832
01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:07.350
Karen Fireman: Your it what what what way would I redo anaconda I mean, is it likely anaconda not just spiders that likely anacondas messed up.

833
01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:26.190
Capstone Coach 1: No, but all and kind of doing is it's like a rapper for all these applications right here, you actually have spider installed as a separate APP I least found my machine, if you look at if I look at my Apps i'll see as a spider today, and my list of Apps I think when we check.

834
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:27.060
right here.

835
01:34:34.290 --> 01:34:37.020
Capstone Coach 1: No, I don't I don't have spider as a separate APP but.
