00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:14.430
Christian Gover: Hello.

2
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.180
Christian Gover: hey how are you.

3
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.250
Faculty Office Hours: Christian.

4
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:21.570
Christian Gover: Yes, me.

5
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.520
Faculty Office Hours: What do you what's up.

6
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.360
Christian Gover: Oh, nothing just the homework again.

7
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:40.680
Christian Gover: it's uh yeah this one took a while I had a lot of questions on on like the first problem, and then the fourth one down the second and third were easy but.

8
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:47.730
Christian Gover: yeah I just I guess I didn't understand very well what what's being asked on on number one.

9
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:50.520
Faculty Office Hours: Okay well.

10
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.770
Faculty Office Hours: So.

11
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.630
Faculty Office Hours: There, there are different types of decision variables in that problem.

12
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.370
Faculty Office Hours: mm hmm and what i'm asking you to do is to solve it.

13
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.760
Faculty Office Hours: And then fix some of the decision variables and then solve it again.

14
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.720
Christian Gover: yeah so.

15
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.680
Christian Gover: I use that word fix right go ahead.

16
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:24.300
Christian Gover: yeah I was just saying that I use that keyword fix like how we did in one of the assignments, I think it was either assignment six or seven.

17
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:37.410
Christian Gover: We fixed a value right, so I I did do that, after the first solved statement and then ran it again with the second self statement it looked like not very much changed.

18
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.770
Faculty Office Hours: Well, I don't know that you are going to expect much to change in the solution.

19
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.150
Faculty Office Hours: yeah you're.

20
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.880
Faculty Office Hours: you're fixing the variables that the best values.

21
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.600
Right.

22
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:56.310
Faculty Office Hours: it's just in this case it's a question of what what you see that the pre solver is able to do.

23
00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:17.580
Christian Gover: yeah I mean so like it's asking like what what a variables and constraints are removed and I didn't see any changes there, I mean I did see that the category of the constraint change from I guess it move some to fixed.

24
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:20.970
Christian Gover: But yeah so I don't know what.

25
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.610
Faculty Office Hours: Do you want to you want to share your screen.

26
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.050
Christian Gover: yeah Let me share.

27
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:25.650
Okay.

28
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.560
let's see.

29
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:35.340
Christian Gover: Let me pull the.

30
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.060
Christian Gover: SAS here.

31
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:46.980
Christian Gover: let's thinking.

32
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.230
Faculty Office Hours: that's a good sign.

33
00:11:51.690 --> 00:12:10.560
Christian Gover: Okay, I have yeah exercise one here, so all I did was just after the solve right in the printing I fixed all the values here just because I, you know, I was trying to do it in the loop or whatever, but I couldn't get the fixed statement to work in a for loop.

34
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.620
Faculty Office Hours: i'm not sure that i'm seeing your sass.

35
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:18.840
Christian Gover: Okay i'll let me stop sharing here and share again.

36
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.160
Christian Gover: screen line.

37
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.500
Faculty Office Hours: now looks better.

38
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:26.670
yeah.

39
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:36.660
Faculty Office Hours: Okay now so well, let me just point out that you're you're probably doing more work than you need to there in the sense that.

40
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:42.810
Faculty Office Hours: The the fix will allow you to fix.

41
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.560
Faculty Office Hours: Things to their current value.

42
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.620
Faculty Office Hours: Without typing the value.

43
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.740
Faculty Office Hours: So the fix to fix has the equal something as an optional argument.

44
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:04.230
Christian Gover: Okay, so I guess non prod already has the values after you saw right.

45
00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:05.370
Faculty Office Hours: Correct yes.

46
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:13.470
Christian Gover: Okay yeah I didn't know that, so I yeah I was kind of wondering that so I just do like fix num pride I don't have to set of value to it.

47
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.020
Faculty Office Hours: that's correct and in this particular case.

48
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.190
Faculty Office Hours: Okay now why don't you just run your code, let me.

49
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:21.510
Yes, save.

50
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:23.610
Christian Gover: run.

51
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.500
Faculty Office Hours: No we're not expecting it to come up with a different answer.

52
00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:30.810
Christian Gover: mm hmm.

53
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.500
Faculty Office Hours: Because like I said you're fixing them at the best values.

54
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:36.900
Christian Gover: yeah.

55
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.030
Faculty Office Hours: So let's just check the to.

56
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:45.840
Faculty Office Hours: check the salt statements here, so are they coming up with the same value in the salts.

57
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:52.530
Christian Gover: yeah let's go look at that here and solutions summary, is it or you're talking about.

58
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.840
Faculty Office Hours: The solution summary is fine, so it's like.

59
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.920
Faculty Office Hours: 179 and change what's what's the second one.

60
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:04.740
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so it looks the same.

61
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.140
Faculty Office Hours: yep go to the log file.

62
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:16.500
Faculty Office Hours: So what i'm interested in is is in the what the pre solver is able to do for the second problem.

63
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:24.600
Christian Gover: To like here, right after we fix the num pride in this.

64
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:29.490
Faculty Office Hours: In those notes that follow yeah So what does it tell you about what the result or does.

65
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.910
Christian Gover: let's see.

66
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.890
Christian Gover: 36 linear constraints.

67
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.470
Christian Gover: yeah and then it says 130 linear.

68
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.500
Christian Gover: Zero linear constraints.

69
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:47.970
Faculty Office Hours: Zero nonlinear.

70
00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:49.710
Christian Gover: nonlinear sorry.

71
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:55.110
Faculty Office Hours: that's Okay, I mean it's not your problem, so what is it telling you about the pre solver.

72
00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.110
Christian Gover: Pretty solver.

73
00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.660
Christian Gover: Automatic is apply I don't know what that means exactly.

74
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.310
Faculty Office Hours: that's just the default value.

75
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:06.120
Christian Gover: yeah.

76
00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.140
Faculty Office Hours: The default value is between moderate and aggressive.

77
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:16.350
Faculty Office Hours: Okay that's not important to the next slide is really what what we're looking for here.

78
00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:21.960
Christian Gover: I just removed all variables and constraints excellent.

79
00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.820
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so so basically the solver didn't have to do any work at all.

80
00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:28.410
Christian Gover: Oh.

81
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:41.670
Christian Gover: awesome that's pretty cool, I guess, I was just looking at the results and seeing that you know it's still saying that I have 84 variables still and 36 constraints.

82
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:42.870
Faculty Office Hours: Right so that's.

83
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.010
Christian Gover: Looking at the log.

84
00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:48.960
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so that's before the pre solver tries to simplify the problem.

85
00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.710
Christian Gover: Okay, I thought this was executed after it solved it.

86
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:02.760
Faculty Office Hours: Will will, it is the table is produced after it's solved, but in that table what you see is the characteristics of the problem.

87
00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:08.610
Faculty Office Hours: Before summary so you can think of the problem summary is kind of being before.

88
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:09.660
Faculty Office Hours: Although it's.

89
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:19.470
Faculty Office Hours: Not necessarily generated before it could be, and the solution summary table incorporates information about the solve.

90
00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:39.810
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, but the solution summary doesn't have the details about what the pre solvers able to do look, if you look down just a little bit and look at that solution summary table, the only thing that it tells you about the pre solver is how much time it took.

91
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.510
Christian Gover: Okay.

92
00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.150
Faculty Office Hours: It doesn't indicate how successful it was.

93
00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.970
Faculty Office Hours: In order to to find that out, you need to go look in the log.

94
00:16:52.290 --> 00:17:05.310
Faculty Office Hours: Although it does tell you that there was zero iterations so I guess, in that sense it's kind of a clue that the pre solver was pretty successful because it didn't have to do any iterations to solve the problem right.

95
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.630
Christian Gover: It was pretty exactly what the what the optimal values are any pink.

96
00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:20.250
Faculty Office Hours: ya know you might think that it's kind of unfair, because when you started solving that problem all of the values were the best values, to begin with.

97
00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:39.060
Faculty Office Hours: But I believe I mentioned earlier in the class that the the the LP solvers ignore the initial values of the decision variables so, even though the best values were already there, the only ones that it could really take advantage of were the ones that were fixed.

98
00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:41.700
Christian Gover: Okay.

99
00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:50.520
Faculty Office Hours: The only solvers that use the initial values of the decision variables are the nlp solvers the ones will learn about this week.

100
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:57.510
Faculty Office Hours: So it's not as it's not as easy to proposition, as it seems like it might be.

101
00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:58.530
mm hmm.

102
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:02.640
Christian Gover: Okay.

103
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:05.400
Christian Gover: Pretty cool.

104
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:10.080
Faculty Office Hours: So tell me about tell me about your progress in the last one.

105
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.760
Christian Gover: Oh, my God yeah.

106
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:35.850
Christian Gover: I didn't make much progress, I guess, I was a little bit confused too, so you know what's what's being asked here I I mean I think when I initially read it, I thought that the problem was already optimized right at 100 minutes or less for the the two tours from the Vance.

107
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:43.620
Faculty Office Hours: Sure, so, so the what the make span objective is is it's the larger of the two.

108
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:45.840
Christian Gover: yeah I saw that.

109
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:46.740
Christian Gover: code here.

110
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.540
Faculty Office Hours: Right, so, in other words, when you.

111
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:57.210
Faculty Office Hours: When you minimize the make span that tells you that the best you can do to get all of the bags delivered as 100 minutes.

112
00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.010
Faculty Office Hours: Now.

113
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:10.290
Faculty Office Hours: It could be that one of the routes takes 100 minutes, and the other route takes two minutes yeah, it would still the main span would still be 100.

114
00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:11.610
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

115
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:22.620
Christian Gover: I tried putting like less than or equal to like 98 or something to see if that would reduce it, but then, when I ran it it just kept going and over over.

116
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.560
Faculty Office Hours: we're not going to be able to reduce the make span.

117
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:35.130
Faculty Office Hours: What we might be able to reduce is the time it takes the quicker route to get finished.

118
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:50.520
Faculty Office Hours: So in this case, you really need to change the objective, so the objectives you that you want instead of the make span is the total combined time of the two bands.

119
00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.310
Jim Clark: yeah that's what I did.

120
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.790
Faculty Office Hours: So go down to where your objective is.

121
00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:08.790
Faculty Office Hours: Can you change that objective to be the total time total transit time or time used by both bands.

122
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:15.480
Christian Gover: The, I guess, I could use like I don't know.

123
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.770
Christian Gover: I know i'm kind of hard coding here but.

124
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.410
Christian Gover: I think yeah we don't use zero as a next.

125
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:36.810
Faculty Office Hours: Right, so in this case, you could do that that would be fine you might want to call it something other than the makes them but that's Okay, you could probably come up with a more general.

126
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:47.100
Faculty Office Hours: approach, but this would certainly work for two for two vans right yeah now why don't you go ahead and just run it and see what happens.

127
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:49.020
Christian Gover: And this.

128
00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.050
Christian Gover: Little man.

129
00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.800
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so where's the solution let's go down to that.

130
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:05.340
Christian Gover: Oh it's only one.

131
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:11.190
Faculty Office Hours: So it's only one vehicle now does that make sense let's think about it, if.

132
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:18.600
Faculty Office Hours: If if you had to make two trips, you have to kind of go back to the airport right.

133
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.150
Faculty Office Hours: So.

134
00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:35.430
Faculty Office Hours: Two vans is always going to take more time than just one Ben would, but the real question here is what's the smallest combine travel time subject to.

135
00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:41.640
Faculty Office Hours: Both vans getting done in less than or equal to 100 minutes.

136
00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:58.110
Faculty Office Hours: So we want to make sure that the make span is small, we want to make sure that the make span is at most 100 and then we want to find the best solution that minimizes the total transit time.

137
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.310
Faculty Office Hours: So so go back to your make spend constraint.

138
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:09.900
Christian Gover: Here yep.

139
00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:15.300
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so the problem here is that Max time use can be anything now.

140
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:20.520
Faculty Office Hours: yeah but you don't want it to be anything you don't want it to be more than 100.

141
00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:30.510
Christian Gover: So right seen it.

142
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.420
Faculty Office Hours: Close but we can't have strict inequalities.

143
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:34.770
Oh.

144
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:41.850
Faculty Office Hours: there's some kind of technical reasons for that, so you want to put a n equals after that.

145
00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:48.090
Christian Gover: Oh, maybe that's why I was having I saw that error message I was like what's wrong with doing that.

146
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:54.990
Faculty Office Hours: Well, the reason is kind of a technical mathematical reason, and the reason is that.

147
00:22:56.250 --> 00:23:04.020
Faculty Office Hours: You don't always have a solution there's not always an optimal solution when you have strict inequality is is kind of like you know what zeno's paradox is.

148
00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:05.490
Now.

149
00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:10.830
Faculty Office Hours: He knows paradoxes that let's say you.

150
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.010
Faculty Office Hours: You run 100 yard dash.

151
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:28.740
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so you run the first 50 yards, and then the next 25 and the next 12 and a half, and you keep getting half as close to the finish line mm hmm.

152
00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.010
Faculty Office Hours: But you might never get there.

153
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.440
Christian Gover: yeah that's true.

154
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:46.080
Faculty Office Hours: So the reason that we can't have strict inequality is is because the the optimal solution in the limit would exist, but it would be equal to the.

155
00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:53.610
Faculty Office Hours: To the right hand side of the limit, so we only can allow less than or equal to so let's see what happens now let's try it now and see what happens.

156
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:02.760
Faculty Office Hours: Those your helpers.

157
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.160
Faculty Office Hours: In the background.

158
00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:05.970
Jim Clark: let's be.

159
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.210
Christian Gover: My helpers yeah my minions.

160
00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:10.590
Christian Gover: You know, calm.

161
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.910
Faculty Office Hours: So what does this solution look like this time.

162
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.740
Jim Clark: looks like mine, good.

163
00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:34.710
Faculty Office Hours: So appears to be the same one yeah but but there's not necessarily a bad thing it just appears to say in this case you can't do any better.

164
00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:40.890
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, it was it was possible that there might have been a better solution.

165
00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:47.310
Faculty Office Hours: But we wouldn't know that unless we made some modifications and and and tested it.

166
00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:54.870
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so so what would you adventure.

167
00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:05.160
Faculty Office Hours: So you just you don't think that you understood what the question was asking well enough, is that most of the problem.

168
00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:11.370
Christian Gover: He yeah, I guess, I thought that it was already optimized right from like lectures and.

169
00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.450
Faculty Office Hours: Right yeah so I did we were just talking about a different objective.

170
00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:16.620
Okay.

171
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:25.470
Christian Gover: I guess that's true, but what happens if you change this to like a lower number I guess it would it keep writing.

172
00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:26.550
Faculty Office Hours: we'll just try it.

173
00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:28.290
Faculty Office Hours: let's try.

174
00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.870
Christian Gover: I don't know 999 I guess.

175
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:31.560
Okay.

176
00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:34.350
Christian Gover: Do I.

177
00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.820
Faculty Office Hours: just go ahead and run it.

178
00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:49.350
Christian Gover: doesn't keep running like when I set the Max time limit to.

179
00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:51.780
Christian Gover: 98.

180
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:54.060
Christian Gover: It is kept spanning.

181
00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:58.950
Faculty Office Hours: I think you should be able to kill it if it's not stopping but that's okay.

182
00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.680
Christian Gover: yeah it looks like it's doing what it did yesterday.

183
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:08.520
Faculty Office Hours: So.

184
00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.680
Christian Gover: He knows paradise.

185
00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:15.060
Faculty Office Hours: Ultimately, it will determine that the problem is in feasible.

186
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:15.900
Christian Gover: yeah.

187
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:17.850
Faculty Office Hours: But it might take a while.

188
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:19.800
Christian Gover: Okay i'm gonna kill it.

189
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:24.300
Faculty Office Hours: that's fine I think you can go to the code yeah okay.

190
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:27.150
Faculty Office Hours: So try something bigger now.

191
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:31.770
Christian Gover: being too aggressive.

192
00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:36.750
Faculty Office Hours: Give yourself a little bit more space in that lane you like cheese, you know, then try it now.

193
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:51.990
Faculty Office Hours: So now it might be that it found a better solution, it might be that that's the best that it could do it see.

194
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.120
Christian Gover: I have looks a little different.

195
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:57.060
Faculty Office Hours: So let's go up to where it shows you the objective.

196
00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.850
Faculty Office Hours: To go up to the solution summary.

197
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:07.170
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so there, it found when you gave yourself a little more slack in terms of the make span.

198
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:09.750
Faculty Office Hours: As able to reduce the total.

199
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.060
Faculty Office Hours: The total time.

200
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.930
Faculty Office Hours: The combined time of both routes.

201
00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:17.910
Christian Gover: Okay.

202
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.380
Faculty Office Hours: not know nothing that's going to impact your answer at all, but.

203
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:24.660
Christian Gover: yeah.

204
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:34.980
Faculty Office Hours: yeah this is kind of a trade off if you if you're willing to sacrifice a little bit in the make span, you might be able to reduce the total combined time.

205
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.100
Christian Gover: And yeah.

206
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:48.240
Faculty Office Hours: But when you when you minimize the make span it wants to do the best that it can, on the one that takes the longest time.

207
00:27:48.990 --> 00:28:01.080
Faculty Office Hours: But it doesn't really care about the one that's second best it could be, they could both be 100 and it makes bad is 100 or one could be the 100 and the other could be 20 and it's still have a make span of 100 100.

208
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:07.350
Faculty Office Hours: doesn't it doesn't try to push the other one down.

209
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.080
Faculty Office Hours: But you just you were just able to show that it couldn't have done any better anyway so.

210
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:22.470
Christian Gover: Okay pretty cool yeah this wouldn't worked in the past 100 minute mark right.

211
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.150
Christian Gover: Right okay.

212
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:28.290
Christian Gover: Well that's very helpful, thank you.

213
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:34.680
Faculty Office Hours: yeah and and making those modifications to the code.

214
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:36.210
Faculty Office Hours: Is.

215
00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:41.220
Faculty Office Hours: Mostly intended to kind of get you started thinking about the project.

216
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.150
Faculty Office Hours: yeah you could probably guess that but.

217
00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:54.360
Christian Gover: Okay yeah we kind of started our project yesterday, but I don't think we got to fight.

218
00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:00.570
Jim Clark: yeah that's what I keep telling myself this is this is for the next one.

219
00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:03.210
Christian Gover: yeah jim's on my team to say.

220
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.540
Faculty Office Hours: Oh yeah my condolences.

221
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.010
Christian Gover: Now he's good Thank you.

222
00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:14.610
Faculty Office Hours: You are unsure now.

223
00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:15.960
Christian Gover: yeah I was unsure.

224
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.600
Jim Clark: what's next.

225
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:32.280
Jim Clark: So number two is something I had never won done the hard way.

226
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.160
Jim Clark: But I think October so getting there.

227
00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.330
Okay.

228
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.700
Jim Clark: But we're I thought I.

229
00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:45.150
Jim Clark: was working in number two I thought I had solved and then suddenly it seemed to.

230
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:49.680
Jim Clark: me when I start trying to use number three suddenly number two seem to.

231
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.540
Jim Clark: Like give me what I need to do number three so I really kept.

232
00:29:56.190 --> 00:30:13.230
Jim Clark: I really keep getting confused about trying to run the code, you know in in the MIT version versus just a LP version to get you know, to get basically a best bound than the best and the best energy and I just keep.

233
00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:15.090
Faculty Office Hours: Do you want to share your code.

234
00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.380
sure.

235
00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:21.810
Jim Clark: Probably go for myself one it's so.

236
00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:27.390
Jim Clark: Rare I thought I had it and then I look at it like it's not like.

237
00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:31.620
Jim Clark: Alright, so this is right.

238
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.860
Jim Clark: And i'm also trying to put put this into.

239
00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:42.480
Jim Clark: That baggage delivery go to.

240
00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:50.880
Jim Clark: So I can collect me share I did this, the hard way.

241
00:30:53.250 --> 00:31:07.830
Jim Clark: So for question to how was running it was I was trying to make sure that I had was running it without the energy in the numbers and that may have been wrong, so I keep.

242
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:16.050
Jim Clark: Talking myself out of one way or the other but I was thinking that that's one of the steps is to break down prod and energy, then running it that way.

243
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.990
Faculty Office Hours: Right, but you want to take your fixes out.

244
00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.730
Jim Clark: Oh, I thought that was necessarily the fixtures in.

245
00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:25.290
know.

246
00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:32.010
Faculty Office Hours: If any if you if you fix them some of the values aren't integers.

247
00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:33.480
Jim Clark: Okay, then.

248
00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:37.230
Faculty Office Hours: Go it'll give you an in feasibility so just comment those all out.

249
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:43.620
Jim Clark: Okay that's that I was thinking that that was vital so now, I know that that's a big improvement.

250
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:44.760
Jim Clark: So, unless you.

251
00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:46.590
Faculty Office Hours: Try and run it and see what happens.

252
00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:48.660
Jim Clark: save it.

253
00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:55.560
Jim Clark: They.

254
00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.580
Jim Clark: have a problem, my head, I have a clean one.

255
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.650
I hate it when that happens.

256
00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:14.190
Jim Clark: You really know what I did okay so Okay, this is this has entered your setup so i'm getting i'm getting best band, and the best editor.

257
00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.360
Faculty Office Hours: So that's it yeah if you look at the results.

258
00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:22.260
Faculty Office Hours: You can see those in the solution summary table.

259
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:27.480
Faculty Office Hours: you'll see there the.

260
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:39.270
Jim Clark: This looks the way it's supposed to best bound here at best bound it's not the same OK, so my my concept problems, I thought I had to lock in a keep those numbers.

261
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:47.760
Jim Clark: With the problem number one okay so with that, then I should be able to estimate best down at best energy from exercise to okay.

262
00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:51.630
Jim Clark: yep yep so kind of that that one concept.

263
00:32:52.800 --> 00:33:01.800
Jim Clark: All right, well, I think that gets me the Foundation to finish number two and start on numbers start on number three so, then let me ask the follow up question.

264
00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:15.480
Jim Clark: The same thing when you're running question number two Problem number three you also are not trying to set the the that those numbers for each of those months you're just running it running it while the three.

265
00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:22.710
Faculty Office Hours: Right yeah and then the connection between one and two and three, is that.

266
00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:32.610
Faculty Office Hours: What is kind of intended to guide you that it is enough to just set the nonprofit values to be integers.

267
00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:37.680
Faculty Office Hours: You don't need to set I mean you could you could set them all to be integers.

268
00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:55.140
Faculty Office Hours: But because, once you fix the non prod variables, the other ones are really just kind of a really simple calculation for the solver it's only necessary to to to use the integral part for those non prod variables.

269
00:33:55.290 --> 00:34:03.570
Faculty Office Hours: He checked because there's like eight of them, and you could you could put them all to be integral but it might come up with a slightly different solution.

270
00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:07.860
Jim Clark: Right Okay, but that's that's a big help.

271
00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:10.530
Faculty Office Hours: Sure it's not going to be.

272
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:14.220
Faculty Office Hours: it's not going to help you very much, but I would say that.

273
00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:27.990
Faculty Office Hours: If if you run into a problem, like that you think you know it's it's not working it's not clear to me what i'm doing wrong, the best thing is just to send me an email with your log.

274
00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:29.670
Jim Clark: Okay.

275
00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:33.300
Faculty Office Hours: And i'll be happy to kind of point you in the right direction.

276
00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:37.200
Jim Clark: Okay, but before I just sent a email us at help.

277
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:44.520
Jim Clark: But, but it would be beneficial, but say help but here's the deal, so I.

278
00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.020
Jim Clark: appreciate that.

279
00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:49.590
Faculty Office Hours: And the reason why the log is good, is because.

280
00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.880
Faculty Office Hours: I can read the log it's just a text file.

281
00:34:55.410 --> 00:34:57.420
Faculty Office Hours: Even if I don't have access to SAS.

282
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:06.270
Jim Clark: Right, I can, I understand, while you're while you're it tells you what's what's actually happening inside the code to.

283
00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:08.760
Jim Clark: Okay, thank you.

284
00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:11.340
Jim Clark: Sure i'll yield the floor.

285
00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.300
Faculty Office Hours: speaker will recognize anyone who has a question.

286
00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:47.760
Jim Clark: i'm not gonna ask her number three because I had to face number two but number three I think role roles, for if I if I get number two dead right so.

287
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:51.900
Faculty Office Hours: yeah and then, and we did we did something similar in class.

288
00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:55.620
Jim Clark: Right, so I had that to kind of go back and look at.

289
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:56.670
Okay.

290
00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:05.640
Jim Clark: I do appreciate the fact that the school record collectors that gets IP go back and look at it.

291
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:11.070
Jim Clark: So thank you for for making sure that recording.

292
00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:13.560
Faculty Office Hours: yeah well, it has nothing to do with.

293
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:17.160
Jim Clark: I know I know inside you, but I just i'm just saying what would I you know.

294
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.000
Faculty Office Hours: I got I got.

295
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:19.500
Jim Clark: I go down these different.

296
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:25.860
Jim Clark: Different rabbit trails when I say not just didn't make sense I know he talked about this, where do I find it so.

297
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:32.130
Faculty Office Hours: yeah Javier is the one to think or or myra and or the text I guess.

298
00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:33.360
Faculty Office Hours: You actually do the work.

299
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:52.260
yeah my question was related to number four but it's already clear now that you went through it with Christian the question wasn't really clear to me exactly what we needed to do because I thought it was already optimized so.

300
00:36:53.490 --> 00:37:05.370
Faculty Office Hours: I get it now, thank you okay yeah sure and anytime you need clarification like that, just like just you know fire me off an email Okay, thank you mm hmm.

301
00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:25.500
Lippert, Nathan: Dr hartman it's kind of kind of came partway through when you're explaining Christians, but so our group was looking at the second bullet so in baggage delivery model for the group project is that kind of the same thing you're walking through with them in terms of how we would go about.

302
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.290
Lippert, Nathan: kind of adjusting that code for.

303
00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:30.390
Faculty Office Hours: Let me see, let me get my my bullets.

304
00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:41.940
Faculty Office Hours: Why don't I don't think I had to print out for the baggage library, but yeah it's I think that's that's basically the same question it's just that it's not.

305
00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:44.880
Faculty Office Hours: It.

306
00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:53.340
Faculty Office Hours: yeah it's just maybe not not so specific yeah but it's the same idea, the question is.

307
00:37:55.290 --> 00:38:02.520
Faculty Office Hours: If you know if you put a bow on the make span, can you minimize the total combined travel time.

308
00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:09.030
Lippert, Nathan: It had a aspect of it to with regards to pre processing that we would no longer need to do.

309
00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:14.250
Lippert, Nathan: that's not in the may expand constraint would be or.

310
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:18.930
Faculty Office Hours: No, so that the The pre processing is it is kind of.

311
00:38:21.090 --> 00:38:26.040
Faculty Office Hours: try and explain it but it's it's it's not nothing you need to worry about so.

312
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:33.060
Faculty Office Hours: In the the the original problem it's from this.

313
00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:40.260
Faculty Office Hours: British book and the guy well, I mean I guess you could guess because it's takes place in England, but.

314
00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:51.120
Faculty Office Hours: So he just put down the travel times and I guess he just kind of eyeball that and the problem is that.

315
00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.280
Faculty Office Hours: There are.

316
00:38:54.570 --> 00:39:02.310
Faculty Office Hours: Some times, where it's faster to go from A to B to C than it is to go from A to C.

317
00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:13.770
Faculty Office Hours: So distances should satisfy something called the triangle and equality, which means it's it's always faster to go directly there then go in indirectly there.

318
00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:33.540
Faculty Office Hours: But because he didn't have distances that satisfied the triangle and equality it's possible that the best routes would visit some of the some of the nodes multiple times, and so, if your if your formulation.

319
00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:46.800
Faculty Office Hours: doesn't allow that, then you kind of run into some difficulties, but when you when you use Google maps to find the shortest travel times it's always going to.

320
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.990
Faculty Office Hours: obey the triangle inequality it's never going to allow you to kind of like.

321
00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:57.570
Faculty Office Hours: freelance it and find a faster way to go, then then Google maps.

322
00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:01.920
Faculty Office Hours: So it's just not something you just don't need to worry about.

323
00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:14.940
Lippert, Nathan: Okay, so they the Google algorithm or maps algorithm is already taking care of that triangle of inequality and we would see that if we adjust the graphs in terms of like the visiting multiple spots more than once.

324
00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:18.570
Faculty Office Hours: Well, you would see it if you checked if there was any shortcuts.

325
00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:22.080
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, if you if you if you tested to see if.

326
00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:43.920
Faculty Office Hours: You know, for every every three nodes that it was always better to go directly than to go via some other node and then come back like I said from A to B to C, as opposed to do directly from A to C, but you don't have to you know something something i'm expecting you to test or anything.

327
00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:51.060
Faculty Office Hours: it's just a the code might not work unless that was true.

328
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:52.380
Lippert, Nathan: Okay.

329
00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:55.140
Faculty Office Hours: But it's true so you have to worry about it.

330
00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:56.760
Lippert, Nathan: Okay, thank you.

331
00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:57.450
mm hmm.

332
00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:25.200
Faculty Office Hours: So if you if you look at the.

333
00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:34.110
Faculty Office Hours: The the PDF slides for this week, this coming week, there is a slide on there about.

334
00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:48.000
Faculty Office Hours: Some other things that make a good kind of intermediate steps for the project, so if you want to look at that that might give you some something else to think about.

335
00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:51.450
Jim Clark: Okay, well, I appreciate it that's.

336
00:41:51.870 --> 00:42:01.860
Faculty Office Hours: yeah sure, but I mean i'll i'll talk through it, on Thursday, but i'm only just saying, if your group is getting into it and you're looking for for hints or whatever.

337
00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:06.540
Jim Clark: Okay.

338
00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:51.210
Jim Clark: I think i've got what I need for number two so now i'm working on number three so I.

339
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:55.080
Jim Clark: working.

340
00:42:56.490 --> 00:43:00.480
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so the example that we did in class that relates to number three.

341
00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.100
Faculty Office Hours: Is.

342
00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:03.840
Faculty Office Hours: So we.

343
00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:12.270
Faculty Office Hours: We were looking at the the piece wise linear approximation for the for the.

344
00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:16.050
Faculty Office Hours: For the flights.

345
00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:26.610
Faculty Office Hours: In that mixed integer linear model and we solved it, and when we solved it it didn't give us an optimal solution.

346
00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:36.930
Faculty Office Hours: It had a gap right but we wanted to see what the optimal solution was so we changed the value of that solver option.

347
00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:46.170
Faculty Office Hours: in such a way that it forced it to find an optimal solution or force it to find a closer solution, which turned out to be optimal.

348
00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:51.030
Jim Clark: And I think that is also similar to.

349
00:43:52.860 --> 00:44:00.180
Jim Clark: homework 11 The fly, without going back I think that's where I was getting my first ideas on what to do.

350
00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:03.660
Faculty Office Hours: yeah yeah yeah very similar almost the same.

351
00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:04.290
So.

352
00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.340
Jim Clark: Alright cool Thank you i'll just proceed forward.

353
00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:15.690
Jim Clark: Unless someone's got a question think week we've covered at least one, two and four for me.

354
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:21.270
Jim Clark: And I think i'm close I could see I see my way to finish number three now so.

355
00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:22.950
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, good.

356
00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:26.940
Jim Clark: All right, well, thank you very much and we'll see you on Thursday night.

357
00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:28.680
Faculty Office Hours: you're going to be there, or just.

358
00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:38.160
Jim Clark: I will, I will be there, I i've kind of made the made the commitment that i'm safe, as I can be until just we're wearing the mask and.

359
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:41.250
Jim Clark: He was coming.

360
00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:49.530
Jim Clark: Thank one of our other students is going to be coming because they don't want me to eat all the food.

361
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:54.330
Jim Clark: hey that'll be pretty tough because I.

362
00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:57.570
Faculty Office Hours: Reason is there it's not possible eat all that food.

363
00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:04.740
Jim Clark: it's I can't yeah I can't eat that fruit that gives me anyway so anyway, but, but I will see you Thursday.

364
00:45:05.130 --> 00:45:06.150
Faculty Office Hours: Okay sounds good.

365
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.780

Brian Frankel?s iPhone: If i'll pay i'll pay you in.

371
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.740
Brian Frankel?s iPhone: dodge coin or bitcoin or something else.

372
00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:53.190
Faculty Office Hours: Who was it yeah someone was telling me about.

373
00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.790
Faculty Office Hours: Like a fake cryptocurrency that they invested in.

374
00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:08.460
Faculty Office Hours: Like django or something some I can't remember what it was, but it was something that somebody actually just made up but evidently ilan musk.

375
00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.310
Faculty Office Hours: must have.

376
00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:19.020
Faculty Office Hours: posted about it and then people started to believe that it was actually a real currency, and this, the value of gone up astronomically.

377
00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:23.790
Brian Frankel?s iPhone: i'm sure some people in our class have been affected by.

378
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:25.740
Faculty Office Hours: I think was called dose coin.

379
00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:39.570
Brian Frankel?s iPhone: Actually yeah that's that's the one the one with the dog on it yeah I don't know how to say it, but yeah ask Ryan David about that he loves that stuff him and Claire are big on it they're like context 14 cents I bought it when is it too so nonetheless.

380
00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:44.400
Brian Frankel?s iPhone: we'll we'll probably have a couple questions will.

381
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:55.470
Brian Frankel?s iPhone: Oh sorry just jump over Okay, no, I was gonna say well we'll probably have a couple questions from our group next week about the project and so next week you'll be able to discuss that with us right.

382
00:46:55.710 --> 00:47:01.500
Faculty Office Hours: yeah sure, and if you want to set up a zoom meeting just with your group that's fine too.

383
00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:09.870
Brian Frankel?s iPhone: Okay yeah we're working on that okay well that sounds good, well, thank you very much, I really appreciate it yeah.

384
00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:10.530

Faculty Office Hours: We were talking about.

395
00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:45.030
Faculty Office Hours: Just the best song.

396
00:53:46.140 --> 00:54:01.770
Faculty Office Hours: Thanks for sticking around if you stick around to the end and for joining us we you know we're very happy that you can we set everything up and everything like got some genki lights it's because it's very, very dark.

397
00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:03.180
Faculty Office Hours: and

398
00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:05.310
Faculty Office Hours: You can't.

399
00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:10.620
Faculty Office Hours: Any any wrap up thoughts from the obvious you can't just.

400
00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:12.930
Faculty Office Hours: it's just gone.

401
00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:19.290
Faculty Office Hours: Coming out of my favorite people and i'm trying to think about it, but I could decide.

402
00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:21.690
Faculty Office Hours: Sorry nice to know.

403
00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:24.180
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

404
00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:31.470
Faculty Office Hours: yeah that's okay.

405
00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:48.480
Faculty Office Hours: yeah we're not changing right now, but they don't changes, you know when we hit the road becomes a whole.

406
00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:55.440
Faculty Office Hours: yeah hey how about you interested in any any final final thoughts from the chat or just.

407
00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:06.300
Faculty Office Hours: Just gonna it's gonna be a lot of cleaning well, I think the drums.

408
00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:16.950
Faculty Office Hours: signal chain to change over engineering.

409
00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:24.960
Faculty Office Hours: neighbors know what does any extra work, but I just don't want to put the bag.

410
00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:28.050
Faculty Office Hours: To get me to get people.

411
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:30.540
Faculty Office Hours: going.

412
00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:39.870
Faculty Office Hours: behind it, you know anything anything with a good spring and like a real life, like my favorite drummer.

413
00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:47.820
Faculty Office Hours: Oh, my God it was one of the best from from the basic ban the we always love with the white.

414
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:52.770
Faculty Office Hours: Yes, so I can put my highlights like sandy paying us to do.

415
00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:56.280
Faculty Office Hours: he's a great drummer.

416
00:55:58.770 --> 00:56:01.200
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I want to give a quick shout out to a.

417
00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:06.690
Faculty Office Hours: Beautiful.

418
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.620
Faculty Office Hours: But.

419
00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:11.850
Faculty Office Hours: again.

420
00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:21.150
Faculty Office Hours: If you're a fan of the best you're probably like Red Bull is the great men from Chicago and we would go to go on in life to do like twitch live streams and then.

421
00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.400
Faculty Office Hours: If you want to watch me Jonathan.

422
00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:32.220
Faculty Office Hours: Long I guess you could just keep watching now or you could watch.

423
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:37.950
Faculty Office Hours: The new album princess princess table.

424
00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:49.380
Faculty Office Hours: Thank you Julia read for us.

425
00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:52.380
Faculty Office Hours: it's great when you're explaining something.

426
00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:56.610
Faculty Office Hours: Terrible.

427
00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:59.670
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, well, I guess, if not have known as David.

428
00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:09.990
Faculty Office Hours: Thanks so much for tuning in with this.

429
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:12.990
Faculty Office Hours: If you want to watch this video i'm.

430
00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:18.960
Faculty Office Hours: going to be, it should be live, so you can watch it and.

431
00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:24.000
Faculty Office Hours: Then you know you can you just click save.

432
00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:27.120
Faculty Office Hours: I spent I spent hours on these.

433
00:57:29.130 --> 00:57:32.370
Faculty Office Hours: um but yeah thanks so much for joining and.

434
