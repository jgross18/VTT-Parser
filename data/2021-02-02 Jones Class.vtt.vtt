Jones, Edward R: So.

Jones, Edward R: I wanted to mention that some of the things we're doing in class here should be on your resume you might think about putting them on your resume, especially if you're going to be looking for a job from somebody like Google or one of those kind of social media or computer places.

55
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:24.420
Jones, Edward R: So what can you put on your your your resume so far, well, you could say yeah I know how to do goose on Python I know I know about decanter.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:38.610
Jones, Edward R: I can, I can make movies, so I will put down on my little resume familiar with the counter and and Python gui construction on various platforms, you know.

57
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.270
Jones, Edward R: Well tonight you're going to be able to put another notch in your gun.

58
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.380
Jones, Edward R: Because tonight we're talking about Google cloud.

59
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:55.650
Jones, Edward R: And Google cloud is is not that old so you are you're going to be one of you may have some.

60
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.110
Jones, Edward R: leg up on some other people in terms of of this sort of thing because you're going to learn a lot about Google cloud.

61
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:14.700
Jones, Edward R: And, in particular, even now, this is why I say Oh, we have enough time here in two hours but we're going to be looking at language translation using Google cloud.

62
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:25.380
Jones, Edward R: So you're going to learn about what is Google cloud, how do I get to use it, what can I do for me if I want, if I do decide to use it, you know that sort of thing.

63
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.960
Jones, Edward R: So.

64
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.210
Jones, Edward R: What we're going to do, then tonight what i'd like to do is really look at three things.

65
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.270
Jones, Edward R: And hang on a second here.

66
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.920
Jones, Edward R: I need to.

67
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:49.890
Jones, Edward R: Know okay yeah good not can see the screen we're going to do three things number one we're going to look at the week to assignment review that'll be quite a quick.

68
00:05:50.400 --> 00:06:07.020
Jones, Edward R: And then we're going to talk about Google cloud and language translation translation and we're going to actually get into it with Python so by the time we get out of here tonight you'll be doing language translation, which is a lot of fun with Python, with the help of Google cloud.

69
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:18.450
Jones, Edward R: So let's first of all talk about yeah yes Simon last week, and this was not exactly heavily heavy lifting I hope you didn't have any trouble with it.

70
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.640
Jones, Edward R: My brother's calling me.

71
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:37.710
Jones, Edward R: He probably wants to know if i'm still alive okay i'll have to call them back so yeah the way week to assignment, if you have trouble with that assignment, let me know.

72
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:47.010
Jones, Edward R: Because it should have been fairly easily easy lifting, and the reason is what I did was I gave you a template.

73
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:58.590
Jones, Edward R: And i'm going to do the same thing again tonight I give you a program that's sort of like half constructed and then this case, the template was had the name plot gui P, why.

74
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:16.110
Jones, Edward R: And then you were asked to complete it by adding a frame in the upper right hand side with some stock selections there like moderna and that was so you have a you have a new thing you have to do, which is a frame inside of a frame.

75
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:25.080
Jones, Edward R: And then you have this check button it's called check button that you're going to be using and where you did use.

76
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:38.880
Jones, Edward R: And when somebody clicks on this chat button, well, it should complete the stock information, the current information for that stock and also show you the plot if one of these three buttons is.

77
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:54.120
Jones, Edward R: checked here, so in this case, closing price was checked So when I checked on moderna it showed the basic stock information on the left and then it also showed the closing price here on the right.

78
00:07:54.870 --> 00:08:01.020
Jones, Edward R: And, of course, more data has been doing quite well because they're getting a lot of the vaccine out to places that need it.

79
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:14.100
Jones, Edward R: And there's this, by the way, is a commercial organization and they do sell stock and so they're very happy well or not happy about the pandemic but it's her business so it's good that they're in the middle of it.

80
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.630
Jones, Edward R: Now let's go on and talk a little.

81
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.150
6 Aldin Dollens Laptop: Is anyone else, without audio.

82
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.060

112
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:24.690
6 Aldin Dollens Laptop: got a whole bunch of suckers to go over by those stocks and basically liquidate out of some of the the no means stock.

Karen Fireman: that's nice Jordan.

142
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.050
Jordan Gross: We have fun, you know.

143
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.610
Gupta, Satyam: We muted Dr Jones.

144
00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.490
Jones, Edward R: Okay, can you hear me.

145
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:54.780
Karen Fireman: Yes, sir.

146
00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:55.590
Jones, Edward R: Okay, good.

147
00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:58.800
Jones, Edward R: whoa.

148
00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:06.330
Jones, Edward R: wow Okay, let me share my screen back again and what happened was.

149
00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:13.110
Jones, Edward R: I was on I was on a network, we have two networks here and.

150
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.030
Jones, Edward R: share.

151
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:26.550
Jones, Edward R: And I was on a network that was open and the system said wait a minute there's someone attacking in and you need to get out of here and just dropping out.

152
00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:33.030
Jones, Edward R: So, then, I now back in the secure network, and so I think.

153
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.810
Jones, Edward R: we'll be okay now we'll see okay.

154
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:39.660
Jones, Edward R: Can you see my screen.

155
00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.550
Karen Fireman: Just a screen nothing on it, oh there we go yes.

156
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.670
Jones, Edward R: Okay okay so.

157
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.770
Jones, Edward R: hang on a SEC, going back to week three the E campus.

158
00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:01.020
Jones, Edward R: And we get back on the week three campus.

159
00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.530
Jones, Edward R: gonna have to download some more files.

160
00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:07.980
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

161
00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:14.340
Jones, Edward R: Okay, there we are so we have the lecture notes running right now.

162
00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:16.200
Jones, Edward R: and

163
00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:18.930
Jones, Edward R: i'm going to look at.

164
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:29.040
Jones, Edward R: Where we there is a solution to the week, this one right here this link right here, the second link is a solution to the week to assignment.

165
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:39.990
Jones, Edward R: So if you click that and download it you'll have the entire Code, the entire solution which produces that frame and all the little check buttons in there.

166
00:16:40.680 --> 00:17:00.990
Jones, Edward R: And what i'm doing now in the in the PowerPoint is showing you talking a little bit about how the frame is done so, this code is in that file and, if you look to do an edit on look for stock underscore frame you'll find this code and you'll see that it is being set up in column three.

167
00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:08.730
Jones, Edward R: And row number one now, why is it column three will because they because, on the mainframe.

168
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:24.480
Jones, Edward R: frame there's a frame called main frame we have three columns one, two and three, and so we wanted that new frame the stock frame to go in third column will be here on the far right.

169
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:32.880
Jones, Edward R: row well the room is officially we're going to put it in the upper left hand corner, right here that's rule number one.

170
00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:44.940
Jones, Edward R: So column three row number one is where i'm pointing to right now, now it says columns spanned six if you look at the number of checkboxes here there's more.

171
00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:52.380
Jones, Edward R: A row span equal to six or more than six like seven or eight or so checks things in here.

172
00:17:53.070 --> 00:18:00.900
Jones, Edward R: The six comes from the fact that the role they actually wrote counters right here, these entry, there are six entry boxes.

173
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:12.960
Jones, Edward R: So, as far as the mainframe is concerned mainframe is concerned, it sees you have three columns and six rows it right in this area.

174
00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:25.680
Jones, Edward R: There is a seventh row which contains the the checkboxes in the middle and then an eighth row which contains the label that it when, in which we inserted the graph.

175
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:39.990
Jones, Edward R: So sometimes this this column and row thing can be confusing, but you have to kind of remember that the column and row is relative to the perspective of the frame that you're putting this thing on.

176
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:52.050
Jones, Edward R: So we created a new frame stock frame and we're putting it on top of the mainframe but and from the mainframe view this is column three.

177
00:18:52.980 --> 00:19:03.090
Jones, Edward R: And then that little area that we're covering is that six rosen so that's why you have column equal to three and then row span equal to six.

178
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:12.330
Jones, Edward R: columns span equal to two white to Oh, my goodness, it looks like we only have one column inside of this frame.

179
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:25.560
Jones, Edward R: And that's true inside of this new frame, we only have one single column, but the span of this new frame is actually two columns So you can see these little check buttons on the bottom.

180
00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:40.950
Jones, Edward R: There are two chat buttons here they're actually in two different columns on mainframes mainframe has 1234 columns actually 1234.

181
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:54.030
Jones, Edward R: So this guy is going into column three but it's actually going to cover columns three and four on the mainframe mainframe is this whole picture here.

182
00:19:54.540 --> 00:20:12.450
Jones, Edward R: If you can so I just wanted to point that out, and we add in some extra batting 50 that's the left hand side and so that's that lip out and you see here that makes it look like everything is centered we actually cheated on I actually cheated on that split that extra betting right there.

183
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.630
Jones, Edward R: Okay, no.

184
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:21.720
Okay.

185
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:43.230
Jones, Edward R: See, where I will make sure you're there so yeah so then we set up these buttons that are inside that new frame now once we create that new frame these buttons are going to go in there, one on top of the other, this is the first button for IBM and it's in row one.

186
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:55.650
Jones, Edward R: column one because that know these numbers, the column numbers in here see we're using the stock frame we're using that little frame on the right hand side not mainframe.

187
00:20:56.250 --> 00:21:01.140
Jones, Edward R: So, because we're using stop frame the counters for rowan column start over again.

188
00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:12.810
Jones, Edward R: So the the the the column number and the room numbers are always relative to the frame that you're putting this thing on so since stock room is a new frame.

189
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:20.880
Jones, Edward R: We can have the book course as many columns as we like, we only have a single column of rope buttons or check buttons rather.

190
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:35.580
Jones, Edward R: And so it's just common one row one, and then the next check button will be rope to the next one, and after that road three and a deck about 13 or 14 of these check boxes that are one know, maybe, only seven.

191
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:45.990
Jones, Edward R: In this particular gui seven different stocks that go in there and so everything in here now is relative to this new frame.

192
00:21:49.740 --> 00:22:00.210
Jones, Edward R: And here we go if you look at the the function that is called when that first check button is clicked, which is the IBM check button.

193
00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:19.290
Jones, Edward R: When that's called, the first thing that happens is we make sure that all the buttons are cleared, that is, all the checks on various stocks are all cleared off they're all erased and then we set the one that was clicked, which in this case is IBM number one.

194
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:26.400
Jones, Edward R: And then we let's see symbol oh yeah so then we set the symbol.

195
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:38.610
Jones, Edward R: Here equaled IBM so that's that first entry square that would be let's see if I go back to the to the main.

196
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:48.000
Jones, Edward R: thing here, this is the symbol entry or up here so that that particular set statement is setting the symbol here.

197
00:22:48.750 --> 00:23:09.270
Jones, Edward R: which will appear as of all because we have a style associated with this entry box that has a larger font and the thought there is bold so that's what this set symbol is about putting the IBM letters in that box and then finally.

198
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:25.110
Jones, Edward R: This call start stack stock Stat rather What it does is it puts the stock prices in in this area of that second column, this is the second column on mainframe.

199
00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:34.830
Jones, Edward R: And so you have the entries there that are the previous close the current closing price all of that gets updated when you click on.

200
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:44.400
Jones, Edward R: In this case, if you click on the first one that would be IBM and they'll be clicked on the fourth one and people there, so all of these numbers get updated.

201
00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:56.640
Jones, Edward R: And inside of stock stuff there's a check to see whether or not one of these buttons is click and if it is then it updates the chart to for that particular stock.

202
00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:59.340
Jones, Edward R: And that's the way it works.

203
00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:13.050
Jones, Edward R: So if you want to you can download this stock I would the code rather and, of course, your could may already do this, in which case you don't really need my code, but.

204
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:21.540
Jones, Edward R: it's it should be doing it anywhere anytime i'll be i'll be looking at your uploads and your your submissions.

205
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:29.700
Jones, Edward R: And just checking to see that there's you've got all the features that we've talked about here, and if you did then, of course, you get 100.

206
00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:46.500
Jones, Edward R: And if you're lacking a few features, then you might get a number of small of them back of course hope everybody, as usual, turn in your assignment, even if it's an incorrect or incomplete, please trying to do, because that way you don't get the zero you get something that's not a secret.

207
00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:48.510
Karen Fireman: question now.

208
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.560
Jones, Edward R: Aaron.

209
00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.150
Karen Fireman: Okay here yeah.

210
00:24:51.660 --> 00:25:07.200
Karen Fireman: um I spent a lot of time trying to blank out the screen at the bottom when you clicked into the symbol I finally just put a picture of nothing in there, but is there a way to blank out the Madonna graph there when you click it you had asked us, you said when you click symbol.

211
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.010
Jones, Edward R: And you type in so the graph really absolutely.

212
00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:15.330
Karen Fireman: That because I did it a clergy way I didn't like the way I did it but.

213
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:16.650
Karen Fireman: The right way.

214
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:23.490
Jones, Edward R: Well, normally what you would do is just send a you have to say, there is a label.

215
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.440
Jones, Edward R: statement for that this option.

216
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:49.680
Jones, Edward R: Right and that statement, instead of having texts equal to something as the keyword image and then it's equal to, and it gives you and the image is set equal to the the actual P Li l file and I don't have I didn't mention this by.

217
00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.770
Jones, Edward R: let's see.

218
00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:54.990
Jones, Edward R: No.

219
00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:01.440
Karen Fireman: Thank you, and as a PNG and the example you gave us like Ts plot.

220
00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.540
Jones, Edward R: yeah yeah yes, yes.

221
00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.600
Jones, Edward R: hang on just a second i'm going to.

222
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:11.640
Jones, Edward R: i'm going to try to.

223
00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.130
Jones, Edward R: Exit full screen.

224
00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:32.910
Jones, Edward R: bring this down off of it for bed, and what I want to do now is, I want to bring down this Python solution to this computer is naked that there's some type of everything that should have and.

225
00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:37.890
Jones, Edward R: yeah.

226
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:42.030
Jones, Edward R: And then i'm going to open up.

227
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.400
Jones, Edward R: spy spider.

228
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:54.540
Jones, Edward R: By the way, if you haven't opened up spider go ahead and do so as well because we'll be we'll be looking at spider tonight.

229
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:04.470
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

230
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:14.880
Jones, Edward R: There it is.

231
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.820
Jones, Edward R: and

232
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:20.430
Jones, Edward R: OK.

233
00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:26.370
Jones, Edward R: Now i'm going to try to open up the.

234
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:29.610
Jones, Edward R: file that I just downloaded.

235
00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.380
Jones, Edward R: And I think it's in the downloads folder.

236
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.810
Jones, Edward R: There it is homework to you to open that up.

237
00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:50.190
Jones, Edward R: And of course the the tape is so small that I can't read it.

238
00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.710
Jones, Edward R: let's fix that can you read that here.

239
00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:01.470
Jones, Edward R: hope you can.

240
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:03.030
Jones, Edward R: All right.

241
00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:04.380
Jones, Edward R: Okay, good.

242
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:15.720
Jones, Edward R: What I wanted to show you was these import statements that are right below the T T kenter the tea kettle statements by now, I think you have a good feeling for what they're about.

243
00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:20.400
Jones, Edward R: The way we're always use and take interest those inputs that you see there.

244
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:31.620
Jones, Edward R: And the asterisk is this like Is there something we forgot that we might want to use so put an asterisk there and then the tk is for the kinder decanter.

245
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:45.990
Jones, Edward R: So you go TT K dot label says, use the label that comes from T kenter instead of the label widget that comes from tk, which is the predecessor to cheek enter.

246
00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:52.680
Jones, Edward R: And the next import that you see below have to do with the plot.

247
00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:59.160
Jones, Edward R: And so math plot here it's doing a great job for us to actually create that plot.

248
00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:15.720
Jones, Edward R: And when we save the plot from that plot live it's being saved as a file type P n G P amp G pop on November gamma I guess it is and golf and.

249
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:30.990
Jones, Edward R: So that's what math plot line is doing for us, the problem is that teak enter doesn't like a PNG file so and I say image equal to figure dot PNG it's going to croak on me T cantor's going to croak it doesn't like that.

250
00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:45.450
Jones, Edward R: So it wants the images to be formatted into a different format and that's the reason why we have this from a PL import image tk so P, p.

251
00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:58.830
Jones, Edward R: stands for Python image library, the Python image library actually has a method called image tk specifically for converting the images that are not.

252
00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:09.390
Jones, Edward R: In the format for tk and they just convert them into that format now a jpeg would have to be converted a PNG would have to be converted.

253
00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:20.190
Jones, Edward R: I think the only image that common image that might get through the net is she if I think if you have a G if you don't have to convert it, but all the other images have to be converted.

254
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:35.340
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so nowadays most of my images are php or jpeg so you have to convert them The good news is converting the image is relatively easy so if we go down through the code here.

255
00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:39.390
Jones, Edward R: And so i'm going to try to get down to.

256
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.680
Jones, Edward R: The area that you are asking about here.

257
00:30:47.760 --> 00:31:08.310
Jones, Edward R: let's see So here we go, so you could see for each stock the stock number one being IBM and and so forth, each stock basically we have the same calls, we have a call to clear everything now this stock clear what it does in the function is just above here.

258
00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:12.090
Jones, Edward R: Let me see if I can bring this up a little bit.

259
00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:17.310
Jones, Edward R: Oh gay not so good already.

260
00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.090
Jones, Edward R: On.

261
00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:42.600
Jones, Edward R: froze.

262
00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:05.640
Karen Fireman: We don't hear you.

263
00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:15.600
Jim Clark: yeah there must be a buffer and when he must be filling it up where.

264
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:17.010
Karen Fireman: that's a guess, I mean there's.

265
00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:18.930
Jim Clark: It can only tolerate so much.

266
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:41.550
6 Aldin Dollens Laptop: own fashion throttle.

267
00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:49.740
Karen Fireman: Problems he's having is related to the fact that we started definitely the six o'clock seven o'clock thing is it related.

268
00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:53.370
Clay Coleman: Now I don't know now.

269
00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:55.110
Karen Fireman: All right.

270
00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.760
6 Aldin Dollens Laptop: I would assume it's something to do in the building itself.

271
00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:09.930
Clay Coleman: Yes, it looks like they're looking at the potato Internet so.

272
00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:26.940
Jim Clark: It may be, in order to keep the left the the lecture flow and we might just asked him to turn this camera off except we really needs it to say stop video for his camera and just just lecture slides in the money.

273
00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:30.060
Karen Fireman: So that wouldn't be.

274
00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:31.500
Jim Clark: It conserves bandwidth.

275
00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.470
Karen Fireman: Every turn the video off good idea.

276
00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:41.610
Jim Clark: That was a story of my life copy the friends, you had to turn you couldn't turn video on because it would just it would it would crap out the system and France.

277
00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:47.250
Karen Fireman: And it's true for me, the first four semesters here totally changed from at amp T to comcast so.

278
00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:55.500
Jim Clark: If someone wants to try to Ping them say you know, maybe turn your video off unless you really need to show your face that may help with bandwidth.

279
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:57.060
Karen Fireman: On the chat.

280
00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.070
Jim Clark: yeah well.

281
00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:00.990
Jim Clark: I can.

282
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.610
Jim Clark: I can't do smoke signals.

283
00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:08.970
Clay Coleman: i'm sure they can hear us over the speakers were the other class video is.

284
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:18.300
6 Aldin Dollens Laptop: I do think I heard, I heard that extra credit if you send messages through interpretive dance, so you know feel free to do what you will, with that information.

285
00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.130
Hermano Ferreira: What are you drinking alden.

286
00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.860
6 Aldin Dollens Laptop: drinking, oh no.

287
00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:07.020
6 Aldin Dollens Laptop: To counter the wiling out any purchases does anyone have any stocks or bonds recently that they're very proud of that were modest reasonable and prudent purchases.

288
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:11.010
Wright, Elizabeth Harrison: can always invest in depth here, as you.

289
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:13.350
Karen Fireman: Go SCI there you go.

290
00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.880
6 Aldin Dollens Laptop: morbid but true.

291
00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:17.730
Karen Fireman: To say you're probably being winner this year.

292
00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:32.940
Jordan Gross: Does it count if it was through an employee stock purchase program because they gave me a great discount at the end of this six month period, it was.

293
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:38.490
6 Aldin Dollens Laptop: going to.

294
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:46.890
Jordan Gross: be prudent I invested in apple going up credibly great idea, every time I suggest it to everyone, I know.

295
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:47.760
You.

296
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.640
6 Aldin Dollens Laptop: know I would recommend to just about anyone I know that's true.

297
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:16.410
Karen Fireman: So anyway.

298
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:31.230
Karen Fireman: The problem I was having wasn't the PNG the problem I was having I mean I ended up putting a picture in there, that was blank but I was just wondering if anybody was able to zap graph like with some kind of function, or something.

299
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.660
6 Aldin Dollens Laptop: You object people's blank.

300
00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:40.080
Jim Clark: yeah that that's what that's what I did I can show you what I did you know if.

301
00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:43.830
Karen Fireman: You just tell me consumer if you grab a screen, we might never get it back to him.

302
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:44.940
Jim Clark: there's there's a.

303
00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:51.480
Jim Clark: it's like an opiate is one of our self.oh I actually got all my screen.

304
00:36:52.740 --> 00:37:07.140
Jim Clark: In the clear there's like an IMG oh big image object, and so, so what I did, which may or may not be right is I just put in under the stock Stat.

305
00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:15.120
Jim Clark: function I just said, if i'm gonna go get stats do self dot m obg.

306
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:17.640
Jim Clark: Right ego was not.

307
00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:19.230
Jim Clark: In it, it goes.

308
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:20.040
Karen Fireman: And that work.

309
00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:26.040
Karen Fireman: cool so you did that, after self that's close, but you didn't have to call anything.

310
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:37.740
Jim Clark: Well, no, because you, I have a function, I have a function down at the bottom that has for you, clearing out a lot of this we're clear entries I have.

311
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:41.910
Jim Clark: No, no it's not clear entry it's another spot.

312
00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.990
Jim Clark: it's under its under the point where you're putting in that this.

313
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:54.300
Jim Clark: This image this image file, you can find it.

314
00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:59.490
Jim Clark: Ever how we've got to take into the image file and save it and then you insert it in.

315
00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:03.090
Karen Fireman: yeah I remember that it's down there for ad or something and.

316
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.720
Karen Fireman: yeah yeah.

317
00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:12.240
Karen Fireman: Oh, you did self energy, I tried that self image equals quote coconut I couldn't get that to work.

318
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:15.330
Jim Clark: No, no, it equals none no Coco.

319
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.940
Karen Fireman: Coco didn't work for me.

320
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.390
Jim Clark: No, I just said, so the image.

321
00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:31.050
Karen Fireman: Do you do that, and then and then something else that make sure that it loads it in, because it seems like sometimes you need to do, said or get or One of those is that.

322
00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:36.210
Jim Clark: he's got his code i'm sure he's probably got something like that in there.

323
00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:48.870
Karen Fireman: Okay well that's all I was really asking because I ended up putting in an image that was blank I just took a picture of the screen and I made that a file and I, and I put that in that in there, if you know if I.

324
00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:53.040
Karen Fireman: like it, but it was it was not, it was a clue it wasn't a good answer.

325
00:38:53.850 --> 00:39:01.290
Jim Clark: No, I understand, so, but what what I got help advice and I did was I put in, you know.

326
00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.880
MS Analytics Class 2021: That should hopefully have enough.

327
00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.360
Jim Clark: Jesus is like 65 Watts or so.

328
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:08.160
MS Analytics Class 2021: yeah, this is not this is this is like okay.

329
00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.080
This is.

330
00:40:11.250 --> 00:40:12.930
MS Analytics Class 2021: just another word yeah.

331
00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:14.520
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

332
00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:46.530
Jones, Edward R: And what I want to do now is.

333
00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:56.850
Jones, Edward R: Look, I what I was going to do was just open up the homework problem homework number two is where I was at and.

334
00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:08.160
Jones, Edward R: So this is somewhere number two we were talking about the PL and some of the other things, and now, if I run this.

335
00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.140
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

336
00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:12.420
Jones, Edward R: Not that big.

337
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.590
Jones, Edward R: It up I run this.

338
00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.410
Jones, Edward R: should get.

339
00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:23.040
Jones, Edward R: There it is so here's the gooey.

340
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:32.190
Jones, Edward R: And it by typing sob s l the for silver and hit price.

341
00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:45.570
Jones, Edward R: said interesting, so the silver price actually dropped today, you know, there was some discussion about what was happening with silver and, if we look at the actual closing price coming up here.

342
00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:47.520
Jones, Edward R: and

343
00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.340
Jones, Edward R: What happened vertigo.

344
00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.620
Jones, Edward R: Python quit unexpectedly.

345
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.480
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

346
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:07.530
Jones, Edward R: not sure what have been there.

347
00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.890
Jones, Edward R: Try to launch it back bring it back up.

348
00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:29.430
Karen Fireman: So, Dr Jones would I thought you asked us to do is to be able to click this side click buttons you know the selected favorites and then, after having those sitting there with the closing price sitting down below in the graph.

349
00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:47.580
Karen Fireman: Then type in sov and see the graph below disappear, and then the, of course, the stats for sob show up that's That was a trick that I was kind of looking for I did a Cluj to show a blank screen, but I thought, maybe there was something better.

350
00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:48.660
Jones, Edward R: mm hmm.

351
00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:56.520
Jones, Edward R: Well, if you if you look at what's in this code that's I think that's where I got anyway we're so.

352
00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:58.650
Jones, Edward R: Here we go.

353
00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:05.250
Jones, Edward R: And you see if I can run this without Kevin.

354
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:08.310
Jones, Edward R: There we go so.

355
00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:09.840
Karen Fireman: If you click the side first.

356
00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:12.150
Jones, Edward R: sob.

357
00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:15.330
Jones, Edward R: or silver.

358
00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:21.180
Jones, Edward R: And then, if I asked for closing price let's see now.

359
00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:25.650
Jones, Edward R: It doesn't like it.

360
00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:28.980
Jones, Edward R: I don't know what's going on with that.

361
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:33.270
Jones, Edward R: So let's go ahead and move on from this.

362
00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:42.570
Jones, Edward R: And i'm going to bring backup or try to bring back up the the PowerPoint presentation here and talk about this.

363
00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.580
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so i'm going to go down to slide.

364
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:06.150
Jones, Edward R: up here.

365
00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:18.510
Jones, Edward R: i'm going to go down the slide number nine which talks about the Google goog le there's a male missing Google cloud, so what is Google cloud.

366
00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:36.120
Jones, Edward R: You some of you already probably know this, or if you don't you know about it and the Google cloud is a is a business within Google google's many businesses if you go to the URL shown here at the top, which is.

367
00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.830
Jones, Edward R: i'm going to turn on the slide show.

368
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:43.440
Jones, Edward R: Where i'm going to try to.

369
00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:48.000
Jones, Edward R: leave your current slide so a little bit larger there we go.

370
00:46:49.140 --> 00:47:00.090
Jones, Edward R: Well, this is a picture of one of the Google, one of the google's large farms for the cloud, which is a collection of computers, that a lot of districts and so forth, they use to store data and information.

371
00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:17.370
Jones, Edward R: So Google cloud is a collection of libraries that Google uses to build many of its solutions that you have, so the sun, the cloud in particular that we're going to be looking at is the clouds that they have or the libraries, they have for.

372
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:19.470
Jones, Edward R: Translating.

373
00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:21.360
Jones, Edward R: language.

374
00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:31.950
Jones, Edward R: Google cloud libraries are available for public use many are based on the state of the art Ai algorithms for search.

375
00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:48.510
Jones, Edward R: For languages for audio and provision analysis so you'll see in a moment here what that entails, these include some of the Ai tool to tools that we discussed and 656 like neural networks, for example.

376
00:47:49.500 --> 00:48:07.830
Jones, Edward R: And you might recall that in that course we talked a little bit about tensorflow and charisse in this course, about midway through the course we're going to talk a lot about tensor floor of flow and charisse and it's a major component in the Google cloud.

377
00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:22.110
Jones, Edward R: Here is kind of an overview of really big overview of what's in the cloud what's in the cloud, as I say, are a bunch of libraries.

378
00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:38.430
Jones, Edward R: And so, once you have one of the libraries, for example, is called compute engine and you can imagine what that involves basically machines that allow you to do computations that those machines are in the date of the day, their data Center the cloud.

379
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:45.960
Jones, Edward R: Then you have storage, that you can buy you know you can get that software development kit here.

380
00:48:46.920 --> 00:49:02.040
Jones, Edward R: sql is a type of live data library and so forth now most of what we're going to be talking about is in this part of the cloud will be here on the left, you see that it's labeled Ai artificial intelligence and machine learning.

381
00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:13.380
Jones, Edward R: So we're going to take a look at what what's involved in that part of the cloud and, in particular, there are three things in here that we're going to talk about.

382
00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:24.120
Jones, Edward R: On the far right hand side is a part of the cloud the cloud that's called translation and we're going to talk about that tonight.

383
00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:35.070
Jones, Edward R: But if you want to go beyond that you can try it translation, the the cloud translation takes the text and translated into other languages.

384
00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:46.650
Jones, Edward R: And it's more or less done and more or less done automatically, and I think, from what I could see is that Google has the edge on this translation business.

385
00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:53.970
Jones, Edward R: There are a lot of translation engines or you can go on and say translate Spanish for me they don't do a very good job.

386
00:49:54.720 --> 00:50:00.120
Jones, Edward R: And if you look at this what what Google is doing, you can see why that's happening.

387
00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:18.900
Jones, Edward R: Now they also have something that we may play with a little bit, which is taking taking speech audio recordings and putting that into text, so it by combining the speech to text with the cloud translation, you can build software.

388
00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:33.270
Jones, Edward R: get close to building software then we'll take a recording take a conversation and produce a text and a completely different language study the conversation maybe taking places Chinese.

389
00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:47.310
Jones, Edward R: And then you'll be able to translate it out into English by linking these two libraries together now the cloud translation from Chinese to English is is very, very good, from what I can see.

390
00:50:48.300 --> 00:51:02.640
Jones, Edward R: The cloud translation from Spanish to English is OK, I understand, but the the the actual translation is somebody said something to me like this, they said.

391
00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:13.740
Jones, Edward R: You speak Spanish Okay, I understand what you're saying, but that's not how we say it, and so the problem is grammar the grammar is is a little bit off.

392
00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:23.250
Jones, Edward R: In the in the version of Spanish translation that we're looking at now they have some other things here they have video Ai.

393
00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:34.380
Jones, Edward R: Video of you know classifying video according to what it is they can actually look at a video and tell you what what the objects are in that video that's the idea behind that.

394
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:44.580
Jones, Edward R: There is a natural language cloud, which is sentiment analysis and classification of text, we talked about doing this and 656 years in SAS.

395
00:51:44.970 --> 00:51:53.610
Jones, Edward R: And also using Python so they have a bit it'll be here, it will be interesting, we don't have time to do this, but it would be interesting to look at and compare.

396
00:51:54.030 --> 00:52:03.930
Jones, Edward R: This Google cloud natural language translation against the other types of software that's a bit of all that we talked about at 636.

397
00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:13.020
Jones, Edward R: Now some of you may be looking for projects here, you know for this class and I don't expect you to do something huge right.

398
00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:24.480
Jones, Edward R: Something that's reasonable reasonably done in a small relatively small amount of time and investigating some of these parts of the cloud could be a good project for this class.

399
00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:36.840
Jones, Edward R: So, for example, you could explore this part the cloud natural language and look at and compare sentiment analysis here with sentiment analysis, the way we did it in.

400
00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:48.720
Jones, Edward R: or classification of the text, you know, identifying what are they talking about what other topics that's classification of text that's also available here.

401
00:52:54.030 --> 00:53:11.190
Jones, Edward R: Now let's talk about how you get into the class, this is, this is the ugly part google's a large business, and so they have a huge marketing machine designed to encourage corporations to use the cloud.

402
00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:18.750
Jones, Edward R: And in order to get access to the cloud software, you have to have a developer account.

403
00:53:19.770 --> 00:53:27.600
Jones, Edward R: And the way you do, that has changed over the years for security reasons and also for just ease of use.

404
00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:39.720
Jones, Edward R: And this is true, with Twitter and Facebook and, as you saw with alpha vantage they all have a special way you develop an account that, then you get an API key.

405
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:50.310
Jones, Edward R: or some other file or something like that which then gives you access to the software that they say is free right.

406
00:53:51.180 --> 00:54:01.470
Jones, Edward R: There, a cloud software is tree on a limit on but it's basically on a limited basis right so for what we're going to do in class it's this free.

407
00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:11.400
Jones, Edward R: But if you were doing this commercially let's suppose you drew you develop an hour that now you want to sell that and you want people to be able to use to translate.

408
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:24.870
Jones, Edward R: conversations or some sort and you're going to use the cloud, well then you're going to be paying a fee, which is relative to how many Apps you sell and what they people are doing with them, and so forth.

409
00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:37.440
Jones, Edward R: So how do you do well, if you need to in order to get a well I have something up here be aware of Google marketing students can avoid the big g.

410
00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:49.950
Jones, Edward R: If you once you jump into this little part of their of their of their website you're going to get some heavy handed marketing from Google like you need this yeah it cures world hunger.

411
00:54:50.970 --> 00:55:00.330
Jones, Edward R: You ever you know sign up tell us all about your corporation, and the thousands of people they're going to use the software right that's what they're geared up to do.

412
00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:18.210
Jones, Edward R: And they have sold that to a large a lot of large corporations to software corporations right, so they Google said tells them that look you, you are developing the software and you need you need language translation, or you need image recognition or voice recognition, we got it.

413
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:28.560
Jones, Edward R: no need for you to reinvent that but you know it's not going to be that expensive, this is the marketing machine so when you get into this part of the of the.

414
00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:38.910
Jones, Edward R: web page of the web, the area that we're going to look at just be aware that they're going to try to get you to click on something.

415
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:57.990
Jones, Edward R: That will take you to someplace in the cloud where really it's the big corporations that they're trying to fish they're trying to walk here and not you, you know somebody just trying to learn this so you go to this webpage and I think the webpage here is.

416
00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:10.710
Jones, Edward R: cloud.google.com cloud.google.com and if you go to that web page you'll get a button that says guy get started for free.

417
00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:15.510
Jones, Edward R: And you want that's the one you want to click on Now let me go.

418
00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:23.640
Jones, Edward R: jump out of here just for a second and go over to the safari.

419
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:26.370
Jones, Edward R: and

420
00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:36.750
Jones, Edward R: You know Okay, what are you doing now safari see I don't use safari, so this is one of the reasons I it.

421
00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:44.160
Jones, Edward R: Okay it's up here yeah all right there you are okay so i'm going to go to Google and i'm sorry.

422
00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:46.710
Jones, Edward R: cloud dot Google.

423
00:56:48.330 --> 00:56:50.490
Jones, Edward R: Why is that, in the way.

424
00:56:57.390 --> 00:56:57.780
yeah.

425
00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:03.720
Jones, Edward R: Forget safari let me go back to the chrome.

426
00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:13.980
Jones, Edward R: here.

427
00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:17.040
Jones, Edward R: And i'm going to do cloud.

428
00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:22.350
Jones, Edward R: That google.com.

429
00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:28.350
Jones, Edward R: Okay, here it comes all right, so of course you have this.

430
00:57:29.490 --> 00:57:35.820
Jones, Edward R: Nice picture of their cloud and now i'm going to extend this and go.

431
00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:39.270
Jones, Edward R: I will i'm going to go Google.

432
00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:43.590
Jones, Edward R: cloud.

433
00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:45.420
Jones, Edward R: cloud.

434
00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:53.250
Jones, Edward R: That google.com forward slash.

435
00:57:57.090 --> 00:57:57.660
Jones, Edward R: Free.

436
00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:00.180
Jones, Edward R: Forward slash.

437
00:58:01.740 --> 00:58:03.810
Jones, Edward R: So it's google.com free.

438
00:58:04.830 --> 00:58:08.940
Jones, Edward R: cloud.google.com slash free slash.

439
00:58:10.590 --> 00:58:20.340

440
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:37.980
Jones, Edward R: Okay $300 three credit really okay yeah so they're going to they're going to want to charge you if you end up if you try to use the cloud for commercial uses large commercial uses this is one of the ways that are going to they're going to make any money.

441
00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:53.370
Jones, Edward R: Now, on yours, it probably does not say go to console it probably says something like go to free use or something like that it says go to console if you already have a developer account.

442
00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:58.980
Jones, Edward R: If you already have a developer account in the cloud, which they see me.

443
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:03.180
Jones, Edward R: And they say wait a minute you already have one so go to the console.

444
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:09.960
Jones, Edward R: Well Jamie, what is your say this you're saying go to console or go to what good of.

Karen Fireman: Like hearing your system for free.

00:59:20.070 --> 00:59:24.630
Jones, Edward R: yeah okay so most of most of you, I expect you're going to get a.

449
00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:37.410
Jones, Edward R: Blue button that says go here for something free at you want to click on that, and you want to sign up then for So if I go over here, where you see my little picture over there, that was taken years ago.

450
00:59:38.610 --> 00:59:40.530
Jones, Edward R: Sign out of all accounts boom.

451
00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:44.100
Jones, Edward R: Really boy.

452
00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:46.380
Jones, Edward R: cancel.

453
00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:50.700
Jones, Edward R: I didn't mean to do that okay.

454
00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:57.120
Jones, Edward R: So yeah.

455
00:59:58.230 --> 01:00:01.170
Jones, Edward R: So let me go back to cloud.

456
01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:06.990
Jones, Edward R: That google.com slash.

457
01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.090
Jones, Edward R: Free.

458
01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:12.930
Jones, Edward R: Now, then I should get to the funky button.

459
01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:25.200
Jones, Edward R: get started for free that's the button, I was looking for right there, so if you're not already in if you don't already have a developer account it's going to say get started for free, they lie.

460
01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:36.630
Jones, Edward R: Right and then it says hey go go watch you sign in one of these others, I think you and i'm not going to do that because.

461
01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:49.950
Jones, Edward R: Well i'm trying to imitate what you're going to see and you're not going to us it's going to want you to sign into a Google account if you have that that would be a gmail account.

462
01:00:52.590 --> 01:01:00.690
Jones, Edward R: But, at any rate, you take it takes you through this whole process of signing up and then they'll you have to give them your information.

463
01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:08.460
Jones, Edward R: Your personal information about your address, and you know who you are and that kind of thing your company name if you.

464
01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:21.870
Jones, Edward R: just leave that open or just put on Texas a&m or something like that, and then it finally gets to the back end of this thing and it says well okay we're going to give you a delta developer account, but we need your credit card.

465
01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:34.740
Jones, Edward R: So Google, why do you want my credit card, they say, well, we want to make sure that you're a real person and not a robot yeah Okay, there are ways to do that without taking my credit card.

466
01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:43.170
Jones, Edward R: The real reason for the credit card is that they're going to give you basically an allowance and it says.

467
01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:54.210
Jones, Edward R: There, in the case of translation, they give you an allowance of half of the million characters per month, if you use this translation engine.

468
01:01:54.720 --> 01:02:01.860
Jones, Edward R: And you do not translate more than a half a million characters per month, they won't charge your card, that is true.

469
01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:11.160
Jones, Edward R: But if you should translate more than a half a million characters and, by the way, a small book is more than a half a million characters.

470
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:19.320
Jones, Edward R: or a little video might be more than half a million characters then you're going to get a charge on your car.

471
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:29.400
Jones, Edward R: Now what I what i've decided to do here is, I want to encourage you to go ahead and get your own developer account.

472
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:49.830
Jones, Edward R: And so I have a couple of slides here that talk about this and there's the URL google.com and it is free right, so I would like you to to do your best to get your account set up, and I think it's fairly.

473
01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:54.900
Jones, Edward R: Self explanatory they tell you what's going on.

474
01:02:57.990 --> 01:03:00.030
Jones, Edward R: The only note that I would say is.

475
01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:08.430
Jones, Edward R: Be just be aware they're they're a little bit you know, like I know we don't really need your credit card, but we're going to be please give it to us anyway yeah.

476
01:03:09.810 --> 01:03:23.790
Jones, Edward R: I think this is fairly secure, and so I have given them my personal email address and credit card in order to get the credentials that I need in order to access the cloud.

477
01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:31.140
Jones, Edward R: If you decide that you don't really want to do this that's your a little bit on easy about this whole thing.

478
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:45.480
Jones, Edward R: You can use my credential and i'm going to provide them to you here tonight on the website only thing I ask is don't do too many characters okay don't translate the Bible, please don't.

479
01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:54.690
Jones, Edward R: Take the Bible and translated in Chinese or something no don't do that, by the way, you can do that it is possible, but.

480
01:03:55.230 --> 01:04:00.630
Jones, Edward R: let's not do that let's keep it down to 2000 3000 at most a translations.

481
01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:10.260
Jones, Edward R: If you get your own credentials, you can you can translate up to 500,000 characters per month and then after that.

482
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:22.860
Jones, Edward R: They charge you a few dollars per million characters it's really not that much and so people are using the cloud to develop Apps that they can then sell to other people.

483
01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:32.400
Jones, Edward R: And they can credit from they can make money off of that and then, of course, they pay a certain fee to Google to be able to do that.

484
01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:43.110
Jones, Edward R: So I think it would be good if you go through and set up your own account, but if you don't want to go through all that trouble now okay don't worry about it.

485
01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:51.960
Jones, Edward R: Well, I got your back on that, but the setting up the account gives you a better idea of what's happening inside Google, the way they price things.

486
01:04:52.830 --> 01:05:06.600
Jones, Edward R: And the way they talk about things, and they they're going to talk about it in the context of Oh, you must be with Chevron or you must be with IBM or some large corporation and we're going to make some money with this don't worry about it.

487
01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:08.820
Jones, Edward R: Okay, they all do that.

488
01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:19.110
Jones, Edward R: Now, Google organizes their accounting by your projects and so when you're setting up your account.

489
01:05:19.590 --> 01:05:31.410
Jones, Edward R: The next thing they're going to ask for is what is the name of your project now, you can have more than one project, I would suggest you just tell them is tm six or one for general generic project name.

490
01:05:32.490 --> 01:05:41.400
Jones, Edward R: And then within that project, you can you have to give them a credit card for that project and then within that what they will do.

491
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:52.860
Jones, Edward R: Is they will allow you to attach the tools that you need for this thing is funky okay so they're going to let you attach.

492
01:05:53.610 --> 01:06:02.430
Jones, Edward R: The cloud the cloud translate library so that's the that's the library, we want it's called cloud translate.

493
01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:11.100
Jones, Edward R: that's the way they refer to it that's the library we're going to be using and what happens then is they send you a little text file.

494
01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:19.830
Jones, Edward R: that's not too large it's maybe 200 to 300 characters and they call this their credential your credential file.

495
01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:28.410
Jones, Edward R: And now, in the past they used in different form of authentication in the end they're closed out the use of the co op.

496
01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:41.400
Jones, Edward R: Which is a common form of security that us with Twitter and Facebook and some other you know other places that distributed sell data basically and.

497
01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:53.520
Jones, Edward R: So all of these folks you notice with alpha vantage we had to give them an API key and then they took that API key and then gave you access to their data.

498
01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:03.750
Jones, Edward R: So these companies are also doing the same sort of thing they're selling data over the Internet or in the case of Google they're actually selling software algorithms.

499
01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:12.480
Jones, Edward R: snippets small libraries for use general use that in your APP or your your company whatever you're going to do with it.

500
01:07:13.050 --> 01:07:21.360
Jones, Edward R: And then, what they're going to do is they're going to have some kind of the now we're talking dollars here unless you're IBM, and you have this huge number.

501
01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:40.170
Jones, Edward R: Actually, if they if you get charged a lot of money, it probably means you're making a lot of money because that's that's where the the big numbers come in, if you distributed an APP and that APP gets sold to thousands of people and they use it for translation you're going to get built.

502
01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:48.120
Jones, Edward R: But the good news is if in that situation, you should be making good money on that distribution.

503
01:07:50.940 --> 01:08:02.940
Jones, Edward R: So you can build your own Apps and you can sell or use them commercially or you can turn them into this class fast your class project okay.

504
01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:11.580
Jones, Edward R: So this is one of those areas where you might be able to form up a class project around one of these Apps.

505
01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:27.210
Jones, Edward R: And the APP that we're going to be looking at here in just a moment for the homework is, if you took it and you moved it up to a slightly higher level that would be a class project, so this will be to show you what i'm talking about.

506
01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:39.990
Jones, Edward R: registering and in creating your own account with Google is a form of authentication that's how they know who you are, and when you run your software or your APP whatever it is.

507
01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:50.670
Jones, Edward R: They know who did it, and if you do too much of it you're going to get a bill, and they all work that way with that advantage, we had an API key.

508
01:08:51.210 --> 01:09:01.380
Jones, Edward R: They were nice enough really nice to say okay you're all students you're in a class and so forth, and so on, so have at it.

509
01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:19.530
Jones, Edward R: and get distributed this key, by the way, it's going to die at the end of the Semester somewhere around there so they're not completely exposed, but other people instead of an API key, they will have something called an old Och P, which is similar very similar to the API key.

510
01:09:20.730 --> 01:09:30.120
Jones, Edward R: What what what our vantage is calling the API key it's just a long list of alphanumeric characters that you have to give this.

511
01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:45.720
Jones, Edward R: In a handshake in your software so in our software, we had to have an API key and we had to send that API key to alpha vintage before we could ask for any time series data or any stock prices or anything like that.

512
01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:54.480
Jones, Edward R: But once we shook their hand and gave them the API key they knew who we are then they're happy to give us the data, because we ever held is set up.

513
01:09:55.710 --> 01:10:03.720
Jones, Edward R: Now, if you we were commercial they will be tracking how often how much data we download and they would be charging this money.

514
01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:10.950
Jones, Edward R: But I don't know I talked to the right people or something got lucky and they just said okay you're good.

515
01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:16.740
Jones, Edward R: They maybe they have like a an avid aggies I don't know.

516
01:10:19.290 --> 01:10:26.910
Jones, Edward R: who uses something totally different the Google cloud is not is as actually I liked her so that approach, better.

517
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:39.210
Jones, Edward R: If you use an API key that API key is visible in the code so anybody who gets access to that code can see that API key, then they can you serve it and.

518
01:10:39.660 --> 01:10:54.120
Jones, Edward R: Basically use it for their own purposes, and meanwhile you're paying the bill, or whoever owns the key right so like any other thing like identity theft, if that happens you're probably going to have to a column about can you key please.

519
01:10:55.470 --> 01:11:01.140
Jones, Edward R: Okay, more security, more security you're going to hear that well what the credentials file it's different.

520
01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:12.510
Jones, Edward R: You still have this information and it's the credentials file is unique to your profile and your credit card your credit card is not in this file, by the way.

521
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:21.390
Jones, Edward R: what's in the file or some special project now there is a special number that identifies your project and some others descriptors that are in there.

522
01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:30.570
Jones, Edward R: But the nice thing about this is that you have to send them a bio but you don't have to put the file inside the code it's not indigo.

523
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:48.150
Jones, Edward R: You put it in a separate file the code reads that file when it executes and then sends them that information so if somebody should give access your code unless they have that file it won't work so.

524
01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:54.360
Jones, Edward R: For all everything by keeping that file protected, you can encrypt the file and.

525
01:11:55.170 --> 01:12:12.420
Jones, Edward R: Computer encrypted so that nobody can use it unless they know how to encrypt that file, though I think it's a better way to to to handle this problem of people hijacking API keys and getting a free access to David they're trying to sell.

526
01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:22.020
Jones, Edward R: Okay here's the APP this is your assignment for this week and i'm going to show you a little bit about what's going on here, this is fun.

527
01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:32.970
Jones, Edward R: Okay, this is the Google translate is really amazing in most respects and let me tell you why it's amazing.

528
01:12:33.930 --> 01:12:48.990
Jones, Edward R: Typical translation will be a word for word or a couple word translation right, so you got Spanish here and they see I blah and then Okay, that means to speak, or to you know say something.

529
01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:58.530
Jones, Edward R: And they they just go to the dictionary and say Okay, here it is put the word in a you know one Spanish word one English word like that one for one.

530
01:12:59.010 --> 01:13:10.350
Jones, Edward R: horrible translation it's hilarious when they do that you can imagine what happens there and then, when you get to other languages, where.

531
01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:18.900
Jones, Edward R: there's even a larger difference in the structure, the language it gets the be even worse, so what google's done.

532
01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:26.250
Jones, Edward R: Is they are using a machine learning technique now so when we had 656 you've learned about.

533
01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:38.160
Jones, Edward R: analyzing natural language it's by looking at the structure of the language and that helps you to then identify the topics that are being discussed in the conversation.

534
01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:51.870
Jones, Edward R: Well, what Google is doing is they have taken the same sort of approach that you use a natural language analysis and now applied it to translation so.

535
01:13:52.290 --> 01:14:05.550
Jones, Edward R: that they have a large software they call ml auto ml and what that does is machine learning so instead of just doing a word for word translation.

536
01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:11.940
Jones, Edward R: they're looking at the entire context of what's being talked about, and then using that to do the translation.

537
01:14:12.690 --> 01:14:19.500
Jones, Edward R: So, this would be this would most likely involve a very large and heavy neural network that.

538
01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:32.130
Jones, Edward R: allows us probably created using something like tensorflow and charisse so they built this huge network, specifically for translating certain languages right.

539
01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:42.180
Jones, Edward R: So Spanish is, you know that they need to work on a little bit more the some of the grammar is funny, but it is really.

540
01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:54.570
Jones, Edward R: quite good compared to what the word for word translation model used to how that used to work and i'll show you some some examples of that.

541
01:14:55.320 --> 01:15:05.550
Jones, Edward R: Now Chinese I don't know Chinese, but I did translation, so I went to the Chinese website copy the characters which are beautiful but I don't understand them.

542
01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:19.380
Jones, Edward R: But through the translation engine Oh, my goodness, it looks to me like a perfect translation so somebody really worked hard on the Chinese neural network that makes that translation.

543
01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:37.080
Jones, Edward R: And in fact for most of these languages like I did some I know German a little bit, so I did some German things to see whether they would catch it or not, the German translation is excellent, you know, and then the Italian and the Latin translations they even have Zulu.

544
01:15:38.670 --> 01:15:46.470
Jones, Edward R: The land and they have Navajo translations, if you want to translate something into the Navajo very, very cool.

545
01:15:47.310 --> 01:16:01.500
Jones, Edward R: And not only that, but you do not have to tell Google this translate software, what is the language you're talking about so you can give them, for example, a Spanish.

546
01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:19.620
Jones, Edward R: And the Google will figure out Oh, this is Spanish so they then they use the Spanish translator and they produce the output can be any other language, English, it could be Italian what have you, and so the the identification of the incoming language is automatic in this system.

547
01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:26.070
Jones, Edward R: And now you can specify what that is, but in this APP it's automatic.

548
01:16:27.090 --> 01:16:34.440
Jones, Edward R: Because the incoming language is pretty clean, you know if you have a mixture of languages on the incoming file, you may have a problem.

549
01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:43.620
Jones, Edward R: But if it's just all Spanish or all Chinese or what have you does an excellent job of recognizing what the native languages that's coming into the system.

550
01:16:44.520 --> 01:17:02.790
Jones, Edward R: The target language is the transaction that translation language, and you can see, in this particular APP I distressed store describing here they set a target languages that I was sort of interested in, so I know a little bit of Spanish little bit of German, so I was curious about that.

551
01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:14.520
Jones, Edward R: And then, of course, I was coming from South Africa visiting there I know Afrikaans and zoo little bit, believe it or not, similar was probably the number one language and South Africa.

552
01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:25.260
Jones, Edward R: And then Chinese I thought well Chinese and they really translate Chinese yes very, very well, so this APP the way it works is.

553
01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:39.240
Jones, Edward R: You can type something in various like if you have just a sentence or two or word and you want to translate that up here says short translation, you can just type it in right up here and then you click this button that says translate.

554
01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:56.880
Jones, Edward R: And then, when you get through, you can click clear and it will clear out that whatever it is such a if you type down up there, the translation will appear in the upper windows spider so it'll come over beautiful watch over the output window spider that shows up over there.

555
01:17:57.900 --> 01:17:59.310
Jones, Edward R: Now, if you have a longer.

556
01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:10.890
Jones, Edward R: text like a whole file of it, you can click on this button that says text file and then what it will do is it allows you to browse.

557
01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:21.750
Jones, Edward R: Where that file is located, and they will open that file and then translate it once again it doesn't matter what the language is in the incoming file.

558
01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:35.520
Jones, Edward R: What it does is it looks at whatever you want, as the output, the translation on the right hand side, so, by default, that is English so that opens up a Chinese file it's coming back as English but.

559
01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:43.170
Jones, Edward R: You could take a Chinese file and produce Afrikaans or Arabic or person or what have you whatever you want it there.

560
01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:55.950
Jones, Edward R: Now, once once the translation also appears in the spider output window, but if you want to you can click on the SAVE button here, and it will save the translation to another file.

561
01:18:56.490 --> 01:19:07.890
Jones, Edward R: And the SAVE button or similar to the text file button allows you to browse and just save it wherever you would like and it's going to be saved as a standard text file.

562
01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:15.030
Jones, Edward R: Because of the encoding of the languages and in Chinese in particular use a certain coding.

563
01:19:16.590 --> 01:19:26.550
Jones, Edward R: Now these buttons are all working right now, so your homework assignments well this button on the right hand side that says save.

564
01:19:27.150 --> 01:19:35.160
Jones, Edward R: It doesn't work right now, so your homework assignment is to make it work, that means you have to go in and an extra figure out who's doing what.

565
01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:47.430
Jones, Edward R: And then save the translated document to translate a document into a file using the file what's called a file dot dialogue in T kenter.

566
01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:59.340
Jones, Edward R: There is a file open and about closed dialogue inside of the character which allows you to create a button that says save and then it'll pop up and say Okay, where do you want me to save it.

567
01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:10.860
Jones, Edward R: What director, do you want me to go into what you want me to call it, so you have that that kind of thing, and it is, it is done differently in windows and Max.

568
01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:20.850
Jones, Edward R: It uses the internal software on those systems to make this happen in a natural way for the user right now the audio button.

569
01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:36.090
Jones, Edward R: And the website button are not working, you are free to do it now, this would be a good project is to flesh out this sort of thing, maybe add to it a little bit of, for example, the audio button here, you could use the cloud.

570
01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:50.760
Jones, Edward R: Recording to text feature so there's a part of the cloud you saw that earlier, it says okay this particular library, you can speak into the microphone and produce text.

571
01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:55.770
Jones, Edward R: Now, how well the second work that he told no.

572
01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:07.980
Jones, Edward R: You better have a good microphone you better not have much background noise, but the what you can do is, you should this out your button is you could allow people to.

573
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:22.140
Jones, Edward R: create a recording save it to a file and then send it over for translation I think that's the cleanest way to do it if you try to do it real time theoretically that's possible but.

574
01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:35.730
Jones, Edward R: I tried it a few times and wasn't very happy with it, this one on the far left html reader give me a well and website location and I will go and pull all the texts out of that and translate it.

575
01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:44.940
Jones, Edward R: That means, you have to strip the html before you do the translation, there are many ways to do that, there is the request function.

576
01:21:45.810 --> 01:21:54.570
Jones, Edward R: Request library and Python that will allow you to that allows you to read html and and push it out as a straight text file.

577
01:21:55.230 --> 01:22:03.540
Jones, Edward R: So that the button on the left, could be handled that way, but right now the only button that really is working is this one called text, while.

578
01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:14.370
Jones, Edward R: And you click on it, and it will allow you then to open up a text file and your homework assignment is to create insert the Code into this APP.

579
01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:36.120
Jones, Edward R: That allows you to save the translation Okay, also in your homework assignment you're being asked to expand the list of natural languages that you see here I want you to do that and I give you a list of what those languages are, I think it's let's see Korean.

580
01:22:38.670 --> 01:22:44.550
Jones, Edward R: yeah, so this is saying, basically, you need to make this save button work and now it's not working.

581
01:22:45.570 --> 01:22:49.380
Jones, Edward R: And then you want to add Japanese Korean of enemies enemies and lab.

582
01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:55.830
Jones, Edward R: Latin is kind of interesting because it's not the same as attacking.

583
01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:07.350
Jones, Edward R: Back in the day, by the way, when I was a kid Latin was the most common language that people study in college or in high school.

584
01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:19.680
Jones, Edward R: The idea, there was a Latin as the basis for all the romantic languages, French, Spanish and Italian and if you know Latin, then you can come to get along in French and Spanish and Italian.

585
01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:29.400
Jones, Edward R: I don't believe that, but it is the root of all those languages, and of course there's quite a bit of Latin me in English as well.

586
01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:40.440
Jones, Edward R: Now please in testing out what you're you're working everything i'm going to give you some some test files and i'd like you to use those.

587
01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:52.590
Jones, Edward R: But if you want to try something different than that's fine keep it down to about 2000 characters if you're using my credit card if you're using your credit card go for it, you know.

588
01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:56.490
Jones, Edward R: it's not that expensive, but if you want to.

589
01:23:58.170 --> 01:24:00.360
Jones, Edward R: Do a book go to.

590
01:24:01.410 --> 01:24:12.600
Jones, Edward R: Gutenberg gutenberg.org I think it is that so there's a website where you can download books and texts large books there's thousands of them, and you can find them in different languages.

591
01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:23.850
Jones, Edward R: But once you're done upload your Code and the APP that is a screenshot of it running and also the test cases and their English translations.

592
01:24:25.230 --> 01:24:32.520
Jones, Edward R: Please let me know also when you're submit your homework, whether you're using my credentials file or your own credentials file.

593
01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:46.650
Jones, Edward R: If you're using your own mind rather i'd like you to explain why what it what it What was it about creating your own credentials file that kept you from going there.

594
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:54.810
Jones, Edward R: I need to know what this is the first time i've tried to teach this sort of thing in class because because of the need for.

595
01:24:55.320 --> 01:25:08.700
Jones, Edward R: credit cards, and all that sort of thing, and you know you're you're working with a large corporation, and it is painful some time, so I hope this goes well, but it's going to be a learning experience for me.

596
01:25:10.260 --> 01:25:12.120
Jones, Edward R: Now let's get back to.

597
01:25:13.620 --> 01:25:32.520
Jones, Edward R: Reading go back to Python here and I have the template okay now if you go to the week three folder right here, and if you clicked on the the folder that says week three lecture files open it up okay.

598
01:25:33.570 --> 01:25:37.410
Jones, Edward R: I have some test files here, I have two files that are in Chinese.

599
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:42.810
Jones, Edward R: These are articles about presidency and the Chinese navy.

600
01:25:44.370 --> 01:26:03.570
Jones, Edward R: which they say is second only to the United States in terms of its size and I believe that, although I think the French the British and some of the to Europeans may take exception to China sorry the Russians probably would take exception to that that comment.

601
01:26:05.610 --> 01:26:28.650
Jones, Edward R: And then I have some Spanish things, of all things Sinhala which is Sinhala is just well they're right there adjacent to the sea of Cortez so you have Baja California, that you have similar right there on the other side and said alone produces most of the probably most of the agriculture.

602
01:26:29.850 --> 01:26:40.290
Jones, Edward R: That that they sell from Mexico to the that states, you know the mangoes the tomatoes, the avocados they're coming most of those are coming at us in the lower.

603
01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:52.140
Jones, Edward R: Well, it turns out that the women who live up in the mountains, the set of the day they think that they grow some coffee and said, well, I sent a close kind of tropical but hey so is.

604
01:26:53.220 --> 01:27:00.240
Jones, Edward R: You know, Guatemala, Costa Rica those places so there's a little article here about the women in similar growing coffee.

605
01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:09.210
Jones, Edward R: And I was, I thought that was kind of an interesting thing another was when next time I go back to their i'm going to come to go up there, to the weather growing this and.

606
01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:14.340
Jones, Edward R: actually talk to them and find out what does that whether they're having any fun we're not now.

607
01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:35.160
Jones, Edward R: Then there is a baseball series called a group series and Muslim and that's also in Spanish, so these files, you can use these as test cases, so you can open, you can have the APP read the Chinese file and then produce the English or produce the French or whatever you want to do.

608
01:27:36.210 --> 01:27:57.270
Jones, Edward R: And then, this is this is this file this says translate template you see that one that's the that's the Python code that will produce the the basics for that that template that you saw.

609
01:27:58.290 --> 01:28:01.500
Jones, Edward R: Now y'all need to expand that in your homework assignment.

610
01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:10.410
Jones, Edward R: Then there is my credentials right down here and i'm going to open this up for download right now make available boom right there should be.

611
01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:22.620
Jones, Edward R: shouldn't be okay right now there, it says, Google translate credentials, those are my credit card credentials Okay, so if you are successful in getting your own credentials and I hope you do.

612
01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:28.770
Jones, Edward R: get your own you can use this Okay, and certainly you could use this to develop the.

613
01:28:29.550 --> 01:28:38.640
Jones, Edward R: For the homework assignments, you know to do them in order to test the modifications you're going to have to do that now let's go back over to let me go back over to spider here.

614
01:28:39.330 --> 01:28:52.410
Jones, Edward R: ups, before I do that I need to download I need to download the template right so i'm going to click on that guy it's coming rundown and I also need to download.

615
01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:54.690
Jones, Edward R: and

616
01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:02.970
Jones, Edward R: I need to download the json file right here.

617
01:29:04.050 --> 01:29:10.440
Jones, Edward R: that's the credentials and we would go down there, they are Oh, this will that make a lot of sense to you.

618
01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:22.050
Jones, Edward R: You see what I mean, and this is the see that thing that says began private key you see that says private key look at that thing okay.

619
01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:32.490
Jones, Edward R: I don't know how they generated that but yeah nobody's going to be copying that unless they copy the entire file, by the way you when you you'll see in the code.

620
01:29:32.850 --> 01:29:41.580
Jones, Edward R: But the code does is it actually has to read this file and send the whole thing over to Google and then Google says okay you're good to go.

621
01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:54.900
Jones, Edward R: We got your credit card, and fortunately you'll look in here and you'll see there's nothing in here about me credit card or anything like that they so these numbers are.

622
01:29:56.670 --> 01:30:02.250
Jones, Edward R: used by Google to identify me, but nothing in here would help anybody do that.

623
01:30:04.350 --> 01:30:05.370
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so.

624
01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:15.450
Jones, Edward R: i'm going to go over here into into Google, I mean i'm spider rather i'm going to close down the the program hw to.

625
01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:24.810
Jones, Edward R: And i'm going to then open I hope this wouldn't work on this computer it worked on the other, computer open.

626
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:33.630
Jones, Edward R: And I think it's the download area that is that was put no he didn't go there, oh.

627
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:37.500
Where did it go.

628
01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.450
Jones, Edward R: wow Let me try the desktop.

629
01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:51.420
Jones, Edward R: I don't see it there.

630
01:30:53.070 --> 01:30:56.580
Jones, Edward R: Let me go back, let me go back and do another download about.

631
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:03.690
Jones, Edward R: Maybe I did the.

632
01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:07.890
Jones, Edward R: Professor at the processor yeah it says keep or discard right.

633
01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:10.800
Jones, Edward R: So I have to say, keep.

634
01:31:12.330 --> 01:31:16.800
Jones, Edward R: All right, then, that came down and this thing I don't think.

635
01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:20.310
Jones, Edward R: let's see file.

636
01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.790
Jones, Edward R: Save page.

637
01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:30.930
Jones, Edward R: downloads credentials Jason yeah mm hmm.

638
01:31:32.490 --> 01:31:33.540
Jones, Edward R: yeah we did that.

639
01:31:35.670 --> 01:31:37.920
Jones, Edward R: yeah I forget that the this.

640
01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:42.570
Jones, Edward R: spider doesn't want to open up files.

641
01:31:44.130 --> 01:31:57.420
Jones, Edward R: Unless you say yes please do that so Okay, let me go back to downloads again, it should be there now there it is okay good, so we have the translate template now it has number one on ones I don't like that okay.

642
01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:10.170
Jones, Edward R: We may have to rename this it, it also has will translate Google translate credentials that that's important so i'm going to open up this guy right here.

643
01:32:11.670 --> 01:32:13.920
Jones, Edward R: I don't think Python will choke on that one.

644
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:24.210
Jones, Edward R: Get command requires the command line developer tools could, would you like to install these tools, no I don't know i'm not doing any getting.

645
01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:29.160
Jones, Edward R: Alright, so let me make this larger.

646
01:32:34.890 --> 01:32:35.820
Jones, Edward R: You can see.

647
01:32:36.990 --> 01:32:42.660
Jones, Edward R: There is some you'll see the code is very familiar looking you see the import statements there.

648
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:58.590
Jones, Edward R: You see, the PL no I don't have the PA we're not doing grip plotting map lot live here, but we will see some new statements here google.org dot U Th authenticate.

649
01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:13.710
Jones, Edward R: And then from Google cloud import translate underscore be to as translate and then import storage Google cloud storage So those are the parts of the cloud that we're getting access to.

650
01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:33.360
Jones, Edward R: And you see when the translate gooey is called, of course, the the canvas G when is pushed over to the gooey but look at this instead of API key we're pushing over that file credentials.

651
01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:41.640
Jones, Edward R: And you can see right here, it says self credentials equal credentials we're storing that off.

652
01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:43.200
Jones, Edward R: and

653
01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:47.520
Jones, Edward R: will be using that later now all of this business.

654
01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:57.120
Jones, Edward R: should be fairly familiar with you, you know the the entry, there are some entry boxes, or some buttons and labels and things like that.

655
01:33:57.690 --> 01:34:10.740
Jones, Edward R: And a whole bunch of stuff here the languages that are coming in there and here's some checkboxes let's let's crack Let me try to crank this up keep your fingers crossed all right let's see what happens.

656
01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:18.180
Jones, Edward R: And birchard occurred while starting the Colonel I don't like that.

657
01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:20.190
Jones, Edward R: over here.

658
01:34:23.970 --> 01:34:24.720
Jones, Edward R: yay.

659
01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:34.380
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

660
01:34:39.570 --> 01:34:45.780
Jones, Edward R: I don't think it actually started, so we we try run this file again.

661
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:55.680
Karen Fireman: it's saying that the project fall is the credentials file is that what we mean.

662
01:34:57.900 --> 01:34:58.110
Karen Fireman: On.

663
01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:06.240
Line 321 2323.

664
01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:07.890
Jones, Edward R: yeah.

665
01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:11.880
Jones, Edward R: The credentials contain all that information, the.

666
01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:15.570
Karen Fireman: name of the project file or that's the name of the credentials file.

667
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:21.060
Jones, Edward R: The name of the credentials file is Google translate credentials.

668
01:35:21.390 --> 01:35:25.200
Karen Fireman: Case it's calling that the project file is that what we'd want to call the project.

669
01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:30.240
Jones, Edward R: yeah You see, I just named that you give it any name, you want.

670
01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:33.360
Jones, Edward R: Google Project file.

671
01:35:34.410 --> 01:35:34.800
Karen Fireman: Okay.

672
01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:37.530
Jones, Edward R: You can you can give that anything you want right.

673
01:35:43.230 --> 01:35:54.210
Jones, Edward R: So you just loading you're saying okay this file is going to be called Google Project file and then you say load credentials from file and then you use the same name, right here.

674
01:35:54.210 --> 01:35:55.530
Karen Fireman: Oh, I see Okay, thank you.

675
01:35:55.620 --> 01:36:01.110
Jones, Edward R: yeah you could call it, you could call it P file or API file and then use.

676
01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:02.730
Jones, Edward R: The same name over here.

677
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:14.550
Jones, Edward R: Okay, but this is this little APP Google dot art, which was in that import statement has a method called load credentials from file and so that's what we're doing there.

678
01:36:15.450 --> 01:36:26.580
Jones, Edward R: You sending that over to the cloud and Google is then he's basically authenticating looking at the at the file and you will get an error message if there's something wrong with that file.

679
01:36:26.970 --> 01:36:36.000
Jones, Edward R: All right, if Google doesn't like that file you're going to get an error message from Google, which basically says no, no we're not gonna let you in.

680
01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:38.100
Jones, Edward R: That sort of thing.

681
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:40.410
Jones, Edward R: Now.

682
01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:44.040
Jones, Edward R: Where is the APP.

683
01:36:47.970 --> 01:36:48.750
Jones, Edward R: That running.

684
01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:50.940
Jones, Edward R: I don't see it running.

685
01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:55.320
Karen Fireman: My country doesn't seem like why couldn't.

686
01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:56.850
Jones, Edward R: We.

687
01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:05.220
Jones, Edward R: get this, you have a poi country thing you can take that out it's not being used, it was something that I was experimenting with.

688
01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:10.620
Jones, Edward R: So okay.

689
01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:14.040
Jones, Edward R: We try that again.

690
01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:15.870
Karen Fireman: Google cloud either.

691
01:37:18.930 --> 01:37:20.940
Karen Fireman: Oh, do we have to do content install.

692
01:37:24.150 --> 01:37:24.780
Jones, Edward R: Okay let's.

693
01:37:25.980 --> 01:37:30.240
Jones, Edward R: see if I get it oh run there's a run thing run.

694
01:37:33.090 --> 01:37:40.050
Karen Fireman: Do we need Google an installation of Google cloud because seems to not have it.

695
01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:44.010
Jones, Edward R: it's not running for some reason.

696
01:37:46.170 --> 01:37:46.710
Jones, Edward R: and

697
01:37:47.850 --> 01:37:51.930
Jones, Edward R: Let me try this console restart Colonel.

698
01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:55.740
Jones, Edward R: yeah yes.

699
01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:04.050
Jones, Edward R: It says, an error occurred while starting the Colonel again that's looking a little more normal.

700
01:38:05.730 --> 01:38:07.140
Jones, Edward R: Now let me try that run.

701
01:38:08.430 --> 01:38:09.630
Jones, Edward R: And it should that again.

702
01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:23.580
Jordan Gross: Professor and, I believe, if i'm not mistaken earlier when it asked about the get connection, I think it needed that to be able to install some of the packages to interface but i've run into that issue before.

703
01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:26.160
Jordan Gross: We IP colonel, especially so.

704
01:38:26.250 --> 01:38:30.930
Jones, Edward R: i've never seen i've never seen that i've never seen that but I suspect you're right it's just.

705
01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:42.960
Jones, Edward R: I need to I need to update this this computer on museum I haven't used in some time and so it's basically I think what is seen as you need to update this computer, that is, the Python part of it.

706
01:38:43.890 --> 01:38:51.900
Jones, Edward R: And so I will I will do that and then tomorrow night we will get into this a little more more carefully.

707
01:38:52.410 --> 01:39:02.730
Karen Fireman: And we can we ask a question, though, because I, I tried on my screen to to do what you just did, and it said no module name Google cloud when I tried to run it.

708
01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:04.500
Jones, Edward R: It says what.

709
01:39:04.830 --> 01:39:07.740
Karen Fireman: No module named Google cloud and I.

710
01:39:08.190 --> 01:39:12.240
Jordan Gross: Can yeah You can check the chat there's a solution to that in that.

711
01:39:12.510 --> 01:39:12.990
Sorry.

712
01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:15.900
Jones, Edward R: What is the solution.

713
01:39:17.250 --> 01:39:20.550
Jordan Gross: Just to pip install the Google cloud.

714
01:39:22.050 --> 01:39:24.090
Jones, Edward R: Oh yeah yeah.

715
01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:26.280
Jones, Edward R: yeah you need to.

716
01:39:27.390 --> 01:39:34.200
Jones, Edward R: that's right i'm glad you mentioned that Oh, my goodness, this thing here called Google Google cloud, you need to install.

717
01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:38.580
Jones, Edward R: And that's why that is why i'm getting.

718
01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:40.860
Jordan Gross: Like copy and pasted kindles comment.

719
01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:46.560
Jordan Gross: I was just mentioning to Karen that I pasted candles comment again.

720
01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:49.050
Jones, Edward R: yeah actually I think you can just say kinda.

721
01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:53.100
Jones, Edward R: Read over here on this side part, you can see kinda.

722
01:39:54.210 --> 01:39:54.960
Jones, Edward R: install.

723
01:39:58.530 --> 01:39:59.010
Jones, Edward R: Google.

724
01:40:00.330 --> 01:40:00.810
Jones, Edward R: cloud.

725
01:40:05.250 --> 01:40:06.240
Jones, Edward R: I believe.

726
01:40:08.670 --> 01:40:18.300
Jones, Edward R: That you saw you that's what that's that's why it's not getting off the ground is because I am this particular machine I didn't install I don't think I installed the Google plug.

727
01:40:19.770 --> 01:40:36.060
Karen Fireman: It just like that it says some new module name Okay, then it says when I tried that content store Google cloud and it said, you may need to restart the on all but it also says package not found Google cloud.

728
01:40:37.230 --> 01:40:43.260
Karen Fireman: And then, it says current channels and it's got a bunch of channels repo a condo.com packages.

729
01:40:43.710 --> 01:40:52.170
Clay Coleman: Karen if you if you look at the it's not Google cloud it's Google dash cloud dash translate there if you look at chat oh.

730
01:40:53.490 --> 01:40:53.940
Karen Fireman: Sorry.

731
01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:56.790
Jones, Edward R: well.

732
01:40:58.590 --> 01:41:01.560
Karen Fireman: it's found there, I was looking at the earlier one okay thanks.

733
01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:04.800
Jim Clark: install it is okay.

734
01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:07.620
Jones, Edward R: yeah the install should work.

735
01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:10.620
Jones, Edward R: kinda install Google cloud.

736
01:41:12.630 --> 01:41:14.040
Jones, Edward R: And it's it's a.

737
01:41:15.090 --> 01:41:17.730
Jones, Edward R: It takes a while it's just collecting package metadata.

738
01:41:19.050 --> 01:41:20.550
Jones, Edward R: This is a large package.

739
01:41:24.210 --> 01:41:27.030
Jones, Edward R: Oh, it did say yeah I said no, I didn't like it.

740
01:41:28.770 --> 01:41:29.280
Jones, Edward R: Oh.

741
01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:41.850
Zuberi, Bilal Mustafa: So, reading the Google documentation, they say, Google cloud packages deprecate it instead of that they have individual packages for each module that you want to use so, for example, if.

742
01:41:41.850 --> 01:41:49.170
Jones, Edward R: You know, translate I don't know I worked it I did this on my home computer and didn't have this problem right, I think.

743
01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:51.180
Zuberi, Bilal Mustafa: You can install individual package I.

744
01:41:51.180 --> 01:41:53.700
Jones, Edward R: Think, I think a bunch I don't think you have to do that.

745
01:41:55.290 --> 01:41:58.200
Jones, Edward R: And it works, you should be able to install Google cloud.

746
01:41:59.550 --> 01:42:02.550
Jones, Edward R: And I think I think i'm amelia used to tip.

747
01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:09.210
Jones, Edward R: don't remember having his breath.

748
01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:12.660
Jones, Edward R: I don't remember a lot of things see there it goes.

749
01:42:13.890 --> 01:42:15.720
Jones, Edward R: So if you use pip.

750
01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:25.770
Jones, Edward R: restart Colonel.

751
01:42:36.210 --> 01:42:36.870
Jones, Edward R: So.

752
01:42:37.950 --> 01:42:49.710
Jones, Edward R: we're running out of time here i'm going to go ahead and just let you let everybody i'm sorry for the problems tonight i'll try to make it up to you, tomorrow, and I will make it up a little better and going forward.

753
01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:54.750
Jones, Edward R: will do a reboot reboot on this whole arrangement and see whether we can.

754
01:42:56.220 --> 01:43:07.290
Jones, Edward R: You know the idea behind this arrangement was that we would get better audio and video better video, but then we have problems with this, and I think the problem here is I didn't I didn't.

755
01:43:08.490 --> 01:43:21.510
Jones, Edward R: Really thoroughly check out this computer before coming up here, I thought it was I thought I forgot the stuff was not installed on here so i'll need to make sure that that's in the future that is different.

756
01:43:22.710 --> 01:43:24.120
Jones, Edward R: I think we're we're all right.

757
01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:29.430
Jim Clark: But that just thanks for for for trying to make the system work, I really appreciate the effort.

758
01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:31.080
Swanson J, Charles Richard: Yes, thank you very much.

759
01:43:31.590 --> 01:43:32.310
Jones, Edward R: yeah I think.

760
01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:39.720
Jones, Edward R: Once we get through this I think you're going to enjoy this because the the translate thing is is kind of fun and.

761
01:43:40.290 --> 01:43:45.630
Jones, Edward R: There are other things that we can do in the glue Google is there is an area called Google Apps.

762
01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:57.000
Jones, Edward R: As well as Google cloud so Google cloud gives us access to things like tensorflow and cares it gives us the ability to recognize images and voice and text and things like that.

763
01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:04.200
Jones, Edward R: And there's something called Google Apps and you probably have are if you've gone on Google and said, give me directions.

764
01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:13.680
Jones, Edward R: Give me directions to someplace that's Google Apps and you can get access to the things like the direction.

765
01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:23.580
Jones, Edward R: The navigator they call it Google navigator and there's some other Apps as well, and there are some features in those Apps that are time from time to time use.

766
01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:31.110
Jones, Edward R: And one of the features, for example, as you can give it two locations and they'll tell you the distance between those two locations.

767
01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:42.870
Jones, Edward R: And that's kind of nice if you get data and you say well this I have data here, where the person, it was born here where they live here, and I would like to know how far that is.

768
01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:55.560
Jones, Edward R: Well, you can use Google Apps to automatically fill in that data right it's fairly easy to do so, and the access to the Apps and the cloud are the same you basically have a.

769
01:44:56.370 --> 01:45:16.020
Jones, Edward R: file a credential file and then with that you can run that that the code so tool so tomorrow night okay well i'll try to do better and we'll we'll have this working for sure tomorrow night for sure okay i'll see you then.

770
01:45:17.010 --> 01:45:17.610
Jim Clark: Yes, Sir, thank you.

771
01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:18.390
Swanson J, Charles Richard: Thank you.

772
01:45:18.450 --> 01:45:19.170
Zuberi, Bilal Mustafa: Thank you, Professor.

773
01:45:19.530 --> 01:45:19.830
Wilson Pineda: Thank you.

774
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:22.320
Jones, Edward R: yeah I wish I had another monitor I could.

775
01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:23.250
Jones, Edward R: See everybody.
