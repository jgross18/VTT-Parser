1
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.930
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, Karen. Karen, can you hear me.

2
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.300
Karen Fireman: Yes, sir. How are you

3
00:03:51.420 --> 00:04:00.720
Capstone Coach 1: Oh, I'm doing well. I was just a little worried that maybe people didn't have the meeting number. Where did you find the media numbers in your calendar or

4
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:13.410
Karen Fireman: I found it in the this the left hand side of your, of your part of our a campus website and I put it in there in the morning. This morning and tried it, but I agree with you there certainly are, and

5
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.400
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so it should be on a campus somewhere. Right. Yeah.

6
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.630
Karen Fireman: Yeah, it is on the left side where it says like office hours. Oh, Wilson, how are you

7
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.150
Karen Fireman: Hello Wilson.

8
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.830
Wilson Pineda: Carrie. Hi, how are you very

9
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.400
Karen Fireman: Good.

10
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.430
Wilson Pineda: Hey clay. I look at yours.

11
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.780
Capstone Coach 1: Hey, are you doing

12
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.640
Capstone Coach 1: Oh, it's sort of nice to see people

13
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.650
Karen Fireman: Oh, it's great to see you. It's

14
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.780
Capstone Coach 1: The, you know, the classroom setup is is foreign. You know they're there were no cloud. There were no students in the classroom.

15
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.390
Not I, actually.

16
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.860
Wilson Pineda: I said, some people thinking about it.

17
00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:05.130
Wilson Pineda: We kind of, I think, I cannot pay bye bye everyone. But are there were some comments that people prefer session we do in your house with the better off than the office.

18
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.250
Karen Fireman: Yeah, I saw, I heard that also

19
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:23.070
Capstone Coach 1: I i think all because I have better control over my voice. You know the volume. And also, I can hear what you're saying. These earphones or noise cancelling, you know, they're really good boys. Most are

20
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:32.940
Capstone Coach 1: So I can hear it, the mica the actually the speaker in the classroom sounded like there was something wrong with it. There was a reverb. I mean, was just

21
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.500
Capstone Coach 1: Sounded it sounded like it was broken. I couldn't make out what people were saying

22
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:49.860
Capstone Coach 1: And and then the computer setup is who knows hit a hole. It's a foreign computer I don't normally use that computer so

23
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:58.020
Capstone Coach 1: How things are working on a computer, whether it code will work on that computer or not is always well maybe it will, and maybe it won't

24
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:06.390
Capstone Coach 1: Last night I was lucky because I was doing some new things and that I hadn't had time to really test out on that computer

25
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:17.310
Capstone Coach 1: Unfortunately, nothing you know everything seemed to work fine. But there were several little gotchas in there that you know if the internet connection, for example, was not sufficient.

26
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.530
Capstone Coach 1: Those little

27
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.800
Capstone Coach 1: goodies that go out and grab information off the that would not work right.

28
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.840
Capstone Coach 1: So, so I'm looking at I'm looking at the campus now and

29
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:32.940
Capstone Coach 1: Maybe

30
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.410
Capstone Coach 1: So it's on the I'm looking at the left hand side and

31
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.970
Karen Fireman: It had it.

32
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.460
Capstone Coach 1: Zoom information is that up.

33
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.780
Karen Fireman: With. See, I think, I think that might have been it. I think that might be

34
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.260
Capstone Coach 1: Looking under I clicked on zoom information.

35
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.890
Capstone Coach 1: And there's a link for the class.

36
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.360
Karen Fireman: Yeah, it was in the

37
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.520
Karen Fireman: Sea for a second here. One second.

38
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:05.940
Capstone Coach 1: Oh, zoom for students. There's a zoom for student

39
00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.100
Karen Fireman: No, that's No that's not it, that's the

40
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.900
Satyam Gupta: Q AMP a session is called this

41
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.540
Karen Fireman: Q AMP. A it's the Q AMP a session that port.

42
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.480
Capstone Coach 1: Au okay and that's

43
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:17.100
Karen Fireman: That's this

44
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.090
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah, there it is. I see video recording

45
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.040
Capstone Coach 1: But it's so it's under the recording. You know, it's not there.

46
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:32.910
Karen Fireman: No, the in the second box there. It's an extra last one, q AMP. A sessions. It's got your zoom right here.

47
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:38.310
Capstone Coach 1: Well,

48
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:48.720
Karen Fireman: I think it's just really close to seven o'clock people haven't. I don't know about you, but for me, and time really creeped up on me. I was like, oh my god, two minutes.

49
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:51.990
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah.

50
00:07:53.220 --> 00:08:10.500
Capstone Coach 1: So how do you feel about seven o'clock and said, I'd say six o'clock. I don't have a preference, but I was thinking, some people work or of course, nowadays with the with the virus thing. People are going to drive into work right. So maybe that is not everyone's driving to work.

51
00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:12.480
Capstone Coach 1: Some people are

52
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.480
Capstone Coach 1: So it's seven o'clock okay for everyone or should we think about changing this next week.

53
00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:34.110
Jim Clark: I'm okay. The way I'm actually taking a another class I line has that had class, but it's only for the next two weeks. So, you know, I'll work with whatever the students have I'm just

54
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:34.950
Capstone Coach 1: You know,

55
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.980
Jim Clark: My List of the conversation. I don't have a specific question asked

56
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:48.960
Capstone Coach 1: Right, I will similarly for having too many questions, but I thought what we would do is go over that little homework assignment. Sure. Anybody else have any comments about the starting time

57
00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.350
Amanda Pham: When I was starting time now.

58
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.360
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, yeah.

59
00:08:54.390 --> 00:09:04.110
Satyam Gupta: Seven is fine. I mean, if you want to push back. Bring it in. We want to make it earlier. I think six Toby's the better but six, I would not be

60
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.490
Capstone Coach 1: Okay well unless there's no big objections will stay with the seven o'clock.

61
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.850
Capstone Coach 1: Mayra wants to talk to me tomorrow, so I don't know what's gonna come out of that conversation.

62
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.530
Amanda Pham: Are you in trouble. Dr. Jones.

63
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:21.510
Capstone Coach 1: I could be, you know, I don't know. No, I didn't. Nowadays I don't know what's going on.

64
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.780
Amanda Pham: You sound like a troublemaker.

65
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.090
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah, let's yeah and

66
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.860
Jim Clark: Maybe, maybe you're gonna get a race.

67
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.050
Capstone Coach 1: Right.

68
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:39.810
Capstone Coach 1: I think, I think the university is doing good. This really good considering everything they got to deal with.

69
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:49.020
Capstone Coach 1: Although things are strange and others. I got I got requests to take classes from university that I don't work at

70
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.950
Capstone Coach 1: Things like that. It's a little odd.

71
00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:09.630
Capstone Coach 1: But at any rate, I'm glad to this vaccine coming out. The only. That's the good news. The bad news is, nobody seems to be getting it except a few people who just happened to run into somebody with a needle in Sydney as anybody gotten the vaccine in this group.

72
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.510
Shadi Kilani: I did, I got the first dose.

73
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:14.880
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah.

74
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.360
Shadi Kilani: That was two weeks ago. A week ago.

75
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.490
Capstone Coach 1: We yeah

76
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.710
Capstone Coach 1: She managed to get it.

77
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:24.390
Shadi Kilani: Connections.

78
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.400
Capstone Coach 1: That's that's

79
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.730
Capstone Coach 1: That's exactly what I'm

80
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:30.180
Capstone Coach 1: Saying

81
00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:31.380
Jim Clark: Is dark, dark

82
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:38.130
Shadi Kilani: Night. I know I it was like amended by my primary care physician and I'm with a little group.

83
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.850
Shadi Kilani: Yeah, so then really, it's a well oiled machine and you know

84
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.550
Capstone Coach 1: My sister. This is a story that I'm giving you know

85
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:51.420
Capstone Coach 1: This is a story that I'm getting is people from people is that they just have

86
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:53.370
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

87
00:10:53.970 --> 00:11:05.070
Jim Clark: Well, I'm, you know, I'll say, I'm on the one v list. And so I've got two different lottery systems that are supposed to let me know when when I can make an appointment. So I said, Okay.

88
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:23.370
Shadi Kilani: I'll share this for the benefit. Number one, I didn't have any major of side effects. The only thing I had was sore shoulder for four days and I got really tired and sleepy. On the first day. Like, I went to bed at like seven

89
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:31.980
Shadi Kilani: And woke up at like eight or something in the morning seven or eight and then the second day, it was still shoulder sore, but

90
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:43.590
Shadi Kilani: Everything else was fine. I wasn't and then by the third day, it's like I didn't do anything. And it was it was it was a positive experience. I know a lot of people are concerned about the side effects and

91
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:50.460
Shadi Kilani: They observed me for like 15 minutes it's in the thing for allergic reaction and

92
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.420
Capstone Coach 1: My wife got the she's got the vaccine last October.

93
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:56.400
Jim Clark: Oh, good. Okay, good.

94
00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:01.050
Capstone Coach 1: Oui oui oui volunteered for the Pfizer trial and the more gunner during a trial.

95
00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:13.680
Capstone Coach 1: You know, you can go online, you volunteer for us. So we went down and volunteer for it and they loved her man 6065 or 65 and Hispanic. Oh my god, they couldn't wait to give her a shot.

96
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:23.130
Capstone Coach 1: But in my case they deliberated about a month and decided no we're not going to give it to your and you're really in too high of a risk group.

97
00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:34.830
Capstone Coach 1: So, but the good news is, my wife had it. So she's got antibodies and she's my major exposure. Anyway, so that was the death is make sure that she's

98
00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:39.030
Capstone Coach 1: A carrier because she goes to the gym every day at least once a day.

99
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:49.290
Capstone Coach 1: And then she goes shopping and all kinds of things. And she hates to wear the mask so she in Mexico. We were in Mexico over the holidays.

100
00:12:49.950 --> 00:13:00.090
Capstone Coach 1: And they're pretty strict down there about the mass, they actually have security at the gate or the door of every store that will stop people if you don't have a mask on. So she

101
00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:09.360
Capstone Coach 1: She tries to walk into the grocery store with a face shield, which is her favorite thing if they feel that way. She doesn't put on a mask. Like I wouldn't let her in.

102
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:27.480
Capstone Coach 1: And I I shook my finger editor. And as I told you so wear the mask so but she went down the street and bought a mask, but it was a kid's mask would have like a ninja turtle on it or something is really funny. I told her it looks better.

103
00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:41.640
Capstone Coach 1: Well, anyway, so we went to Mexico for a little over two weeks and the routine down there with the virus is a little different, but it seems like they're doing better. I could be the weather. I don't know.

104
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:49.680
Capstone Coach 1: It could also maybe be that they just have a general resistance stuff that we don't have, I don't know, but

105
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.270
Capstone Coach 1: I was really surprised we didn't catch anything good.

106
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.600
Capstone Coach 1: Good good good experience actually had a good time.

107
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:13.230
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, well let's go ahead and get started as five after seven. I think it's just the PROBABLY THE ATTENDANCE TONIGHT. And with the session is being recorded and so it will go online, probably later tonight.

108
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:26.880
Capstone Coach 1: If are there as well, you know, typical questions about the course or about the assignment or anything like that that we want to talk about before we get to the homework assignment.

109
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:32.400
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

110
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.920
Jim Clark: I guess I don't, other than it

111
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:49.830
Jim Clark: Just, I guess I'm going to need to start scheduling more time to to absorb tonight's lecture before had any intelligent questions mean I've worked on some but not not after but not that you're really hitting walls just

112
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:55.050
Capstone Coach 1: Know it's really unfair thing because we just had the class last night and I don't know about you, but I was

113
00:14:55.230 --> 00:15:00.480
Capstone Coach 1: Well, I was up late last night to drive back. And so I slept in this morning.

114
00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:11.880
Capstone Coach 1: Evan have a long time so I don't expect a lot of good, but I was thinking maybe there was something about the syllabus or grading or anything like that, that people won't want to talk about

115
00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:15.420
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

116
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:22.260
Capstone Coach 1: All right, well, let's get, let's get on with the we're talking about the homework. What I really wanted to talk about tonight was the

117
00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:35.820
Capstone Coach 1: The homework, especially the assignment that the first part of their like three or four things on for their on their and the very last item is there. I mean I wouldn't hoping the one thing that you're supposed to turn in is a

118
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:44.040
Capstone Coach 1: Some code to do it develop a gooey and really all you need to do is to morph

119
00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:52.200
Capstone Coach 1: Two things. Well, there's two things. One is, you're asked to generate a gooey. When you click on the go and you put in the

120
00:15:52.710 --> 00:16:01.800
Capstone Coach 1: You put in a symbol for a stock like IBM and then you click on the GUI, and then it comes back and tells you what the price of the stock is right now.

121
00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:19.410
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, I went through today. I took some extra time and went through and looked at the website. And let me show you. I'm going to, I'm going to grab your screen here are just going to shut me down and share my screen with you.

122
00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:23.550
Capstone Coach 1: Share screen.

123
00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.270
Capstone Coach 1: And yeah, I think it's number one.

124
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:30.810
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

125
00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.980
Jim Clark: Yeah, now it's coming up now.

126
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:43.380
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, if you could see that, I suppose. Yeah, no problem. Alright, so first of all let me

127
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.210
Capstone Coach 1: Move this over. This is the campus right

128
00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.490
Capstone Coach 1: So on the campus. If we go into our week one folder.

129
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:02.190
Capstone Coach 1: That good

130
00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.960
Capstone Coach 1: Well, there it is. Okay, week one.

131
00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:16.920
Capstone Coach 1: And I'm going to try to organize things the way we did last summer. And so we'll have a separate folder for every week. And inside that folder.

132
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:28.800
Capstone Coach 1: You'll have the material we using then the lecture, period. You'll also have the assignment and then the upload for the assignment. And so it's the same kind of drill where

133
00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:36.690
Capstone Coach 1: Basically you, you know, you look at the assignment and it tells you in here, what you shouldn't be uploading this number five.

134
00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:43.920
Capstone Coach 1: And so I'm expecting a really small upload because this is the start. I mean, the code for this is very small.

135
00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:58.710
Capstone Coach 1: And so you'll have like maybe one page of code Python code and then the next page will be a screenshot of the of the app on your show it running on your computer when it first starts up

136
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:07.890
Capstone Coach 1: And then a second screenshot shot showing what the app looks like when you actually run it using IBM or

137
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:24.600
Capstone Coach 1: Some other stock. In fact, I should probably give you this some stocks to look at and IBM, of course, is the one that uses the demo for the API key. So that's in here, but you could run it using another stock as well.

138
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:32.640
Capstone Coach 1: I don't know if any of you've had a chance to to get the your personal API code.

139
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:44.460
Capstone Coach 1: It's not necessary. You can use my code. But if you want to do some things on your own. You might want to actually take this homework.

140
00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:54.810
Capstone Coach 1: And morph it into a semester project. I think you could do that. I was thinking about that tonight about some things that you could do as a semester project.

141
00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:06.600
Capstone Coach 1: Using this approach. You could, for example, you could create a gooey that will actually plot the stock price over a period of time, right.

142
00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:20.910
Capstone Coach 1: And that would be that would be acceptable as a semester project and maybe you would be looking at some particular stock or stocks and your presentation would be how you did that, and then

143
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:35.400
Capstone Coach 1: Maybe a discussion of what you see the what's you see happening in the stock market and things like that. So, and then there are other types of things that you can do. Let me pull over to a another web page.

144
00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:49.680
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, this is the web page for alpha vantage. These are the folks that are giving us the stock prices and the exchange rates for stock and things like that.

145
00:19:50.460 --> 00:20:12.570
Capstone Coach 1: And their URL. I think we get at this in class is alpha Vantage one word alpha Vantage dot CEO, not the city not Colm, by the way. I think that's kind of interesting. They seem to be Rob running out of Boston, but dot CEO is unusual.

146
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:18.990
Capstone Coach 1: Domain for this sort of thing, usually be a.com or something like that.

147
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:31.050
Capstone Coach 1: At any rate, they seem to be nice for people, they, they have been communicating with me on email and they're the ones that said, Oh, well, we took you because you're ready, education, and am there's something about a nama like

148
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:52.350
Capstone Coach 1: That anyway. They said, well, we'll make that that you let your students use it. And by the way, it's going to have an unlimited use tags to it till the end of this year, and normally they, you know, they actually sell you in order to use get an API.

149
00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.420
Capstone Coach 1: Key that has unlimited use, you have to pay money.

150
00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:10.200
Capstone Coach 1: Because there are people that are taking advantage of this and they are, what they're doing is they're creating apps and websites where you can go and get information. And that's when information right

151
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:26.520
Capstone Coach 1: So that's, that's something that people sell. And so I was a little surprised that they will give it to us for free actually unlimited. That's pretty cool. But be careful about your distribution. Don't show your code or send anything to anybody outside of class.

152
00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:37.020
Capstone Coach 1: Because I mean people commercially or otherwise could could get that key and take advantage of the system pieces situation.

153
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:42.180
Capstone Coach 1: Now let's take a look at the documentation that's the for us. That's the

154
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:51.570
Capstone Coach 1: Place that we want to start. So let's go to the documentation here and I really like the way they've organized. They've organized things according to

155
00:21:51.870 --> 00:22:12.570
Capstone Coach 1: The type of data that you would be getting. So at the top is stock time series. And so you can kind of guess what this is. This is a set price information for individual stocks over periods of time and you have options here to go week daily a weekly, monthly

156
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:24.060
Capstone Coach 1: And Justin and non adjust and they have no new they have actual data that you can get if you're interested in doing research and a longer period of time.

157
00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:39.300
Capstone Coach 1: Number two, they have fundamental data, which is the information about companies these companies, I think, are may or may not be listed on the stock exchange. But what you have here is the income statements.

158
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:48.450
Capstone Coach 1: Balance sheets cash flow and so forth and so on earnings calendar IPO calendar and things like that.

159
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:55.890
Capstone Coach 1: That's kind of it useful investment information the IPO calendar. For example, a lot of people

160
00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:10.380
Capstone Coach 1: Specialize in purchasing IPOs. Now that's the initial purchase offer and these are companies that are just becoming listed on the stock exchange and they they purchased them with the expectation that they're going to go up.

161
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:20.700
Capstone Coach 1: So that it's a good company that's coming on the exchange. They think that maybe the off the initial price is below what it will ultimately settle at after about 30 days or so.

162
00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:31.170
Capstone Coach 1: So this is one way to people look at us an opportunity to make a lot of money, of course, like anything on the stock market. You could also lose a lot of money.

163
00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:42.660
Capstone Coach 1: Some companies after they are IPO their stock price goes down in value and then we have FX for for currency exchange.

164
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:51.120
Capstone Coach 1: And this is what I was using to get the current exchange rate for the Japanese yen and pesos and things like that.

165
00:23:51.630 --> 00:24:00.510
Capstone Coach 1: And we pretty much went over this set, you click on this guy right here. And I think this is the one that shows you what's happening with the end right now.

166
00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:10.980
Capstone Coach 1: And so the end of what the end you can get the information using the API key of demo. You don't need to have a key.

167
00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:26.340
Capstone Coach 1: So it looks it shows you the relationship between the US dollar. In the end, which is about one penny one yen is one penny right now. And this is as of right now. Actually, no, it's it's January.

168
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:34.050
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah, January 21 I mean later well. Oh, I see. This is probably maybe this is the time in Japan.

169
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:36.840
Capstone Coach 1: Certainly not the time here.

170
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.160
Clay Coleman: At UTC time

171
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:50.730
Capstone Coach 1: UTC time. Okay, so it's it's tomorrow already UTC, I guess. Yeah. Okay. And the bid price and the asking price right sell and buy

172
00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:57.210
Capstone Coach 1: So you have the exchange rates here. I think that's kind of cool.

173
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.610
Capstone Coach 1: Let's see. Okay.

174
00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:10.740
Capstone Coach 1: Going back here to the information that you have. Now if you're interested in crypto currencies. A lot of people trade in crypto currencies, or they

175
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:20.550
Capstone Coach 1: They buy them with expectation and they're going up right bitcoins right now they they're there. If you look at the history for bitcoins lately, it's living really outrageous.

176
00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:32.400
Capstone Coach 1: I don't know how many 10s of thousands of dollars each coin is worth now but at one time they were they were, but he was saying on $6,000 are going. That's crazy. But now it's like way above

177
00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:41.670
Capstone Coach 1: People make money with that. And this is really cool. I think a lot of people will tell you this very

178
00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:51.210
Capstone Coach 1: risky because of the, the number will come down quickly and it has come down a little bit, at times, but it always comes back and comes back strong

179
00:25:52.110 --> 00:26:01.890
Capstone Coach 1: I don't know. And then there are technical indicators. These are market indicators and this these are ever. This is information that's used to

180
00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:22.440
Capstone Coach 1: indicate whether you want to buy or sell an individual stock and that's kind of interesting information. For example, here the first one you have, is it says high usage is the simple moving average for our stock price. So if we click on IBM. You can see what's happening.

181
00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:41.850
Capstone Coach 1: There we go. So you can see the simple moving average for IBM as of today was $124 the actual closing price on IBM today was 130. So the simple moving average is not going to be equal to the actual current, you know,

182
00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:59.340
Capstone Coach 1: sales price. It's going to be equal to what the average would predict for current sales price. So what this is saying, suggesting is that $130 is is higher than what's expected it. If you look at the simple moving average.

183
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:10.440
Capstone Coach 1: And then you can look at the exponentially weighted and moving average, which will be the next one in line. And in the case of IBM. Let's see what it says.

184
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.270
Capstone Coach 1: Same

185
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.000
Capstone Coach 1: So IBM as a little boring.

186
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:23.160
Capstone Coach 1: Very close to the same anyway and then you have a bunch of other indicators hand.

187
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.940
Capstone Coach 1: What is this. Hi.

188
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:37.020
Capstone Coach 1: This is the moving average divergence values. And so let's see what it says for IBM down here.

189
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:55.230
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so today. It says that the moving average to divergence is high 1.6 so that's basically saying that the current price is higher than what the moving average with suggested, so we were talking about earlier.

190
00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:59.610
Capstone Coach 1: Don't know exactly how this is being calculated, but it's something like that.

191
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:07.680
Capstone Coach 1: And so forth and so on. So, these, these are indicators, I think are very interesting from an investment viewpoint, they got a bunch of them.

192
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:18.930
Capstone Coach 1: And I think if you were an investor might be fun to play with those and look at them. The ones, though, that we really should be looking at are up here where it says

193
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:25.380
Capstone Coach 1: Stock time serious now, last night I think I took the intraday

194
00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:47.910
Capstone Coach 1: Values right here. And I think we were talking about that. So I'm going to click on that here for a moment. And this is a time series. Right. So it's showing you the the open the high the low and the clothes for IBM. So it shows it says right here. IBM closed at 129

195
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:54.030
Capstone Coach 1: And 25 cents on January the 19th that's yesterday.

196
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:56.040
Capstone Coach 1: So it's

197
00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:03.420
Capstone Coach 1: It is looking at it on a five minute interval every five minutes. It's capturing that information.

198
00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:20.160
Capstone Coach 1: So you could take this series. This is the series for January the 19th. Let's see. I think it's one day at a time. Yeah. So this, this is the series for January the 19th. I'm assuming there's other ways to get it for earlier time periods, but

199
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:32.790
Capstone Coach 1: If you're a day trader day trader, they will buy in the morning and sell in the afternoon or vice versa. And so they're looking at small changes.

200
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:43.320
Capstone Coach 1: In this pattern of this five minute pattern. And then they are wrapped into that. So if they see somebody jumping in to buy a lot of stock.

201
00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:55.590
Capstone Coach 1: You can look at the volume here, the volume to 10 to 55 if that never would have jump up real quick, then the price is going to go up saying that basically there's an increase in demand and

202
00:29:55.950 --> 00:30:03.090
Capstone Coach 1: Somebody wants IBM stock for some reason. Oh, here's, here's some people doing well here's, here's the volume of 1310

203
00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:07.830
Capstone Coach 1: And you see how the price goes up in the next five minutes.

204
00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:11.760
Capstone Coach 1: Not a lot, but you know a little bit

205
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:18.330
Capstone Coach 1: Of course it could go down, but here's another another big boy or 8628

206
00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:30.330
Capstone Coach 1: And oh, wow. Here's somebody to buy him a four or 54791 and price didn't change much. So I don't know no one's going on there.

207
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:47.070
Capstone Coach 1: Let me show you. I looked at this a little more closely and I decided for our purposes, probably the best one to look at is this one at the bottom, it says quote endpoint. So if you click on quote endpoint.

208
00:30:48.150 --> 00:31:12.000
Capstone Coach 1: You can see that this is for a single stock like IBM or something like that. And what it does is it gives you the ending the closing values for the stock. And so if I click here on on IBM. That's what it gives you. And for us, you can see this is a basically for January the 20th today.

209
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:21.660
Capstone Coach 1: And so I'm assuming this comes out after the market closes and what you're going to get then is you're going to get

210
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:25.530
Capstone Coach 1: The closing price.

211
00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:34.860
Capstone Coach 1: Oh, the price here, the price which is number five is actually the closing price for IBM

212
00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:36.840
Capstone Coach 1: Today,

213
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:42.330
Capstone Coach 1: And then this is the total volume of the stock for today.

214
00:31:44.160 --> 00:32:03.300
Capstone Coach 1: And this is showing you, then the closing price for yesterday. So you have some information about did the stock go up in value and then the percent change right here 1.06 so as a percentage that changes a, an increase a stock price increase of

215
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:09.210
Capstone Coach 1: A 10TH OF 1% small increase of all right.

216
00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:12.540
Karen Fireman: So James stupid question.

217
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:20.460
Karen Fireman: Yeah, well it's Karen when I had tried to get that he needed. I couldn't figure out where it went. And then when I tried it again.

218
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.040
Capstone Coach 1: Hold it said wait a sec. Just a second.

219
00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:26.940
Capstone Coach 1: This is Karen.

220
00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.800
Karen Fireman: KAREN Yeah. Can you hear me.

221
00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:32.280
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, I'm your volume is having a little bit trouble.

222
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:36.450
Capstone Coach 1: It's okay, just talk a little slower.

223
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:38.100
Karen Fireman: I'm sorry.

224
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:39.030
Capstone Coach 1: No, you're good.

225
00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:52.560
Karen Fireman: I was just wondering when I tried to get the alpha advantage key. I, I thought I did. It is very simple steps. I think I got distracted in the class or something and then you're

226
00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:53.550
Capstone Coach 1: Talking about here.

227
00:32:53.820 --> 00:33:03.240
Karen Fireman: Yeah, they are the class started. Anyway, I never saw the key. I went in again. And they said, Oh, we already sent it to you, but I never found it. Where does it go

228
00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:05.700
Capstone Coach 1: Well,

229
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:12.750
Capstone Coach 1: I ran into the same problem. Okay, so you click here where it says give me a key please give me a key.

230
00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:17.550
Capstone Coach 1: And you you provide your information. So, in your case, you would probably be

231
00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:26.430
Capstone Coach 1: Student or something like that and you give the you know the information for the university Texas a&m and your email, right.

232
00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:27.390
Karen Fireman: Yeah, right.

233
00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:37.650
Capstone Coach 1: And you click on it. Guess where the key is on the page. They don't email it to you, cynical. It just shows up in this page.

234
00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:40.170
Karen Fireman: Oh problematic because

235
00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:44.070
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah, well, so it says

236
00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:56.760
Capstone Coach 1: I have gotten my key already. Well, anyway, there's some FAQs down here. But yeah, I had the same person I clicked off the page setup page after I clicked on getting it to me. Give me one, you know,

237
00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.050
Capstone Coach 1: I shut down the page and realized oh

238
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:04.740
Capstone Coach 1: The keys in that page so

239
00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:22.410
Capstone Coach 1: Great at their little there's a little sentence that shot it shows up. I think underneath there, actually. And we couldn't be below your screen, you know, you have to scroll think it shows up somewhere in this area and it says, you know, your key is so and so and it gives you a string. Now,

240
00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:23.010
Okay.

241
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:31.200
Capstone Coach 1: So what can you do, you can write support and ask them to send you the key because using the same email.

242
00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.050
Karen Fireman: I did. I haven't gotten anything back

243
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:36.600
Capstone Coach 1: They haven't send it back.

244
00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:40.290
Karen Fireman: They have a such a reply, nothing. I haven't seen anything back

245
00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:42.090
Capstone Coach 1: When did you send the email.

246
00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:43.800
Karen Fireman: Little earlier today.

247
00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:44.790
Okay.

248
00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:47.880
Capstone Coach 1: All right.

249
00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.910
Capstone Coach 1: Will you listed as a student.

250
00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:53.850
Karen Fireman: Yeah yeah I did all the right things. I just

251
00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:54.330
Capstone Coach 1: Did a

252
00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.670
Karen Fireman: Or was like distracted in the class.

253
00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:57.540
Karen Fireman: And right

254
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:05.490
Capstone Coach 1: Did I give them a little bit more time and then if they don't send them another email and you. In the meantime, you can feel free to use my key.

255
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.420
Karen Fireman: Okay. Which of the. Okay, thanks. It's in one of the

256
00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:11.970
Capstone Coach 1: Things is they didn't like to use. I'll show you in just a minute.

257
00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:15.750
Karen Fireman: Okay, thank you. Sorry about that. Tell me where it goes. I can appreciate it.

258
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:17.280
Capstone Coach 1: Sorry. Good.

259
00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:19.170
So,

260
00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:32.610
Capstone Coach 1: Going back to the documentation so that I think the the statistics that you want to use for your UI is under quote endpoint. And let me click that again.

261
00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:49.260
Capstone Coach 1: Right here. Yeah. So when you go there you have to give them a symbol like IBM and it's going to give you, then all the statistical information and you're doing should report the price. Number five, basically.

262
00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:57.030
Capstone Coach 1: And you could also report the volume. I think that would be cool if you added that information in there.

263
00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:12.180
Capstone Coach 1: And maybe even the percent change. You know, you could add some other information and you're going, but also, although there's expected really, in this case, this is the price right here. Okay, so let's go then to spider.

264
00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:20.010
Capstone Coach 1: And what I'm doing is I'm looking at example three

265
00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:35.430
Capstone Coach 1: Example three, where can you find that, well, if you go to E campus. And if you look at the week one folder I organized things so that it says GUI examples.

266
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:42.360
Capstone Coach 1: So every all of those codes are now organized in a little folder called GUI examples under week one.

267
00:36:43.050 --> 00:37:00.210
Capstone Coach 1: And if you click on that you'll get the examples. And the last one is exercise. Example three. So this is the one that I'm working off of. And what we're going to do is more, this guy so that it pulls out the IBM stock prices.

268
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:07.950
Capstone Coach 1: Going to try to do that. I haven't done really done this yet, so we can you going to watch me make a lot of mistakes, probably you maybe you can help me.

269
00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:20.790
Capstone Coach 1: So what I'd like you to do is if you could go ahead. You know, if you have the time right now and you can, you know, go ahead and open up spider and open up example three. This guy right here.

270
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:38.670
Capstone Coach 1: Now, and you know, put it in the place where you want to work, you know, put this example three code in the folder where you want to populate you want to populate with your examples and things like that. Professor

271
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:44.190
Wilson Pineda: With some here, is it the same example tree from yesterday or a son of the reversion

272
00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:46.170
Capstone Coach 1: Know, this should be the same from

273
00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:47.340
Wilson Pineda: Yesterday. Thank you.

274
00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:48.300
Yeah yeah

275
00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:54.570
Capstone Coach 1: I'm going to now you might want to

276
00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:01.680
Capstone Coach 1: Double check me on that this the last line in this code is 110

277
00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:07.770
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, I don't recall making any changes to this.

278
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:09.690
Capstone Coach 1: But

279
00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:17.820
Capstone Coach 1: I have 109 109 so maybe there's a multi

280
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.200
Karen Fireman: Line 109

281
00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:21.540
Capstone Coach 1: That

282
00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:27.090
Jim Clark: Dr. Johnson. Nice to be critical last night he were showing an example of exercise for

283
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:28.200
Capstone Coach 1: Yes.

284
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.700
Capstone Coach 1: And I deleted that.

285
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.050
Jim Clark: Okay, so

286
00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:34.050
Capstone Coach 1: Let me explain. Since you guys are so observant.

287
00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:40.440
Capstone Coach 1: Exercise for is it is basically example three unclean.

288
00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:52.530
Capstone Coach 1: Oh, so what I did was I actually, what I did was I took example for and then I cleaned it up admitted example three and by cleaning up. I mean, I added comments.

289
00:38:53.430 --> 00:39:06.450
Capstone Coach 1: In the code and then you can see my API. You know, you should have the API key my API have actually two API keys and the one that's for the students is this one. It has an L at the end.

290
00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:14.820
Capstone Coach 1: Si k. And then there's an L. At the end I believe that's the one they said use this one with your students so

291
00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:23.550
Capstone Coach 1: Now that I right now. I have it commented like that in that part of the code that's example that's line.

292
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.670
Capstone Coach 1: And in my code.

293
00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:27.720
Jim Clark: That's what I have

294
00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:34.860
Capstone Coach 1: And but then down here you see there's an API key set to demo. See that

295
00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:42.600
Capstone Coach 1: Yes, sir. This is really where the API key should be now demo, which is what we have here works.

296
00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:51.630
Capstone Coach 1: As long as you're working with the end, you know, Japanese. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go up the line 52

297
00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:58.080
Capstone Coach 1: And I'm going to take that and I'm going to copy it.

298
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.760
Capstone Coach 1: One.

299
00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:03.150
Capstone Coach 1: Like that and delete it.

300
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.520
Capstone Coach 1: And then move it down here where it says demo.

301
00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:18.720
Capstone Coach 1: API key demo, I'm going to put that key right in here instead. Well, what you can do is just put it

302
00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:26.700
Capstone Coach 1: Put it on the line below, like that. And instead of making you know make it on comments like that.

303
00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:29.130
Capstone Coach 1: So,

304
00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:40.740
Capstone Coach 1: So that is the API key that they're allowing us to use under the London. They tell me unlimited and everyone all the class can use it. So that's pretty cool.

305
00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:50.130
Capstone Coach 1: Now I'm going to double check to make sure that it's working right. So I'm going to make run this code, and it should run fine.

306
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:51.930
Capstone Coach 1: And

307
00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:57.720
Capstone Coach 1: It. I'm going to read it does, but I'm going to run it restart the Colonel.

308
00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:03.150
Capstone Coach 1: Restart the curlin run it again because I think I was testing it earlier and

309
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:09.000
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, there we go. And now I'm going to run it and

310
00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:21.030
Capstone Coach 1: So I'm going to put in 100 yen up here in the gooey, which is probably hard to see. And I don't know if I can make that. Let me see if I can make it.

311
00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.800
Capstone Coach 1: Doesn't work convert hit the hit convert

312
00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:46.410
Capstone Coach 1: And yeah point nine seven. It's working. So it accepted that key. I would just check double checking to make sure this is the right unlimited key and it's showing this is correct. So your unlimited key should start with a C and and with an L.

313
00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.290
Capstone Coach 1: Kind of a long, silky there.

314
00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:55.170
Capstone Coach 1: The demo key will work and only work for the US to yen.

315
00:41:56.490 --> 00:41:57.150
Capstone Coach 1: Conversion

316
00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:59.460
Capstone Coach 1: If we try some other

317
00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:09.030
Capstone Coach 1: Currency and I'm going to change you JP y to x MX n Mexican peso

318
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:11.130
Capstone Coach 1: And

319
00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.820
Capstone Coach 1: I'm going to swear is that

320
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:18.450
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, I'm going to stop.

321
00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:22.530
Jim Clark: Some blind move one of six. Now I want to buy

322
00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.620
Capstone Coach 1: 105 yeah

323
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:30.390
Capstone Coach 1: And

324
00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:33.810
Capstone Coach 1: So I'm going to run this and it should

325
00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:36.270
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

326
00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:42.930
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

327
00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:45.270
Jim Clark: It works.

328
00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:51.060
Capstone Coach 1: So I'm gonna put in pesos. I'm going to put in 20 pesos.

329
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:55.860
Jim Clark: The title of it is that right

330
00:42:55.950 --> 00:43:05.610
Capstone Coach 1: And 20 basis is worth $1 and two cents and the exchange rate right now and you can see it written out over here on the right hand side.

331
00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:11.190
Capstone Coach 1: The exchange rate is 19.5635 something like that so

332
00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:15.810
Capstone Coach 1: The peso keeps getting stronger versus the versus the dollar.

333
00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:17.550
Capstone Coach 1: And

334
00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:18.930
Jim Clark: That's it.

335
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:25.650
Capstone Coach 1: That's what I was expecting. Because the price of oil is stable and actually going up for now.

336
00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:29.550
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

337
00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:38.220
Jim Clark: In the window, you want to eat good he would get yen in the input term which is it's mathematically right but i mean

338
00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.750
Capstone Coach 1: Right, it's

339
00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:44.700
Capstone Coach 1: gonna change we're gonna we're gonna do now, if you will follow you if you're going to work with me. Here's

340
00:43:45.210 --> 00:44:01.530
Capstone Coach 1: We're gonna, we're gonna take this example three and we're going to copy it over into a new example. And that's going to be stock price dot t y. So to do that you get inside of example three where we are right now. And then you come up here.

341
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:09.390
Capstone Coach 1: Where it says, Python, and it says file and you want to go to save copy as

342
00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:13.890
Capstone Coach 1: So I'm going to click on Save copy as

343
00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:23.820
Capstone Coach 1: And then I instead of saving it as a example three. I'm going to change that name to stock price.

344
00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:30.870
Capstone Coach 1: Stock Price dot p why

345
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:39.810
Capstone Coach 1: And it's going into a little folder that I set up for for TK TK center, you know. The Goonies and

346
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:45.570
Capstone Coach 1: I wonder if I can make this little thing bigger for you.

347
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:49.680
Capstone Coach 1: Know,

348
00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:55.170
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, that seems to be a

349
00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:58.500
Capstone Coach 1: I hope you could see that it's

350
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:02.130
Jim Clark: A fantasy world wrote

351
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:07.170
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, anyway, so you can call it whatever you want. Put safe.

352
00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:17.430
Capstone Coach 1: Now that new file is going to show up on the far right hand side of whatever files you have open. So I'm going to move it next to

353
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.940
Capstone Coach 1: Drag it over next to example three

354
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:27.660
Capstone Coach 1: So that if I want to go back to example three because I messed something up. I can do that.

355
00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:36.510
Capstone Coach 1: Right. Okay. Let's see what we got here. So first of all, we're going to work with.

356
00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:51.960
Capstone Coach 1: IBM stock prices. So we know what that is. And so the first thing I'm going to look for is by the way your cursor equal to hand if you're on Windows, you want to make that hand to this is line 36

357
00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:58.830
Capstone Coach 1: Hand works great on the Mac, but not on Windows. So I want to change that to hand to

358
00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:12.090
Capstone Coach 1: For those who can I think you're working on the Windows thing. Now, the title of this it says is currency exchange. No, that's not what we're going to do. So we're going to change the currency exchange title to stock price.

359
00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:16.260
Capstone Coach 1: Like that.

360
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:18.570
Capstone Coach 1: And then

361
00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:23.400
Capstone Coach 1: It says yen down here and approximately line 39

362
00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:26.250
Capstone Coach 1: Change in to

363
00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:48.390
Capstone Coach 1: Symbol yes why am Bo L. Now that's a common, common acronym for stock symbol in this case. And so stock symbols are normally three letters, they can be more larger but IBM, for example, is one stock symbol symbol AAPL for Ethel I believe

364
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.230
Capstone Coach 1: And we're done. Now,

365
00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:54.990
Capstone Coach 1: What is the API.

366
00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.640
Jim Clark: Is a ppl ID.

367
00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:57.690
Capstone Coach 1: I don't

368
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:00.750
Capstone Coach 1: Have to look it up. OK.

369
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:04.110
Capstone Coach 1: So the, the root title here is

370
00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:14.130
Capstone Coach 1: We were want to change that rate. Right now it says yen $2 so we're going to change that. I just make that stock price.

371
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:18.660
Capstone Coach 1: Like that.

372
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:32.880
Capstone Coach 1: And now we have a bunch of stuff here about from currency, right, because we're converting from one currency to another. And so we had to send it in, into our gooey.

373
00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:55.800
Capstone Coach 1: These things that you see at the top online number of if you look at that. This is the input to the GUI that's coming from the request now self is always there GUI when is we can leave it like that. Or you could change that if you want. That's the name of the gooey window.

374
00:47:57.090 --> 00:48:10.560
Capstone Coach 1: The canvas, and then you have frumps currency to currency and an API key. Now we want to change the from currency into currency to something different and

375
00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:12.900
Capstone Coach 1: So we're going to

376
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:24.570
Capstone Coach 1: Well, actually, they're going to give us the symbols. So they don't have to give us any information when they call the gooey, they, they, the gooey was going to read the symbol right

377
00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:33.960
Capstone Coach 1: So we can just eliminate the the from and the to currency just could cover it up like that and erase it, you don't need that.

378
00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:53.520
Capstone Coach 1: And then everywhere in the code that you see those things being used. Like here we have from currency equal to from currency. Right. We want to get rid of those any, any place in the code where you see from or to currency. You want to get rid of that. So,

379
00:48:54.540 --> 00:49:00.330
Capstone Coach 1: Let's see. Where else that was that was that's his line approximately 15

380
00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:09.030
Capstone Coach 1: And there was a couple lines underneath there. And then let's see, do we have the from the two is going to be here somewhere.

381
00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:17.430
Capstone Coach 1: Oh,

382
00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:23.160
Capstone Coach 1: I think that's. Oh, here it is.

383
00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:38.970
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah problem to currency or are we don't need to use those we took those out there just two lines up here at the top.

384
00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:58.470
Capstone Coach 1: Then you have a function called convert which we can just leave it alone. We don't. And then we have one called real time currency exchange and we're going to change the name of this from real time currency exchange rate to something

385
00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.780
Capstone Coach 1: Real time

386
00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.660
Capstone Coach 1: No stock.

387
00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:25.200
Capstone Coach 1: Underscore, this is my you can call it, EVERYONE, CLOSE. So we're going to basically give out statistical information on the closing all that stock for the end of the day, that would be the price, the volume, whatever, whatever you want to do there, but it's the closing information.

388
00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:38.340
Capstone Coach 1: And so then we have I base URL. Right now it says currency exchange rate, we need to change that. So if we go to the website.

389
00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:46.380
Capstone Coach 1: Where we have that information we were looking at. And let me go here.

390
00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:54.540
Capstone Coach 1: So we're going to go to the to the documentation documentation and click on quote endpoint.

391
00:50:55.830 --> 00:51:02.850
Capstone Coach 1: Now, let me see if I can raise this. Yeah, I can do this. This is great, make this larger for you.

392
00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:13.380
Capstone Coach 1: You can see what's going on. So yeah, when you go to stock time series and then go to quote endpoint like that.

393
00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:25.980
Capstone Coach 1: And then this on the right hand side is the the the documentation for stock endpoint. So there are some parameters that were required

394
00:51:29.370 --> 00:51:32.160
Capstone Coach 1: There. They're called API parameters.

395
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:38.280
Capstone Coach 1: So you know the the program information that

396
00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:48.690
Capstone Coach 1: The application program information that's being sent over. This is a list of the variables that you need to send to code endpoint.

397
00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:56.670
Capstone Coach 1: And two of them are required. One is the function that you want to look at

398
00:51:57.870 --> 00:52:08.490
Capstone Coach 1: And then the simple, simple, those are two required things and then you have optional information. And by default, it gives you a JSON file.

399
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:28.380
Capstone Coach 1: But you could also ask for a CSV file. We're going to take the default. So we're not going to change the data type, just leave it as Jason and then another required thing the API key. Yeah, of course. And the symbol will be, for example, IBM

400
00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:33.210
Capstone Coach 1: And the function is is a different animal.

401
00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:41.850
Capstone Coach 1: Now, if we move down there is an example here showing how to get this information using your browser.

402
00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:51.720
Capstone Coach 1: And you can see what they were expecting. But what this does is it shows you what they expect to see in your browser, right.

403
00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:53.610
Capstone Coach 1: So,

404
00:52:55.110 --> 00:53:18.990
Capstone Coach 1: In this case we want to change that base URL to quote global underscore quote. So if I go back to the code, what we're talking about right here it says currency exchange rate. Let me see if I can make this larger yeah I can do that.

405
00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:21.720
Okay.

406
00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:28.590
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah. Is that, is that okay can you see that on your screen.

407
00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.730
Capstone Coach 1: The code. I hope so.

408
00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:34.080
Jim Clark: Yes, sir. It's good.

409
00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:55.590
Capstone Coach 1: So the 68 law approximately 168 is the function we're working on and I changed the name of the function from real time currency exchange to stock close now there's a there is a description says function to get real time currency exchange, I would say to get stock close

410
00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:59.970
Capstone Coach 1: Close information.

411
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:03.240
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, on that.

412
00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:07.380
Capstone Coach 1: Little quote from your comment.

413
00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:18.810
Capstone Coach 1: So the base URL is currently said says currency exchange rate, we want to change currency exchange rate to

414
00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:23.850
Capstone Coach 1: To cap boxes on global

415
00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:27.000
Capstone Coach 1: Underscore

416
00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:29.910
Capstone Coach 1: And what was the other thing we spoke

417
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:31.200
Jim Clark: qu O. T.

418
00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:33.090
Capstone Coach 1: Okay. Shoot, quote, quote,

419
00:54:34.500 --> 00:54:34.920
Capstone Coach 1: Like that.

420
00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:45.690
Capstone Coach 1: And then there is a second line which is the the information that you're passing into the

421
00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:48.390
Capstone Coach 1: The API.

422
00:54:49.530 --> 00:55:06.180
Capstone Coach 1: Notice it says base URL. Plus, and then it gets a bunch of information. The information is all plus, plus, plus, what we're doing here is creating a string and we want that screw a string to look like.

423
00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:10.770
Jim Clark: At the print out

424
00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:13.320
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah, like the printed out exactly

425
00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:19.680
Jim Clark: So you're just basically a strange though we want some bold equal to something and API equal to something right

426
00:55:20.130 --> 00:55:23.760
Capstone Coach 1: So we want to we want to reproduce this sort of business right here.

427
00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:32.580
Capstone Coach 1: Alright, so that the two required things are symbol and the API and

428
00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:34.800
Capstone Coach 1: So that was

429
00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:38.070
Capstone Coach 1: Up here.

430
00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:40.410
Capstone Coach 1: Symbol

431
00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:47.400
Capstone Coach 1: And API, the sub the function, by the way, is global, quote, global quote

432
00:55:48.900 --> 00:56:00.330
Capstone Coach 1: So that's what we just did on the base URLs. Put that global quote. Now we want to put in symbol and API like that. So it's pretty, pretty easy. In this case, so let's go back to

433
00:56:00.570 --> 00:56:02.220
Karen Fireman: Sir, one question. It's Karen.

434
00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:12.180
Karen Fireman: Yeah, but that's like it might afford and wire the IBM name in there. I thought we were trying to ask that as a choice.

435
00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:13.950
Capstone Coach 1: Oh, we are we are

436
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:15.600
Capstone Coach 1: We will

437
00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:30.480
Capstone Coach 1: So where it was. So let's go back to the because of the code will see what's going on here. So, in previous code, we have the from currency and then to currency and this information was coming off the

438
00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:32.130
Capstone Coach 1: The

439
00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:35.220
Capstone Coach 1: Gooey I think

440
00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:36.930
Capstone Coach 1: Well,

441
00:56:38.010 --> 00:56:44.460
Capstone Coach 1: So here where it says, and the front from currency. We're now let's make that symbol.

442
00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:49.170
Capstone Coach 1: Loops.

443
00:56:52.890 --> 00:57:10.530
Capstone Coach 1: And then instead of self thought from currency. Let's make itself dot simple. Now we haven't captured. Yeah, but it's, we're going to do that, we have just a second and then erase the line underneath it.

444
00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:17.280
Capstone Coach 1: And we have an API key equal to self bought API key like that.

445
00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:21.900
Capstone Coach 1: So this is actually an easier example.

446
00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:23.670
Capstone Coach 1: So far,

447
00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:38.850
Capstone Coach 1: And and then this this next line requests since that URL to their to their website requesting of the JSON file and then we take the JSON file.

448
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:50.340
Capstone Coach 1: That comes back as an object oriented. I'll be j and parse it, and then we we get the right here. It's saying the exchange rate. Well, no, no, no, no, we don't face right now.

449
00:57:51.450 --> 00:57:54.870
Capstone Coach 1: So we're going to change the exchange rate to

450
00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:58.410
Capstone Coach 1: Close price.

451
00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:13.740
Capstone Coach 1: closing price. And then we have to change this information right here. Here it says real time currency exchange rate and then you can see there's a second

452
00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:29.940
Capstone Coach 1: Key five point exchange rate. I think this is supposed to be 5.4. Let's go back. Let me go back to the documentation right here and let's click on this to see what's coming back. This is the Jason file.

453
00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:44.640
Capstone Coach 1: So I think we want in that first part of the key is global, quote, if you see this Jason file is it looks like a dictionary. It looks like a Python dictionary. Notice these little quote marks.

454
00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:55.560
Capstone Coach 1: So this is a this is a dictionary within a dictionary, the outer quote marks the all there's only one key global quote

455
00:58:56.850 --> 00:59:10.980
Capstone Coach 1: And then the enter the inside quotes. You see, here, and here I have several keys that I can access. One of the 05 period price. So we want global quotes

456
00:59:11.850 --> 00:59:25.350
Capstone Coach 1: 05 period space price and this should then return this number as a string, by the way, notice that this is all free and treated as strings in this JSON file.

457
00:59:26.310 --> 00:59:35.010
Capstone Coach 1: So let's go back to the, quote, then we'll, we'll do. We'll go back here. So where it says real time currency exchange rate. Let's make that global

458
00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:38.220
Capstone Coach 1: Space quote

459
00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:48.180
Capstone Coach 1: It is case sensitive, so we get on that. Now, this should be zero, it looked like it was using 05 and price.

460
00:59:52.260 --> 01:00:01.230
Capstone Coach 1: So I'm thinking, this should work. But who knows. We'll try. We'll test it out and then we're going to return the clothes price.

461
01:00:04.110 --> 01:00:06.240
Capstone Coach 1: As a floating point number

462
01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:18.210
Capstone Coach 1: See that return the floating point number and also just for the heck of it, return the entire Jason file in case there's something else in there that we want to grab later on.

463
01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:40.920
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, well, actually I use. I use that information to print out information over here on the right hand side, it's just a extra thing. So I think we got this, we got this function set up the way we wanted it conforms to the requirements for the website that we're accessing

464
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:51.300
Capstone Coach 1: Now, just as a side note, total side note, I have. I've also written programs like this to access Twitter social media and all that.

465
01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:58.980
Capstone Coach 1: It's the same thing, by the way, you go to Twitter and you register as a developer and get an API key.

466
01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:09.870
Capstone Coach 1: And then you go through and look at the documentation their online documentation for the Twitter API. And that documentation will show you in Python.

467
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:24.480
Capstone Coach 1: How to access Twitter feeds and how to send out a tweet using Python, if you want to. And that's true with Twitter with Facebook and all the other guys that, you know, social media people

468
01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:35.160
Capstone Coach 1: And at one time, you could get into that information. It was pretty deep like they'd give you the phone number of people and things like that, but now they've shut that some of that down.

469
01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:48.510
Capstone Coach 1: Limiting things. So this is your stock close and let's go back up to the gooey right in here.

470
01:01:49.740 --> 01:02:02.310
Capstone Coach 1: Because there are a couple of things that that I want. I need to do. One of them is, it says right here, convert this is the button right now it's labeled as convert let's change that to price.

471
01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:05.010
Capstone Coach 1: So,

472
01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:19.440
Capstone Coach 1: So we know what that button is supposed to do. And notice that the command says self thought convert. Well, it's no longer convert know we're calling another the function and that function is

473
01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:22.620
Capstone Coach 1: Stuck close

474
01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:24.480
Capstone Coach 1: And

475
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:36.150
Capstone Coach 1: Score close. I made a mistake when I created that function I put in a capital S. So I'm going to make that a little ass.

476
01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.470
Capstone Coach 1: And a little see for clothes.

477
01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:51.090
Capstone Coach 1: So case sensitive. So, the function is stock close so the underscore between all lowercase and then up here on the button.

478
01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.400
Capstone Coach 1: We have

479
01:02:54.510 --> 01:03:03.390
Capstone Coach 1: The function name right in here, stock close. So when you click this button. What it does is it executes that function. Now that function.

480
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.950
Capstone Coach 1: Notice the only thing that's being passed is self.

481
01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:17.190
Capstone Coach 1: What this says is that this stuck function here has access to all of the variables that are in the gooey.

482
01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:29.310
Capstone Coach 1: And so everywhere that it says like stock API key that function has access to the key. If it needs it. Well, it does need it. It does use the key right

483
01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:31.290
Capstone Coach 1: So,

484
01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:45.390
Capstone Coach 1: How's it getting that key. Well, right here. When we say self API key equaled API key we are creating a variable inside the gooey and now any function we call inside this class.

485
01:03:46.410 --> 01:03:54.060
Capstone Coach 1: And who we pass over the self is going to have access to that key and all other information that as self in front of it.

486
01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:58.140
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, now we need to get the symbol right

487
01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:26.040
Capstone Coach 1: Well, the symbol is coming from the previously, it's coming from here FX from that's the exchange rate from bits getting the yen that JP JP y or or MSN string. Instead, we're going to, we're going to get the symbol stock symbol. So it says ethics from let's just change that to symbol.

488
01:04:28.170 --> 01:04:28.470
Capstone Coach 1: Like

489
01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:35.610
Capstone Coach 1: And FX from entry which make that just symbol entry.

490
01:04:40.770 --> 01:04:42.570
Capstone Coach 1: And now this is

491
01:04:44.070 --> 01:04:51.750
Capstone Coach 1: The text variable, the text variables. It says FX from make that symbol.

492
01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:55.110
Capstone Coach 1: And

493
01:04:56.250 --> 01:05:06.150
Capstone Coach 1: And then we're telling where to put the the entry. So let's make that symbol entry instead of ethics from entry.

494
01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:17.280
Capstone Coach 1: Like that. Okay. Only just hesitate here for a minute. I know some of you are probably typing. I'm just gonna let you take a look at that set that up right

495
01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:21.510
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

496
01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:31.260
Capstone Coach 1: And so basically we each everywhere. It says FX underscore from we made that symbol.

497
01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:35.520
Capstone Coach 1: Symbol or symbol underscore

498
01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:38.220
Capstone Coach 1: Entry

499
01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:44.190
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

500
01:05:51.330 --> 01:06:05.340
Capstone Coach 1: Now let's take a look at the the button here. We already set up the button is going to going to trigger that question about the price and we have this is equal to

501
01:06:06.510 --> 01:06:12.060
Capstone Coach 1: This is some text that's being printed. Let's see his clothes. Make that clothes price.

502
01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:19.800
Capstone Coach 1: And

503
01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:30.780
Capstone Coach 1: Instead of dollars is fine. The actual prices in dollars us USD and so instead of dollars. Let's make this USD

504
01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:33.720
Capstone Coach 1: US dollars.

505
01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:47.370
Capstone Coach 1: Word dollars can be different thing, and Mexico. They use the term dollars to refer to pesos. And you'll be you'll be see like $2 million. So say what

506
01:06:49.320 --> 01:07:02.370
Capstone Coach 1: Instead of to me and bases in the look for you're looking at an apartment or something like that and it'll department is a monthly rent will be like $20,000 is that what they mean is 20,000 pesos.

507
01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:12.090
Karen Fireman: Sir, I have a question for you. Um, I think Wilson pointed out on 46 that we needed to change the effects from do we also change a 47

508
01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.010
Karen Fireman: Or FC there.

509
01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:15.030
Capstone Coach 1: I didn't

510
01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:16.200
Karen Fireman: Convert stay there.

511
01:07:16.830 --> 01:07:19.500
Capstone Coach 1: This one down here. Yeah, let's change that back to something

512
01:07:21.030 --> 01:07:21.660
Capstone Coach 1: Simple

513
01:07:22.110 --> 01:07:24.870
Karen Fireman: What about the next line that convert this that stare that

514
01:07:25.290 --> 01:07:31.500
Capstone Coach 1: It says self convert. Yeah, we need to change convert to. Well now, hang on, hang on.

515
01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:33.600
Capstone Coach 1: Wait a minute.

516
01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.920
Capstone Coach 1: We're not really using this function convert

517
01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:52.710
Capstone Coach 1: And this function was see this a little bit different when you're doing the conversion, you have to get the, the current rate. And then you have to make a calculation. You can see the USD calculation right here.

518
01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:59.190
Capstone Coach 1: Let's go ahead and just erase this function because I think it's going to confuse people.

519
01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:04.620
Capstone Coach 1: And so I'm good your race that

520
01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:11.160
Capstone Coach 1: Convert we know where to, you know, we can go to school back to example three and look at it if you need to.

521
01:08:11.850 --> 01:08:24.660
Capstone Coach 1: Do something like that. But what that what will we doing an example three that we're not doing here is we're we're taking the information and then making another calculation based upon that information and so

522
01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:30.300
Capstone Coach 1: We were calling convert and convert within was using the exchange rate.

523
01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:35.070
Capstone Coach 1: Now let's let's go through and see what we have here before we crack

524
01:08:35.130 --> 01:08:40.860
Karen Fireman: So we are in week one second, we still call that convert. So do we did we take that line. Now, where do you see

525
01:08:41.370 --> 01:08:45.600
Capstone Coach 1: You. Oh, we definitely we're going to change that. But let's, let's see, first of all,

526
01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:53.130
Jim Clark: Those the we've put. There's an API key that's that's in there and your code that didn't have

527
01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:58.680
Jim Clark: The keys up. Can I just put that key up higher, so that it's always there.

528
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:06.060
Jim Clark: I guess I'm looking to see where the in your code where the, where your API key is

529
01:09:06.330 --> 01:09:09.060
Capstone Coach 1: Right here online 16 okay

530
01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:11.010
Capstone Coach 1: You see that

531
01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:13.170
Jim Clark: Yes, I see that but

532
01:09:13.230 --> 01:09:15.690
Karen Fireman: But here's the real key. Where's the number

533
01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:22.950
Capstone Coach 1: That real case as you go to the bottom. We're right now we're working inside the gooey at the bottom right.

534
01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:25.020
Karen Fireman: There is 85 or something. Yeah.

535
01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:43.920
Capstone Coach 1: Out the bottom. This is where you call the gooey. Right. So right now it says my gooey exchange good we got to change all this, this is wrong. It says exchange gooey, would we refer did we still call it change doing. Oh, it is. Yeah. Let's change this. Let's change this to stock gooey.

536
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:48.630
Capstone Coach 1: Gooey would call it stuck doing

537
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:55.290
Capstone Coach 1: And down here at the bottom where it says exchange going make the stock.

538
01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:09.630
Capstone Coach 1: And remove from currency and to currency, the only thing you need to send in is the route canvas that set up here.

539
01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:12.810
Capstone Coach 1: And the API key.

540
01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:19.650
Capstone Coach 1: You can you can eliminate the from currency and to currency down here to it's not needed.

541
01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:25.830
Karen Fireman: You remind us with the route actually does the TK call

542
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:32.910
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah, just so as this should be stuck to you. Okay, um,

543
01:10:36.330 --> 01:10:37.740
Capstone Coach 1: The this guy up here route.

544
01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:39.210
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

545
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:41.310
Karen Fireman: Yes.

546
01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:51.690
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, this is creating the blank. This is grabbing a blank canvas from a package called TK

547
01:10:53.040 --> 01:11:10.110
Capstone Coach 1: And where does that know this. This is one of the things that I found personally kind of confusing. If you look at the import up here. You don't see any capital TK right you're thinking, I'm thinking, okay, wait a minute, hold it, hold it rude is equal to capital TK what

548
01:11:11.670 --> 01:11:23.040
Capstone Coach 1: From what is capital TK, is it looks like a function. Right. Well, it turns out it's a class. It's a huge package class and that class.

549
01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:36.300
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, a little bit of a history here. Okay. I like talking about this because its history. Right. So in the beginning, there was a package called TK capital T okay that package was in see

550
01:11:37.440 --> 01:12:01.200
Capstone Coach 1: It was later converted to Java, and then later still brought into Python. Now, when they brought that see package into kind Python what they had to do was to envelop it putting it inside a Python package. So what did they do they pulled it may put it into a Python package called T kenter

551
01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:14.760
Capstone Coach 1: So this guy right here where you see it says from decanter import everything that little asterisk means everything it's bringing in that TK see package.

552
01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:19.680
Capstone Coach 1: And so right down here at the bottom, which is like what

553
01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:30.570
Capstone Coach 1: This is saying, Oh, well, yeah, go into Tim Tim T kenter and and and grab a canvas from this see package.

554
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:46.500
Capstone Coach 1: To enter by the way understands that this is a see package and puts in the hooks to make this transfer, but basically you're instantiated or taking a new copy of a blank canvas and you're calling it route.

555
01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:50.820
Capstone Coach 1: And you're going deep inside tick. Enter to get that copy

556
01:12:52.290 --> 01:12:56.730
Capstone Coach 1: And then you can. There are things you can do with TK

557
01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:12.660
Capstone Coach 1: And run them is you can assign a title to the campus. And this, you don't have to, but it's optional. You can put a title on the canvas and so that'll be a little top little information all this gooey his stock price, you know,

558
01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:24.750
Capstone Coach 1: So when you called your UI your T kenter gooey. You have to pass in that TK canvas and that's right here route. Right.

559
01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:41.730
Capstone Coach 1: So that's always required and then this website that we're working with requires the API key as well. And you can pass other information in here that you might need inside the GUI, and that's allowed as well. Right.

560
01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:47.370
Capstone Coach 1: So okay, so that was a good. That's a fun question. Thank you.

561
01:13:49.170 --> 01:13:53.940
Capstone Coach 1: Because that's something I was going to mentioned, but I didn't want to get too confusing and the class.

562
01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:55.380
Karen Fireman: Right now, is one of the thing.

563
01:13:57.060 --> 01:13:57.870
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah, go ahead.

564
01:13:58.140 --> 01:13:58.620
Karen Fireman: I'm sorry, sir.

565
01:13:58.770 --> 01:14:01.200
Karen Fireman: You had something called pack left and right.

566
01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:09.540
Karen Fireman: It's not a function that we know about its comes up somewhere as like a method or something, something.

567
01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:28.800
Capstone Coach 1: Oh yeah, he died inside of TK, you know that see package, there is a there is a method called pack and that method basically takes whatever widgets, you're working on, puts it on the canvas. Now in the in the other one of the examples, and I think it was example.

568
01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:43.260
Capstone Coach 1: One day, or one be one day, I think if I this is one day I'm just don't bother looking at it at its don't bother bringing this up, but you'll see there's a pack command right here. See that

569
01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:49.320
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah, that back then is going inside of TK. It says, Put this button there or the label.

570
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:53.520
Capstone Coach 1: And then an example one be right here.

571
01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:56.460
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

572
01:14:58.170 --> 01:15:11.730
Capstone Coach 1: It's not, you don't see it back later. You don't see it back command. And that's because this TCK label has it built in there it's automatically built in there to do that operation, put it on the canvas.

573
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:13.590
Capstone Coach 1: So,

574
01:15:15.210 --> 01:15:19.800
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah, it's a little know there's a lot going on here that you don't see

575
01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:31.440
Capstone Coach 1: That's not intuitively a, you know, obvious or described description currency to dollars. Now let's just make the description closing stock price.

576
01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:40.110
Capstone Coach 1: And this year, there's the documentation.

577
01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.270
Capstone Coach 1: And we're using

578
01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.560
Capstone Coach 1: What did they call that let

579
01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:53.250
Capstone Coach 1: Me go back here to

580
01:15:58.410 --> 01:16:07.230
Capstone Coach 1: Quote endpoint. Yeah, using quote endpoint. So I'm going to add that information, quote,

581
01:16:10.170 --> 01:16:11.010
Capstone Coach 1: Endpoint.

582
01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.740
Capstone Coach 1: From alpha

583
01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:20.940
Capstone Coach 1: Manage

584
01:16:24.030 --> 01:16:25.020
Capstone Coach 1: Like that. Okay.

585
01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:30.210
Capstone Coach 1: So a year from now when I look at this little have a better idea about what I'm doing.

586
01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:32.940
Capstone Coach 1: I can't remember this stuff.

587
01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:35.400
Capstone Coach 1: So,

588
01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:42.210
Capstone Coach 1: Let's see. Where are we alright so I hope that got your question, Karen.

589
01:16:43.290 --> 01:16:44.520
Capstone Coach 1: What too confusing.

590
01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:46.290
Karen Fireman: Yes or no. That was very big help.

591
01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:54.240
Capstone Coach 1: Thank you. Okay, yeah. So then what we're doing here is something really sophisticated

592
01:16:55.410 --> 01:17:03.360
Capstone Coach 1: You're, you're doing multi threading, which means that you're writing code where you have several things going on at the same time.

593
01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:11.700
Capstone Coach 1: You can have to go the squeeze on the screen at the same time doing different things and they were not going to crash into each other.

594
01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:24.090
Capstone Coach 1: Because you're creating symbols, you're creating variables rather that are inside the code for that one of each group has its own separate code, right. That's the reason for the self.

595
01:17:24.690 --> 01:17:35.190
Capstone Coach 1: The self thing is telling Python that these variables. So they're only inside this class don't show them to anybody else. Nobody else can get to them.

596
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:48.720
Capstone Coach 1: Whereas this guy without the self in front of it right here. This guy is owned by the original code that called the gooey right down here.

597
01:17:49.650 --> 01:18:07.770
Capstone Coach 1: So down here. The original name of that is root. So the code down here has owns that variable called roots, which is how it just by happenstance. It gets the name change right here, but it's the same in memory. It's the same thing.

598
01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:13.800
Capstone Coach 1: We could have put route here, but I don't like that. So never

599
01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:23.760
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so you're you're doing some you're doing some multi tasking multi. It's called multi threading.

600
01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:33.690
Capstone Coach 1: You, you're able to create this class and then instantiated or create copies of it in the same program all at the same time.

601
01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:39.570
Capstone Coach 1: And they're not going to crash with one another. They're going to be running seven separate parts of memory.

602
01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:49.620
Capstone Coach 1: And they will have their own clock and their own supervisor and everything like that. So you don't you don't get a major system crash or computer crash while you're doing that.

603
01:18:50.340 --> 01:18:59.160
Capstone Coach 1: This is, this is the heart of parallel programming. And if you want to write some code that you know you're doing several things all at the same time.

604
01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:03.990
Capstone Coach 1: They're all running simultaneously. This is sort of the way you would do it. You'd set up.

605
01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:14.340
Capstone Coach 1: Different objects or different classes and then make sure that the variables inside those objects or classes are protected or not given you know they're not variables from

606
01:19:15.330 --> 01:19:23.700
Capstone Coach 1: That are called Global so down here, the root variable in the API key. Those are global variables, which means that anybody

607
01:19:25.710 --> 01:19:46.770
Capstone Coach 1: This code anybody anything in this code can access that variable, the variables that you see with self in front of them like self GYN G when that's a copy of that global variable that is maintained only inside this class, and only with the

608
01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:50.100
Capstone Coach 1: Instance, that's created so

609
01:19:51.120 --> 01:20:08.520
Capstone Coach 1: down here in the bottom. You say my goal equal to stock go here, right, you're creating an instance of that class, and it's known by its name right here. My going okay you could, and we'll, we'll probably do this a little bit later on in the course, you could say.

610
01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:15.450
Capstone Coach 1: The gooey or whatever. Or you could just say gooey to

611
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:19.650
Capstone Coach 1: As equal to stock gooey.

612
01:20:21.930 --> 01:20:22.380
Capstone Coach 1: Right.

613
01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:28.080
Capstone Coach 1: And really the the whole thing is everything else as well.

614
01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:36.210
Capstone Coach 1: You do something like this. Okay, except you would want to do this, you'd say route two

615
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:42.870
Capstone Coach 1: Equals TK like that and you know route to title.

616
01:20:45.630 --> 01:20:47.640
Capstone Coach 1: Title equals to

617
01:20:49.530 --> 01:20:49.920
Capstone Coach 1: You know,

618
01:20:51.450 --> 01:20:52.560
Capstone Coach 1: See stock.

619
01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:55.860
Capstone Coach 1: Price like that.

620
01:20:57.750 --> 01:21:13.020
Capstone Coach 1: And then you could you could create a second copy of the GUI, and this so this would be rude to here using another canvas. I wouldn't want to use the same canvas, because you could prove you know I don't know exactly. Python has some funny memory.

621
01:21:14.430 --> 01:21:19.650
Capstone Coach 1: Things that are very different from C and Java and so

622
01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:27.450
Capstone Coach 1: Be a little bit careful about that. I think you'd have to create another canvas right here.

623
01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:35.190
Capstone Coach 1: API key is, you're not really changing the API key. So as long as you're not changing the API key or

624
01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:46.110
Capstone Coach 1: You're good. But if you wanted to change the API key. You could, and you'd have to put a different name an acronym right here, provide key like demo or whatever API demo or something like that.

625
01:21:48.270 --> 01:22:03.510
Capstone Coach 1: And then it says route main loop. You could just say route two main loop. Boom. Boom. So you could create two instances of this gooey and you could operate each one individually different from one another. And that should work.

626
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:13.770
Capstone Coach 1: As long as you have protected the variables that are being used inside the class and I think we have that we've done that here. So,

627
01:22:15.150 --> 01:22:18.810
Capstone Coach 1: This is a little bit further than I wanted to go tonight. So after race it

628
01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:22.170
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah, we're good.

629
01:22:25.530 --> 01:22:32.400
Capstone Coach 1: Okay. And so this is not done yet. There's still some problem or some problems in here.

630
01:22:33.630 --> 01:22:34.710
Capstone Coach 1: Let's see what we have.

631
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.940
Capstone Coach 1: Well,

632
01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:49.650
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, let's get lazy and just debug it. Right. So I'm going to go up here to console. And I'm going to restart the Colonel, just to make sure that we're starting with a clean slate.

633
01:22:51.540 --> 01:23:06.930
Capstone Coach 1: And there are some problems in here. Let's see if we can find them and get them corrected. So I hit go. Boom. And it says stock GI object has no attribute convert I have line number 47

634
01:23:07.890 --> 01:23:24.690
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah, this is the year right yeah I'm sorry, it doesn't. So it's expecting this to be a function or a variable or something like that. So for now, let's just comment that whole line out

635
01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:33.450
Capstone Coach 1: And run it and see whether we get any anything better coming out. So comment that out.

636
01:23:34.530 --> 01:23:35.160
Capstone Coach 1: Get run

637
01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:37.920
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

638
01:23:39.330 --> 01:23:39.780
Capstone Coach 1: Hmm.

639
01:23:41.130 --> 01:23:43.590
Capstone Coach 1: All right, I don't see anything running

640
01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:47.040
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah, there is right here.

641
01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:57.060
Capstone Coach 1: There are actually two of these guys. The first one I have two copies. One of them was created when I had the error. Right. So I'm going to kill it.

642
01:23:58.170 --> 01:24:11.400
Capstone Coach 1: And notice that the number two here is still running. If you see the red square up on the upper near the upper right here that says that the thread is running. And you also have a number two.

643
01:24:12.330 --> 01:24:25.080
Capstone Coach 1: Working program is running right now. So I think this is the right thing. So we're going to turn into type into symbol IBM well oh well he like that.

644
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:34.050
Capstone Coach 1: Close price. Well, let's see. We hit price. Notice hand my hand does not look like the cool hand that you do you have

645
01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:46.800
Capstone Coach 1: Little difference between windows and Max like it's a little pointer here little finger pointing so well. Anyway, let's see what happens. Okay, so I have another error. And let's see what it says.

646
01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:54.960
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, it says line 56 in stock close, blah, blah.

647
01:24:56.310 --> 01:25:16.650
Capstone Coach 1: Can only content concatenate the string and string is a variable is a is a number. So let's see. Let's see what's going on here. So this is line 56. Let's go and see what what happened there line 56 it's complaining about this symbol.

648
01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:21.870
Capstone Coach 1: And so it's saying that this is not

649
01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:29.160
Capstone Coach 1: A string. Let's see what happened. Let's see where so how symbol was created.

650
01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:33.060
Capstone Coach 1: stock symbol string variable. Hmm.

651
01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:35.850
Capstone Coach 1: stock symbol entry.

652
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:41.730
Capstone Coach 1: Oh, I know what I know what the problem is, I think,

653
01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:44.670
Capstone Coach 1: You see here it says, Oh, no.

654
01:25:45.870 --> 01:25:46.650
Capstone Coach 1: That's fine.

655
01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:56.400
Capstone Coach 1: So let's let's prove out what stock symbol actually looks like.

656
01:25:58.770 --> 01:26:00.390
Capstone Coach 1: Before we call the Skype.

657
01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:07.770
Capstone Coach 1: So it's complaining about the stock close in line 56

658
01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:19.950
Capstone Coach 1: Symbol

659
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:27.570
Clay Coleman: So it's returning as a PI very zero P why underscore bears zero

660
01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:37.200
Capstone Coach 1: Let's see, what is the I'm trying not where you are yet. I'm looking at line 56 right here.

661
01:26:39.150 --> 01:26:39.810
Capstone Coach 1: And

662
01:26:42.420 --> 01:26:44.340
Capstone Coach 1: I can only count enough string variable.

663
01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:47.310
Amanda Pham: Is it symbol underscore entry.

664
01:26:58.860 --> 01:26:59.430
Capstone Coach 1: Entry

665
01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:12.360
Capstone Coach 1: So what did you say the, the, the value actually is a self symbol.

666
01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:19.470
Clay Coleman: If you, if you print the self, self.

667
01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:24.540
Clay Coleman: Self symbol it's P why underscore var zero

668
01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:32.490
Clay Coleman: Both the same

669
01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:34.770
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, I'm gonna

670
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:36.660
Clay Coleman: play another not one second.

671
01:27:36.690 --> 01:27:42.810
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah, let me catch up to you here. I'm not not as quick as you are so

672
01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:50.640
Capstone Coach 1: I'm going to print out self symbol and self symbol underscore entry.

673
01:27:51.660 --> 01:27:55.110
Capstone Coach 1: And see what happens here. Okay, so there we go.

674
01:27:56.910 --> 01:27:58.350
Capstone Coach 1: And so I'm going to

675
01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:00.900
Capstone Coach 1: Type in IBM

676
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:04.740
Capstone Coach 1: And head price. Oh.

677
01:28:06.150 --> 01:28:08.550
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, there it is.

678
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:10.590
Capstone Coach 1: So,

679
01:28:12.450 --> 01:28:14.340
Capstone Coach 1: What is. Wow.

680
01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:23.190
Capstone Coach 1: What is printing out is garbage P why underscore borrows hero dot and frame dot entry.

681
01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:24.870
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

682
01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:33.960
Capstone Coach 1: Well, we'll garbage. All right.

683
01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:37.620
Capstone Coach 1: Let's go back up here and take a look and see what we're doing.

684
01:28:38.610 --> 01:28:41.640
Clay Coleman: It looks like you have to do a var get

685
01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:46.650
Capstone Coach 1: A wine.

686
01:28:47.850 --> 01:28:52.950
Clay Coleman: Bar get gets the variable of ours, a reference to take enter into bar.

687
01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:00.690
Clay Coleman: Need to call get in method through represents the value

688
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:19.290
Clay Coleman: So we, the other one we weren't actually pulling because we had a hard coded to symbols from into Japan. So you were changing them in your code. This one we're actually pulling from the user input and putting into

689
01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:20.310
Clay Coleman: Your URL.

690
01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:27.090
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah, so, and the other one we pull the information from here dollars.

691
01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:32.580
Capstone Coach 1: See where it self, self dot dollars equals to our bad guy.

692
01:29:37.170 --> 01:29:37.950
Capstone Coach 1: So,

693
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:42.900
Capstone Coach 1: There's, there's the problem. We got some confusion here.

694
01:29:45.390 --> 01:29:48.360
Capstone Coach 1: Column to row one column to row two.

695
01:29:49.710 --> 01:29:52.320
Capstone Coach 1: Let's see, so come to row one.

696
01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:58.140
Capstone Coach 1: Let's take it when we take a look at what that what that looks like.

697
01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:07.320
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so the first one.

698
01:30:08.370 --> 01:30:14.880
Capstone Coach 1: This guy on symbol is is operating on real one column two, which would be the word symbol.

699
01:30:16.290 --> 01:30:17.130
Capstone Coach 1: That's a label.

700
01:30:20.190 --> 01:30:25.440
Capstone Coach 1: And then the second one is column to Oh, row two.

701
01:30:28.410 --> 01:30:40.140
Capstone Coach 1: So that would be. Oh, so this is column one right here where you see close price. And then this is column to the middle. And this is actually column three on the right hand side.

702
01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:42.840
Karen Fireman: They don't start with zero, they start with one

703
01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:45.210
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah, they do. That's that goes

704
01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:47.370
Capstone Coach 1: That goes back to TK

705
01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:49.830
Karen Fireman: Really

706
01:30:50.190 --> 01:30:59.370
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah so TK is so old and see that, you know, once that once upon a time, all the loop started with one. Let's see her. Oh, this is old.

707
01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:04.830
Capstone Coach 1: Oh, so there is a there is a column zero but columns here was off the canvas, I believe.

708
01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:06.120
Clay Coleman: Dr. Jones.

709
01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:10.500
Capstone Coach 1: Columns here refers to the just the canvas. So, yes, sir.

710
01:31:10.830 --> 01:31:14.430
Clay Coleman: Dr. Jones, if you go down to your function that gets the stock price.

711
01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:16.350
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah.

712
01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:22.950
Clay Coleman: And the if you put in self dot symbol get and the function get

713
01:31:24.450 --> 01:31:25.710
Capstone Coach 1: You're talking about down here.

714
01:31:26.190 --> 01:31:31.770
Clay Coleman: Yes, sir. Type in so symbol dot get open, close parentheses.

715
01:31:33.330 --> 01:31:33.720
Capstone Coach 1: Where

716
01:31:34.710 --> 01:31:39.900
Clay Coleman: You can do it on. So where you're doing your print self dot symbol.

717
01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:43.230
Clay Coleman: Yeah dot get OPEN, CLOSED PARENTHESES

718
01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:46.650
Capstone Coach 1: Like that.

719
01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:47.400
Clay Coleman: Yes, sir.

720
01:31:49.530 --> 01:31:50.040
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

721
01:31:51.570 --> 01:31:53.250
Capstone Coach 1: should shut the sky down

722
01:31:56.460 --> 01:32:03.690
Capstone Coach 1: Oh yeah, that was another. That was a boo boo shit or restarted the Colonel.

723
01:32:06.810 --> 01:32:19.620
Capstone Coach 1: Because of this, this multi threading thing you can get in a situation where your spider locks up on you and what you do is go up here under console and restart the Colonel. If that happens,

724
01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:29.490
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so I'm going to run it right now and won't. Okay, there we go. And so I'm going to put it on the IBM thing here, right.

725
01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:35.100
Capstone Coach 1: Like that, sir, and okay now what

726
01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:37.800
Capstone Coach 1: It says, IBM, yeah.

727
01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:48.600
Clay Coleman: Yeah. So now you can pull. So you just pass that in online 57 instead of symbol just your symbol, get the function. And now you can build your URL.

728
01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:54.600
Capstone Coach 1: Before I go that far. I want to go back and look at what's going on up here.

729
01:32:56.190 --> 01:32:56.760
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

730
01:32:57.930 --> 01:33:03.330
Capstone Coach 1: Maybe that's that's the right thing to do. I don't know, but I don't. I didn't know. That's a surprise.

731
01:33:05.850 --> 01:33:17.100
Capstone Coach 1: So let's take a look at the dollars thing here. Take a look at this. So this guy right here is the box, it creates the box.

732
01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:26.220
Capstone Coach 1: And that's one of the symbol, but get is working is because inside that box. It's getting the string that's coming out of that box right

733
01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:31.950
Capstone Coach 1: Great. Yeah. So what I wanted to do is use this guy right

734
01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:35.010
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, no.

735
01:33:36.270 --> 01:33:39.270
Capstone Coach 1: This is, this is the price that's going to be written

736
01:33:41.730 --> 01:33:46.200
Capstone Coach 1: To. So let's change self dot dollars to

737
01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:53.310
Capstone Coach 1: Say see price.

738
01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:00.240
Capstone Coach 1: And self dot dollars to see price.

739
01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:04.230
Capstone Coach 1: closing price.

740
01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:08.610
Capstone Coach 1: Close.

741
01:34:11.970 --> 01:34:12.540
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

742
01:34:17.010 --> 01:34:17.610
Capstone Coach 1: So,

743
01:34:20.100 --> 01:34:32.700
Capstone Coach 1: All right, let's see what happens if we take your approach down here. So down here instead of saying self symbol, we would just you're saying we should just say something about yet like that.

744
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:34.170
Capstone Coach 1: Right.

745
01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:35.130
Clay Coleman: Yes, sir.

746
01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:35.940
Okay.

747
01:34:45.390 --> 01:34:48.930
Capstone Coach 1: Just curious. Okay, now we're going to run this and see what happens.

748
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:08.250
Brian Frankel: Price should be lowercase.

749
01:35:13.230 --> 01:35:17.340
Capstone Coach 1: You mean. Okay, so I'm going to kill a guy you me right here.

750
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:20.100
Yes, a good

751
01:35:23.610 --> 01:35:24.090
Capstone Coach 1: Day.

752
01:35:25.170 --> 01:35:25.710
Capstone Coach 1: We get

753
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:30.810
Capstone Coach 1: Who's helping me right away. I can't see you talking so I

754
01:35:32.850 --> 01:35:33.780
Karen Fireman: Sounded like Brian

755
01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:37.080
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, let's see.

756
01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:39.930
Capstone Coach 1: Over here.

757
01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:45.060
Capstone Coach 1: Symbol IBM like that price.

758
01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:56.760
Capstone Coach 1: Bang Bang. Okay, so it's not showing up the actual price is not showing up in the in the gooey, but we've got at least we are it's running. And it doesn't have any errors.

759
01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:01.230
Capstone Coach 1: So that's cool.

760
01:36:02.670 --> 01:36:02.940
Karen Fireman: Can you

761
01:36:03.990 --> 01:36:04.380
Karen Fireman: Maybe

762
01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:06.600
Capstone Coach 1: We're making progress.

763
01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:10.380
Karen Fireman: Can you scroll down for a little bit for a second, sir, down to the bottom.

764
01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:11.460
Capstone Coach 1: Of the code.

765
01:36:11.730 --> 01:36:13.200
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah yeah like down here.

766
01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:25.440
Karen Fireman: Um yeah cuz I'm having trouble with my gooey. Um, it's saying that it doesn't have the same stock wait object has no attribute stock close, but I don't see where

767
01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:27.870
Karen Fireman: I need stuck close

768
01:36:29.850 --> 01:36:31.770
Capstone Coach 1: Aware in my code. Are you talking about

769
01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:36.300
Karen Fireman: I thought it was at the end line 85 but it isn't there either.

770
01:36:42.210 --> 01:36:51.600
Karen Fireman: I'm getting up, it says my view equals and then it's it's hanging up and says that stock QE object has no attribute stock close

771
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:54.360
Capstone Coach 1: Yo,

772
01:36:55.860 --> 01:37:01.470
Capstone Coach 1: Yo, on the original so example three there was nothing after that line my gooey except route.

773
01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:04.800
Capstone Coach 1: So,

774
01:37:06.630 --> 01:37:07.650
Capstone Coach 1: Going back here.

775
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:14.610
Capstone Coach 1: I'm not sure why you would be getting an error, right in this area, unless there's something else up here that's

776
01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:17.370
Capstone Coach 1: going wrong. So

777
01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:20.970
Karen Fireman: It's, it's not even. Yeah, it's not even executing

778
01:37:21.630 --> 01:37:22.800
Capstone Coach 1: Oh, it's not executing

779
01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:24.360
Karen Fireman: Right. It's having that problem.

780
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:26.400
Capstone Coach 1: What problem.

781
01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:29.940
Karen Fireman: Stock up object has no attributes stock.

782
01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:32.040
Capstone Coach 1: Close. Okay.

783
01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:34.200
Karen Fireman: Here we defined it on 52 or

784
01:37:34.770 --> 01:37:39.900
Capstone Coach 1: Up top there. What is saying what it's saying is the variable stock closes, not to find your code.

785
01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:42.180
Capstone Coach 1: So let's go back.

786
01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:45.630
Karen Fireman: Maybe I didn't type it right. I had a capital in there. Oh.

787
01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:47.340
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, yeah.

788
01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:49.590
Karen Fireman: What it's doing. Okay, thank you.

789
01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:50.340
Capstone Coach 1: Mm hmm.

790
01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:51.840
Karen Fireman: That's it. Thank you. So

791
01:37:53.820 --> 01:37:56.760
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so let's see what what's happening here.

792
01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:09.360
Capstone Coach 1: In this particular version, we've we've looks like we've, we've got the symbol going in correct into the code correctly. So down here we're using symbol get

793
01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:14.730
Capstone Coach 1: The API key and then we're using this now.

794
01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:20.280
Capstone Coach 1: What I don't see here though what I needed to print out is

795
01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:31.140
Capstone Coach 1: Going to reach that Prince front line right there and right here before we close return. Let's print

796
01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:33.330
Capstone Coach 1: The result.

797
01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:35.880
Capstone Coach 1: And

798
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:40.080
Capstone Coach 1: Let's press the close price.

799
01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:43.080
Capstone Coach 1: Like that.

800
01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:50.820
Capstone Coach 1: Okay. That wasn't me. No, not me.

801
01:38:52.590 --> 01:38:55.920
Capstone Coach 1: All right. Let's see what we got here. Um,

802
01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:02.130
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, that

803
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:05.370
Capstone Coach 1: Come over here with IBM again.

804
01:39:07.950 --> 01:39:20.010
Capstone Coach 1: And boom, okay. So yes, it's actually getting there. If you look at the output that's being printed out. It's good. Getting 130 dot 08

805
01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:24.750
Capstone Coach 1: As the correct number there. So the

806
01:39:26.850 --> 01:39:37.740
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah, so this is working correctly, this, this function stock close it's working correctly. So we're going to get rid of those print statements we know it's working right.

807
01:39:38.910 --> 01:39:43.950
Capstone Coach 1: And so that means that our problem is up here in our, in our code. Let's see what we've got.

808
01:39:46.710 --> 01:39:52.680
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so what happens is that when we asked for the price.

809
01:39:55.470 --> 01:39:57.180
Capstone Coach 1: We get the right price.

810
01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:01.410
Capstone Coach 1: But it's not showing up inside the gooey right here. Right.

811
01:40:02.850 --> 01:40:11.520
Capstone Coach 1: So let's see, this would be column two row two. So that would be this thing here which says, See price.

812
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:16.380
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

813
01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:34.380
Capstone Coach 1: And all of this information is being correctly done correctly. So what's happening here is

814
01:40:35.850 --> 01:40:40.470
Capstone Coach 1: This guy right here that we commented out on he didn't comment if like that.

815
01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:42.750
Capstone Coach 1: And

816
01:40:47.550 --> 01:40:49.470
Karen Fireman: Then, sir, we got rid of that convert

817
01:40:50.130 --> 01:40:51.330
Capstone Coach 1: I know we did, yeah.

818
01:40:53.100 --> 01:41:00.390
Capstone Coach 1: The convert. Let me take a look at that. Go back to this example three the Convert was

819
01:41:05.490 --> 01:41:06.120
Capstone Coach 1: Right here.

820
01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:08.970
Capstone Coach 1: So,

821
01:41:10.410 --> 01:41:16.290
Capstone Coach 1: What we're doing is we're calculating the dollars and then we're using the set command.

822
01:41:17.580 --> 01:41:22.650
Capstone Coach 1: To put self dot dollars set and then the USD right there.

823
01:41:23.700 --> 01:41:26.790
Capstone Coach 1: So what I need to do is

824
01:41:29.130 --> 01:41:33.000
Capstone Coach 1: Use the set command for the closing price.

825
01:41:34.500 --> 01:41:37.230
Capstone Coach 1: Let's go back to here.

826
01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:42.840
Capstone Coach 1: And so I think what we need to. I'm going to put. I'm going to put it right in here.

827
01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:45.480
Capstone Coach 1: And

828
01:41:48.030 --> 01:41:49.920
Capstone Coach 1: What I'm going to do is say,

829
01:41:51.630 --> 01:41:53.700
Capstone Coach 1: The button. There it is. This guy right here.

830
01:41:57.570 --> 01:41:58.740
Capstone Coach 1: Let's see, set

831
01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:03.210
Capstone Coach 1: See price.

832
01:42:15.570 --> 01:42:15.930
Capstone Coach 1: Right.

833
01:43:05.610 --> 01:43:14.940
Capstone Coach 1: Anyway, yeah. The problem is down here at the bottom, it's, it's a little pastor 830 so I'll go ahead and close this down and

834
01:43:16.170 --> 01:43:18.180
Capstone Coach 1: I'm going to continue to work on this and

835
01:43:19.590 --> 01:43:20.070
Capstone Coach 1: If you

836
01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:29.610
Capstone Coach 1: Have any ideas about how to do this and let me know. But I should be able to figure it out here pretty quickly. I just don't want to keep everybody online so

837
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:38.340
Karen Fireman: Question sir, what is that actually that convert the part that the Convert was doing that you're now trying to do with the

838
01:43:38.490 --> 01:43:44.070
Capstone Coach 1: Color coded to convert took the rate the exchange rate and then turn to then $2 or pesos.

839
01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:45.330
Karen Fireman: Right.

840
01:43:45.390 --> 01:43:47.310
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, so we're not having to we don't have

841
01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:53.430
Capstone Coach 1: The staff here we're just printed out that one. So what I want to do is put the

842
01:43:55.710 --> 01:43:59.820
Capstone Coach 1: The closing price in that box in the if you look at the gooey.

843
01:44:01.020 --> 01:44:05.430
Capstone Coach 1: Right here, which is column to row to I want to put the closing price right in here.

844
01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:08.550
Capstone Coach 1: When I click on price.

845
01:44:09.150 --> 01:44:11.490
Capstone Coach 1: Right here, this should be the closing price. Right.

846
01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:16.620
Karen Fireman: And then that mainframe find what what does that mean being pregnant. Fine.

847
01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:30.150
Capstone Coach 1: I'm not sure, actually, that's what. That's the trouble. I'm having I don't have a documentation on this. And so I've have. I have a mind to just actually

848
01:44:35.310 --> 01:44:37.200
Capstone Coach 1: Get rid of this part right here.

849
01:44:38.700 --> 01:44:42.210
Capstone Coach 1: And also this part right down here. I'm going to comment those out.

850
01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:45.420
Capstone Coach 1: Because I don't think they're needed here.

851
01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:02.490
Capstone Coach 1: We have to take a look up here where it says bottom and label see price and the symbol.

852
01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:08.400
Capstone Coach 1: Hang on the manager, I gotta go back go back and check this out. So this is

853
01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:13.470
Capstone Coach 1: Symbol. Where's the button. This is

854
01:45:15.330 --> 01:45:20.130
Capstone Coach 1: The button and the command is go to close close

855
01:45:21.420 --> 01:45:25.950
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, and what closed does spot close

856
01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:33.990
Capstone Coach 1: It returns. The reason for the return is because previously. I had to go through that version.

857
01:45:35.010 --> 01:45:37.800
Capstone Coach 1: And so it says Show conversion here.

858
01:45:42.450 --> 01:45:43.230
Capstone Coach 1: I'll leave it there.

859
01:45:45.390 --> 01:46:02.550
Capstone Coach 1: So previously, I had to get the rate and then turn it into dollars or pesos. And that's why it's, there's a return here, but that's not necessary now. So all we need to do is take off that return like that and just say,

860
01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:04.920
Capstone Coach 1: Self.

861
01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:11.670
Capstone Coach 1: Dot close price and also self dot result right here.

862
01:46:14.490 --> 01:46:20.340
Capstone Coach 1: And those are automatically going to become then known to the class itself. You don't have to return it.

863
01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:37.380
Capstone Coach 1: Now it says close price here so I'll have to use the same terminology up here. And so it says a symbol entry focus. What this does is it says whatever is a symbol entries show it in the gooey.

864
01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:42.390
Capstone Coach 1: And so what I need to do is change civil entering

865
01:46:47.610 --> 01:46:48.030
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

866
01:46:53.610 --> 01:46:56.670
Capstone Coach 1: Now this is see price right here. So string variable.

867
01:46:57.720 --> 01:46:58.710
Capstone Coach 1: So,

868
01:46:59.730 --> 01:47:00.540
Capstone Coach 1: Instead of

869
01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:02.370
Karen Fireman: Yeah. Can you go back there.

870
01:47:06.690 --> 01:47:11.100
Capstone Coach 1: So instead of see price here. I should say close price.

871
01:47:15.210 --> 01:47:18.780
Capstone Coach 1: And text variable close price.

872
01:47:20.250 --> 01:47:20.820
Capstone Coach 1: Like that.

873
01:47:22.410 --> 01:47:27.180
Capstone Coach 1: So this initially it sets close price to a blank, which is string variable.

874
01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:46.380
Capstone Coach 1: And then it shows the, you know, it creates that part of the gooey column to row to right there, but it's empty. So you don't see anything. But as soon as I put something into it right down here. Close prices equal to, it should then show. Let's run it and see if that works.

875
01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:53.340
Capstone Coach 1: So I'm going to close this instance right now and rerun it.

876
01:47:55.380 --> 01:48:03.000
Capstone Coach 1: Hello. Okay, there we go. Coming up, and so I'm going to type in IBM and hit price.

877
01:48:04.830 --> 01:48:05.460
Capstone Coach 1: And

878
01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:09.600
Capstone Coach 1: Result is not defined. Okay, so it's

879
01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:15.300
Capstone Coach 1: Complaining about another problem result great not there.

880
01:48:22.110 --> 01:48:23.100
Capstone Coach 1: It's up here.

881
01:48:29.310 --> 01:48:33.840
Capstone Coach 1: Worse it what's line 63

882
01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:37.650
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, come down.

883
01:48:41.130 --> 01:48:43.380
Capstone Coach 1: Oh result is not defined right here.

884
01:48:45.390 --> 01:48:46.920
Capstone Coach 1: I need to say self.

885
01:48:47.970 --> 01:48:49.170
Capstone Coach 1: Dot resolved.

886
01:48:50.610 --> 01:49:04.560
Capstone Coach 1: Like that right in there because I put instead of putting result here I put self taught resolve, which is the class name and result is a global variable which is so that was really not a good thing to do and

887
01:49:07.650 --> 01:49:08.280
Capstone Coach 1: All right.

888
01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:15.300
Capstone Coach 1: All right. Let's run it again. I think I'm going to, I think I need to clear the research, but the

889
01:49:17.010 --> 01:49:18.450
Capstone Coach 1: Colonel doing now.

890
01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:23.490
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

891
01:49:25.530 --> 01:49:26.430
Capstone Coach 1: And

892
01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:28.170
Capstone Coach 1: Can we go

893
01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:35.040
Capstone Coach 1: Like

894
01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:41.370
Capstone Coach 1: Nothing happened.

895
01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:46.080
Capstone Coach 1: Okay.

896
01:49:50.250 --> 01:49:52.230
Capstone Coach 1: Nothing happened at all.

897
01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:04.470
Capstone Coach 1: Symbol entry focus it should have

898
01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:08.970
Capstone Coach 1: Simple entry.

899
01:50:10.260 --> 01:50:10.740
Capstone Coach 1: Oh,

900
01:50:13.620 --> 01:50:14.190
Capstone Coach 1: I didn't

901
01:50:20.610 --> 01:50:21.870
Capstone Coach 1: Close price.

902
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:25.320
Capstone Coach 1: Close price.

903
01:50:27.810 --> 01:50:28.620
Capstone Coach 1: Focus.

904
01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:56.760
Capstone Coach 1: So,

905
01:51:19.260 --> 01:51:21.540
Wilson Pineda: Okay, you want to review it offline and then we

906
01:51:21.540 --> 01:51:28.620
Capstone Coach 1: Yeah, I think I better look at this offline and skidding I got I've gotten confusion in here. Major confusion. But we're close.

907
01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:46.560
Capstone Coach 1: All we have to do is figure out why the price is not displaying at that label point and I think we can Google one on one approaches to Google. The documentation to find out for a TIKI TIKI enter. So if you, you know, if you go to Google to enter

908
01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:48.810
Capstone Coach 1: Display

909
01:51:50.190 --> 01:51:50.760
Capstone Coach 1: String

910
01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:53.700
Capstone Coach 1: And

911
01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:59.730
Capstone Coach 1: That should do it. You know, she gives, gives us an example to work from. Okay.

912
01:52:02.940 --> 01:52:12.660
Capstone Coach 1: All right, and I'll post some information online or in the kappa somewhere. If I figure it out. Somebody else figures it out, let me know.

913
01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:16.500
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, well,

914
01:52:17.070 --> 01:52:17.640
Karen Fireman: Thank you, sir.

915
01:52:17.670 --> 01:52:19.110
Capstone Coach 1: Thank you very much. Okay.

916
01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:21.690
Capstone Coach 1: Bye bye.

917
01:52:22.110 --> 01:52:22.470
Shadi Kilani: Thank you.

918
01:52:23.250 --> 01:52:24.030
Brian Frankel: Thank you professor
