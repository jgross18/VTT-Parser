00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.180
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, Monica can you hear me.

2
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.560
Monica A. Harwig: I can yeah.

3
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.460
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, good good I wasn't sure whether I was connected or not.

4
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.350
Monica A. Harwig: yeah.

5
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.170
Capstone Coach 1: looks like we're okay sure how you doing tonight.

6
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.570
Monica A. Harwig: i'm doing okay yeah.

7
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.200
Monica A. Harwig: Okay yeah just fed the animals and.

8
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.620
Oh.

9
00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.950
Monica A. Harwig: yeah we have three.

10
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.350
Capstone Coach 1: cats or dogs or.

11
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.750
Monica A. Harwig: Three horses and.

12
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.130
Capstone Coach 1: Horses better.

13
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.320
Monica A. Harwig: yeah we're on four acres so.

14
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.290
Capstone Coach 1: and check the robots do you live.

15
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.660
Monica A. Harwig: I live in round rock North Austin.

16
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.310
Capstone Coach 1: uh huh I knew where that is.

17
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:26.160
Capstone Coach 1: yeah my my my daughter used to ride a horse actually she had a horse when she was in high school and I always like to go out there and I don't know the smell the place.

18
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.450
Capstone Coach 1: yeah.

19
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.530
Let the horses.

20
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.320
Capstone Coach 1: You know, feed the horses.

21
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.120
Capstone Coach 1: yeah like a.

22
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:51.150
Capstone Coach 1: But I had a there was a guy out there at the ranch that, basically, he would raise baby horses, you know so he'd get them on when they were just weaned from their mothers and then he would raise them to wear that you know you could run around on the ring a little bit there so.

23
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.680
Capstone Coach 1: You sort of.

24
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.820
Capstone Coach 1: break them in, I guess, I always thought that was a good job.

25
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.000
Monica A. Harwig: Oh yeah yeah yeah That would be a good job for somebody else not me.

26
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.030
Capstone Coach 1: Well let's you gotta chop right.

27
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.620
Monica A. Harwig: yeah yeah.

28
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.150
Capstone Coach 1: or something like that.

29
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:17.280
Monica A. Harwig: yeah yeah now I got a job and i'm I mean we had I just had a horse trained and she's been riding horses, since she was six so.

30
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.990
Monica A. Harwig: She was really good at it me i'm a newbie on horses kinda.

31
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.280
Capstone Coach 1: yo yo he was teaching me some things that was really fascinating.

32
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.250
Capstone Coach 1: The way that he uses behavior their horses natural behavior to to train them.

33
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.080
Capstone Coach 1: Yes, yeah.

34
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.740
Monica A. Harwig: yeah that's the best way to do it that's how we've had our horses train.

35
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.640
Capstone Coach 1: mm hmm.

36
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.890
Capstone Coach 1: Because I always wondered, I was wondering how could such a big animal be afraid of a person.

37
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.220
Monica A. Harwig: Oh yeah.

38
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.980
Capstone Coach 1: And that says to do with their behavior right.

39
00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.930
Monica A. Harwig: yeah yeah like we are predators and they're know we're praise we're yeah we're the predator to them right because they're you know.

40
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.460
Capstone Coach 1: yeah well I think every they're feeding their mentality is everything is a predator.

41
00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:06.360
yeah.

42
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.250
Capstone Coach 1: A day he said, except for some horses.

43
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.290
Monica A. Harwig: Oh yeah.

44
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.930
Capstone Coach 1: Right few that are dangerous, he said.

45
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.440
Monica A. Harwig: Oh yeah yeah yeah i've seen him, I mean I haven't seen in real life, but I yeah definitely stay away from those horses.

46
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.550
Monica A. Harwig: yeah a quarter horse in a in a quarter horse mixture yeah to quarter horses actually so but like.

47
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:41.910
Monica A. Harwig: i'm like I said we bought this property, eight years ago and it's got born, it was like a horse property and I just got the worst is just because it was the first property I probably shouldn't got the horses, but i'm learning.

48
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.650
Capstone Coach 1: Good that's very good oh sure.

49
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.360
Monica A. Harwig: No, no.

50
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.060
Monica A. Harwig: TIM, and I think you have to obtain it 10 acres or more more than 10 acres we have only four.

51
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.770
Monica A. Harwig: yeah I would not do this again because you got to pay taxes and.

52
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:06.720
Capstone Coach 1: Well that's I thought it was the other way around, is that if you had a an acreage that you could say this agriculture, you know she got a break, but no.

53
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:21.870
Monica A. Harwig: No, you can't if you got 10 acres or more, and we actually have some some more acreage out the country, and we do definitely get it we get a tax break on that um but not here in I wouldn't do it again because no my gosh the city charges, a lot for taxes are always fighting them.

54
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:35.430
Capstone Coach 1: The well that's Texas, you know, most of our texts, what do you call it the property tax rates are very high compared to other places, some people don't know they say well we're not as high as California wrong.

55
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.230
Monica A. Harwig: Right yeah.

56
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:51.270
Capstone Coach 1: yeah they go for your rates are lower, but the thing is their assessment values or higher so they end up being about the same as we do, on average, but it's you know at least they got a $3 million home or something.

57
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.240
Monica A. Harwig: yeah yes true yeah.

58
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.580
Capstone Coach 1: Okay well good.

59
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:04.860
Capstone Coach 1: So I didn't I don't know I don't have anything really prepared tonight, except to talk about the homework, do you have any questions Monica.

60
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.710
Monica A. Harwig: And I don't have any specific questions.

61
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.480
Monica A. Harwig: Just dead.

62
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.740
and

63
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.830
Capstone Coach 1: shoddy are you there.

64
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.330
Kilani, Shadi: Yes, Sir i'm right here.

65
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.860
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, you have any questions.

66
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.920
Kilani, Shadi: um do you do, I still haven't sent you the project.

67
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:31.560
Kilani, Shadi: Okay, eight shots did you want me to kind of just send it as an email a few screenshots of description or do you want me to show you right.

68
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.930
Capstone Coach 1: now send me an email it's fine right at this point i'm not getting showered with a ton of email so.

69
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.820
Capstone Coach 1: Okay yeah you know i'm a little email sensitive when we got everybody sending me email.

70
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.440
Capstone Coach 1: You know if you're just going to set it on this one activity that's fine yeah.

71
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.780
Capstone Coach 1: that's a good way to do it.

72
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.450
Kilani, Shadi: Okay, so I have a few screenshots and a bit of a.

73
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.740
Capstone Coach 1: description oh fantastic I can't wait to see it good good.

74
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.340
Kilani, Shadi: Thank you.

75
00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.140
Capstone Coach 1: Sure Karen was here, I thought and then she disappeared.

76
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.580
Monica A. Harwig: Yes, are a couple times she's in Seattle, helping her son move.

77
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.700
Monica A. Harwig: Oh wow yeah I think she says her activities hard hard to get.

78
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.530
Capstone Coach 1: yeah I wonder if she has the vaccine yep is she okay.

79
00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.540
Monica A. Harwig: um I don't know I didn't ask her about the.

80
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.410
Capstone Coach 1: bags yeah seattle's not a good place to be if you don't see.

81
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:31.860
Capstone Coach 1: my brother lives up in Seattle well normally he's in Seattle, but right now he's in Mexico, he goes to Mexico in the winter so.

82
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.680
Capstone Coach 1: lucky guy mm hmm.

83
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:41.130
Capstone Coach 1: So the homework I just posted the homework assignment for week 12 it's the same as tweak 11.

84
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:58.920
Capstone Coach 1: Basically, which has made, which is number one is optional it's worth 100 points number two and number three it's based upon the program that I uploaded at the end of the class which is time series analysis nlp and.

85
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:14.700
Capstone Coach 1: You know it's the same sort of thing what i'm asking you to do is to run for or scenarios for different scenarios, that is to reconfigure the the network to do the time series forecast and the graph.

86
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:30.750
Capstone Coach 1: And the code should run as is, in other words, if you if you download it and hit run it should go fine it should run oh you do need to download the data there so data file, that is, on the weekend the week 12 folder.

87
00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:41.970
Capstone Coach 1: So you need to download the excel data file for the IBM xml data file and then you need to download the large program the last one I think I uploaded it.

88
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:48.900
Capstone Coach 1: And you should be able to run that program as is without modification and then what you would do is make.

89
00:07:49.800 --> 00:08:00.060
Capstone Coach 1: slight modifications to the neural network that's in there that's being used to do the forecast also play with the option optimization routine.

90
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:17.970
Capstone Coach 1: I forget which one is default whether it's Adam or at a delta I would experiment with both of those and try different Leonard learning rates, with the each one of those to see you can see a dramatic differences in the output, which she really shocked me because I was thinking well.

91
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:29.490
Capstone Coach 1: You know they're both going to perform nearly the same but it didn't turn out that way at all they're very sensitive to the learning rate, they will give you and I answer, they will run.

92
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:42.090
Capstone Coach 1: But the solution that they get you, in some cases is horrible so wanted you to see maybe experience that little bit, so the homework and probably take you 30 minutes may be.

93
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:48.300
Capstone Coach 1: And as far as what you did to upload you upload the the the the.

94
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:57.840
Capstone Coach 1: The figure of your best run so that would be a figure, the bulk of the program produces a picture of.

95
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:07.410
Capstone Coach 1: The forecasts and the actual data you saw that I think last night and so it's it's part of the output in the program this show me the best one.

96
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:20.670
Capstone Coach 1: And maybe just a little table it could be excel or it could be PDF which just says here the scenarios Iran, and these are the average squared error, the route to average score there for those scenarios, so I can see.

97
00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:28.800
Capstone Coach 1: You know which one did best for you that's all so it's just basically like week 11 maybe a little easier actually.

98
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.350
Capstone Coach 1: Any questions on that.

99
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:41.640
Monica A. Harwig: No, I don't have any questions I saw it before I came to the office hours and it looks like yeah similar very similar to last week's and I didn't have any issues with last week's homework so.

100
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:46.110
Capstone Coach 1: Okay yeah it's it's posted to send them week 12 folder.

101
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:51.720
Capstone Coach 1: So yeah if you have any questions, give me a shout send me an email.

102
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:52.830
Monica A. Harwig: Okay.

103
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.980
Capstone Coach 1: Oh so both of you finished your capstones.

104
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.120
Monica A. Harwig: i'm done.

105
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.830
Capstone Coach 1: Okay, good congratulations to you about chuck D Oh, but you are you done.

106
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.300
Kilani, Shadi: I, yes I.

107
00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:04.860
Kilani, Shadi: Think.

108
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:13.110
Capstone Coach 1: Well, congratulations, we won't be long now, before you're out of here, so to speak, I think, may 19 is the.

109
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:26.820
Capstone Coach 1: Pure presentations and then may 20 is the the graduation so that's cool we have, I think two more lectures then we're going to go into our presentations for the projects.

110
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:38.010
Capstone Coach 1: And what i'm planning to do for the next two lectures is talk about time series forecasting using charisse so we started that on yesterday and.

111
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:53.520
Capstone Coach 1: We next one will be look at the recursive neural network approach to doing time series, and then the last one would be the lstm approach, which is sort of like the recursive approach, but just use a different routine that's all.

112
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.550
Monica A. Harwig: it's like I said.

113
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:02.640
Kilani, Shadi: that's a good that's fine when you have to like tweak and manipulate and kind of see the effect and.

114
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.610
Kilani, Shadi: Then you're like what if I fly 15 he parks, but if I do.

115
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:19.800
Capstone Coach 1: play right yeah yeah that's that's a nice thing about this approach is that you can try different you know tweak it a little bit here and there, it's not really that mysterious Okay, here it is in the code.

116
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:25.020
Capstone Coach 1: Whereas when you do in the renal modeling it becomes a little bit more.

117
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:35.400
Capstone Coach 1: tricky you need to have more statistical knowledge for that, I think, so the advantage of this approach, the neural network kind of thing is that.

118
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:44.610
Capstone Coach 1: it's almost automatic you're almost you're able to just okay that looks good let's go with that that kind of thing now one of the things I don't have in the code is.

119
00:11:45.210 --> 00:12:01.050
Capstone Coach 1: A forecast for future timeframes so right now What it does is it fits the data and then forecasts, the data, but what we could have done in the in the program and maybe i'll do this for in person, it next time is.

120
00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:09.060
Capstone Coach 1: Say withhold the end of the data or the front of the data or what have you and then forecasts that part using.

121
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:16.800
Capstone Coach 1: The early you know train using one part of the data and then forecasts, the other part, and that's sort of a validation thing to see how well you're doing.

122
00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:26.820
Capstone Coach 1: And then the other thing you can do is actually extend the forecast out into the future, you know one one step behind two steps three steps.

123
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:39.630
Capstone Coach 1: In this particular date it's one week the week the timeframe is weekly so you could, for instance forecast next week forecasts two weeks from now three weeks and so forth, and so on.

124
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:53.490
Capstone Coach 1: it's not that difficult it's just requires a little extra programming all Maybe I should do that before we go to our next meeting okay well that's it that's all I had, I appreciate you guys showing up.

125
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.590
Kilani, Shadi: Thank you, I sent you the email.

126
00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:57.840
Kilani, Shadi: Do email.

127
00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:58.710
Okay.

128
00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:04.080
Capstone Coach 1: And let me see if i've got it here i'm sure that I do let's see.

129
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.630
Monica A. Harwig: Thank you, Dr Jones I appreciate it.

130
00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.390
Capstone Coach 1: Okay well appreciate thanks for showing up arnica.

131
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:10.290
Monica A. Harwig: Oh you're welcome.

132
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.060
Kilani, Shadi: bye bye.

133
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.430
Capstone Coach 1: yeah shetty I.
