00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: Welcome to

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: Python programming or we're going to be having some fun. I'll show you what I'm talking about here.

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.150
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, so

4
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.180
MS Analytics Class 2021: You should see a green stroke, they're applying this drone using my cell phone.

5
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.400
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it's fairly harmless. I mean, I can maybe go up and down with my cell phone, maybe go a

6
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.570
MS Analytics Class 2021: Little command that I wanted to

7
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.930
MS Analytics Class 2021: Turn this and this will actually also pay for your

8
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.840
MS Analytics Class 2021: Video

9
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:02.550
MS Analytics Class 2021: Pretty good air conditioning vending in this room and sucking the drone up into the ceiling anyway.

10
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: Not really. When you do have to keep

11
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: Looking around seeing the walls here.

12
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: We are a lot of students here, but their virtual

13
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: And I'm going to come forward.

14
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: Over to the board. I don't even see it on board. They are not

15
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: Actually who over crashing into the board.

16
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.470
MS Analytics Class 2021: And that all

17
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:49.590
MS Analytics Class 2021: Propeller gardens even doing any serious damage. However, you haven't connected this with your face on top of. They are those little propellers.

18
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.020
MS Analytics Class 2021: Can cause problems. So I'm going to take a little video

19
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: So let's see.

20
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.280
MS Analytics Class 2021: Photographs of the room. And now I'm going to turn on the video.

21
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: Can room.

22
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.590
MS Analytics Class 2021: So,

23
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.970
MS Analytics Class 2021: They get a little 360 video was here and you see me there.

24
00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: All right.

25
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:21.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: And the reason I started with that is because one of the lectures are written in heaven, about four weeks. It's going to be on programming using pipe out to pro program these one pilot that anonymous vehicles and this is what we're going to use for this will tell

26
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:34.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: You, there's some information that the only works with site on why one of these. If you want want, but in about four weeks for wanting to learn a program that right. They are displaying taking the photographs and everything using

27
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: Using my cell phones.

28
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.010
Wish. They all came to play with it.

29
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.260
They said, This is the coolest zoom meeting. I've ever been in.

30
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: A Dr. Jones Jones. Can you hear me.

31
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.060
Yes.

32
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: Class.

33
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.480
Interpreters

34
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:45.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: Smaller about the size of the greatest fan. Okay, let's take a look and see what's on our syllabus. If you go to the campus, you're going to find that I copy and sell this and we'll go over that first order.

35
00:04:47.370 --> 00:05:01.140
MS Analytics Class 2021: There is. Okay. So this is pretty much the standard thing where we're going to be doing this every Tuesday night for two hours, six to three hours after about six to nine.

36
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:20.910
MS Analytics Class 2021: We're going to have office hours before class. And those of you that are in Houston, and then we'll have them on Wednesday evening from seven o'clock to 830 they will be recorded and posted on the campus if you're unable to make that time.

37
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:34.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: The focus for the office hours, usually on Wednesday will be the homework assignment and questions that might come up about the class or the lecture last Tuesday.

38
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.250
MS Analytics Class 2021: If you attended the the summer class. I think most of you.

39
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:49.110
MS Analytics Class 2021: You know what I normally do is assign homework every class and then had to do before the following class and we're going to use that model again here.

40
00:05:50.070 --> 00:06:04.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: However, there's something that we're not going to do in the sun. We had several examinations of you were. We have no exams in this class. Not everything is based upon homework.

41
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:17.550
MS Analytics Class 2021: And on a semester project which will be like a super homework problem. Okay, well you're choosing now please complete the course. I'd like you to be

42
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: More provision by on the currently are. Now some of you probably already

43
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:31.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: Are more efficient than I can, if you're working in a position where you're using by every day, then they're probably very, very efficient.

44
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:44.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: But this cool discourse is made for for you, but it's primarily for people that wanted to aren't there yet. And they won't learn more about Python and

45
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:54.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: In particular, we're going to be looking at. We're going to start off by looking at some of the basic libraries that are in Python.

46
00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:05.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: That would be not being Candace and Matt live Matt plot line, which we'll talk about it. See what happens. We'll talk about today and we're going to also then be writing

47
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:17.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: Applications for other devices like homes and we're going and other computers will see some of that tonight.

48
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: We're going to be using the be where and there's a that's a library and then another library called Tinker TK I NT er.

49
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:38.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: And these are used for making applications that can run and the benefit of Python on different machines and you'll see some of that here tonight, see why that's a good thing.

50
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:55.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: Will also be looking at the P white torch and TensorFlow and carrots for deep learning. And so about the first half of the class will talk about some of the things that we didn't do in the center which is some of the plots.

51
00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: How instead of doing and doing and why don't you why you'd want to do that.

52
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:12.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then we'll get into deep learning the for the last half of the class. And that would be that's flowing Charisse primarily and then Tiki Room will be looking at things like vision recognition.

53
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:33.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: Language recognition Tennyson voice using terrorists and TensorFlow. We're also going to be looking at programming using Python program unmanned vehicles are violent vehicles. So, that can be a car to be a truck or in this case is to be a drone.

54
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:42.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: It's a little hard to get a car or truck in your program that but we can program a little drum to fly around and then we use it.

55
00:08:43.830 --> 00:09:03.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: And you'll see how that's done. Now why that's being done is because the principles and the basic process to use the program that little drone is still is similar to, to what you would do if you're going to program car or a truck or an airplane or something like that. So,

56
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.530
MS Analytics Class 2021: The this ability to program on

57
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:22.830
MS Analytics Class 2021: Vehicles is rapidly taking off and Sunday, you'll probably see cars driving down the street with no money in them. Maybe an Amazon thing. I'm the silence busy, don't bother you, because

58
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:31.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: You'll also see leaving and I see drones delivering packages and food and things like that in the near future.

59
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:43.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: This last December of the FAA who regulates all airspace in the United States without a new set of rules that covers

60
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:51.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then apply the bottom and vehicle son pilot and big and Sam is basically necessary in design so that

61
00:09:52.620 --> 00:10:00.480
MS Analytics Class 2021: The day when the day comes that you have thousands of these things running around delivering things or communicating in the subway.

62
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:10.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: You know, often run into each other are causing problems. And so they have a new set of rules that are coming out that will help manage

63
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:21.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: The when they go low airspace everything below 400 feet, basically. So, the United States and Canada. Your, a lot of the fire it up about 400 feet as long as you're on airport

64
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:32.370
MS Analytics Class 2021: Over people regards or international particles are all prohibitions. So you can do still quite a flying one of those things.

65
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:48.300
MS Analytics Class 2021: So that's sort of our focus to prepare episodes of course is an interesting learning on program. We do have one ball and that's all panelists are everyone

66
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:57.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: And I think it's a good book, we're going, we're going to take a look at the first three chapters tonight and go from there.

67
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:14.160
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you asked me to do semester project that we 60% of your grade homework will be in another 40% know exams. No need for blockers or anything like that.

68
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:18.600
MS Analytics Class 2021: The semester project is

69
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:33.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: Your choosing, you're going to be your big VR ops to find something that you want to do with Python and develop an application around whatever that is. And

70
00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:47.730
MS Analytics Class 2021: I think it would work best if you have a partner. So I'm thinking that the semester project would be done with teams of two or three people, something of that time.

71
00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:59.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: Some people that are very, very good at icon or they like to get it the deals and details on they should probably be on your team and then

72
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:09.660
MS Analytics Class 2021: Others that might like documentation and research and things like that might be on the team as well to go to a three person team wouldn't have

73
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:18.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: Programming expert somebody who's good at the documentation research at somebody good organization, bring it all together.

74
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:31.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: And the idea behind the project now is that at the end of the semester. The last two sessions. We're going to have each do the presentation and you'll have a short amount of time to do that.

75
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:43.830
MS Analytics Class 2021: And low score in your presentation, based on that asked questions and things of that time. So that's our greatest on is pretty fairly informal really

76
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.270
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let's see. Okay.

77
00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:51.780
MS Analytics Class 2021: The rest of this. I think you know about

78
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.370
MS Analytics Class 2021: Please read this. You have any questions, let me know.

79
00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: I think you've seen versions of this every semester every class.

80
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:13.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: And the deal with plagiarism and things of that time. Now this is a new one tennis at all sessions is mandatory. Oh, why, and I'll see anybody

81
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:32.640
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, well, you don't have misinterpreted. Right. So, we want you to participate in class, if at all possible, but it's not always possible. And so these are all recorded. They're all online. And that's always an option for me.

82
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:59.400
MS Analytics Class 2021: Made up. Well, there's nothing to make up except possibly the old and I'm not going to access usual I am going not going to allow or be turned in late reason is at the beginning of the class all over the solution. The homework, whatever that is. Are we okay okay

83
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:19.140
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then of course there's this notice about recording sessions are being recorded, and I think hobby. Oh, I got it. You want to say something about masks. Okay.

84
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:24.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is where it's at. So he has an official announcement.

85
00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.780
MS Analytics Class 2021: We have a report.

86
00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:43.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah okay everybody just one quick announcement welcome last semester for you all. So this is just primarily for the people that are coming to city center.

87
00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:54.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: We're just reminding everybody that masks need to be on at all times. Unless you're eating in the dining home. If not, and if you happen to be inside the building, even though

88
00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:04.140
MS Analytics Class 2021: Even in the breakout rooms rose, whether you're by yourself or locked in. If you're not eating in the dining hall last speech to be on all the way

89
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:17.280
MS Analytics Class 2021: So no one covered noses know anything, I'll make sure everybody feels safe coming into the space and we want to keep it that way. So just a reminder that if you're thinking of coming to citizen respect social distancing

90
00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:28.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: Guidelines masks on at all times, no food or drink inside the classroom. Any question, just let us let us know y'all have a wonderful semester.

91
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:31.500
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

92
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:34.800
Right.

93
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:47.880
MS Analytics Class 2021: Personal Elon Elon this in quarantine you know that you know what that's about. So I think everybody knows what that's about. Let's talk about the the course schedule.

94
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:58.170
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, this, this version doesn't have an honor the though the version that I put up

95
00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:02.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: Online, which I think is this version.

96
00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:08.550
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah.

97
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:24.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: On the campus on this version at the last page, it shows you week by week. What are we doing, and tonight we're looking at canvas math Bloodline and to Tender, tender.

98
00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:33.480
MS Analytics Class 2021: That's part one of the book, by the way. So your homework assignment is to read the part one of the book, which is the first three chapters.

99
00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:54.540
MS Analytics Class 2021: And the assignment for week one will be due next week check over the 26 so if you want to find out whether an assignment is super a particular date like March 30th, we're in, for example, you will see the week 10 assignment is to march 30

100
00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:14.160
MS Analytics Class 2021: There is some peculiar things about the schedule. Number one, how did we get so lucky march. The second is Texas in Venice day with falls on the to see which means we have no class no class on March the set

101
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:20.310
MS Analytics Class 2021: And no class but no assignment for me.

102
00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:25.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you're going to have a you have a bullet all their week so amazingly

103
00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:30.930
MS Analytics Class 2021: Also on March the

104
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:53.880
MS Analytics Class 2021: Know, February, the second which is the third week is coming up pretty soon we're going to start. One hour later said so starting in six. We're starting at seven o'clock. And the reason for that is, there's a scheduling conflict that requires us to start. One hour later, this is on exams.

105
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:55.860
MS Analytics Class 2021: And

106
00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:03.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: All the scheduling all the informations. There are so often drop that down.

107
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.070
MS Analytics Class 2021: And let's go out to eat, cabbage, I can

108
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:13.680
MS Analytics Class 2021: There we go.

109
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:19.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: Well, I was on the canvas is this

110
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:25.860
MS Analytics Class 2021: Oh, there it is. Okay.

111
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:35.340
MS Analytics Class 2021: So if you would follow along with me here at Kansas City going on and open that up.

112
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:51.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: Alright, so here we are, our syllabus and then if you scroll down on where it says textbook.

113
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: Textbook

114
00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:01.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: You're going to see them all the data files that are using the text phone are available here online and e commerce.

115
00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:14.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: And there are two versions. There's some data zip file data set, which you can download to your computer and it will then give you all of the data files that are being used in the book.

116
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:24.180
MS Analytics Class 2021: If you want both just walk them down or two of them down for leisure. It's easier to go over here where it says panelists are everyone open data.

117
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:45.840
MS Analytics Class 2021: And you'll see tonight we're going to be using the first to make sense one goal. Yeah. Minor TSP. The second one of all sizes dot csv. So these are the two data sets that are being used in the first three chapters of the book and will we take a look at the time as well.

118
00:19:47.580 --> 00:20:00.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: All right. If we don't bother. You'll see it says we want and we open up week one. And there are a couple of things in here that will be well we'll be looking at all this but

119
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:06.450
MS Analytics Class 2021: There is some information on to center which will be lucky and tonight.

120
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:10.890
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is a special package that goes with every

121
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:21.570
MS Analytics Class 2021: Version of Python, you don't have to install it, it's automatically included. This is the package that allows you to build a an application.

122
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.890
MS Analytics Class 2021: That will run on one side.

123
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:33.180
MS Analytics Class 2021: So not just windows and Max, but also cell phones.

124
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:50.130
MS Analytics Class 2021: And Linux and all sorts of executing why us, then we want to sign on this year posted and then the upload for the week one assignment, as usual, which will do is they open up the assignment and you'll see it here. This center.

125
00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: So this is a description of the Week one assignment.

126
00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.350
MS Analytics Class 2021: And can slow

127
00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:07.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: Right.

128
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:21.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: So what it's saying you're not one review the information on teleprompter. We'll talk about that and then read chapters one through three

129
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: Study the code that we're going to discuss on to enter

130
00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:37.680
MS Analytics Class 2021: Opinion personally bi. Well, this is we'll talk about this. And then you're going to be basically develop something a new app.

131
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:58.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: I new app for display the symbol of any Sunday, the current prices stop and such as IBM or what have you. If you're somebody that looks at the site market on a regular basis, you'll be familiar with this, what we're going to be doing that.

132
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.530
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

133
00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:29.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now, basically, what would your words you're asked to do in your assignment is to upload the code for your app and to screen sweet sauce one when the app comes up on your street. And there's another one. After you've actually use. Yeah.

134
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.790
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you uploaded a simple file on for the first week's assignment.

135
00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:48.390
MS Analytics Class 2021: Of course, the class that user or online here and he campus and then the Q AMP. A recordings that we do on Wednesday night will also be online.

136
00:22:49.650 --> 00:23:09.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: You're great information was was of courses here to be maintain very simple this time because I think we have a total of 12 homework assignments love our 12 and then just the special projects. And so it was a 6040 waiting on those items.

137
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:11.550
Okay.

138
00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:21.600
MS Analytics Class 2021: Those of you that know me know that I can't hear very well. And that problem has gotten worse so

139
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:34.320
MS Analytics Class 2021: Please help me here. If you have a question, what I like to do is to type it up on the chat line I'm looking at the chat line right now.

140
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:50.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: And a lot of it is just information between students, but if you have a question, I appreciate it if you type it in, or say I have a question. I talk to you or something like that. And then we'll communicate

141
00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:52.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

142
00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let's get started.

143
00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:02.850
MS Analytics Class 2021: First thing we're gonna do is talk about the struggle and opening this up.

144
00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:12.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: Again, I don't use offline is called a towel Chrome, some of you are probably more familiar with drones and I

145
00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:25.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: And some of you. This is a major law preoccupation with some people is flying drones have all sorts in the recreational area you have

146
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:38.160
MS Analytics Class 2021: Two or three major categories of use of drones. One is photography and so you like that little drone. You can take it out. You can make a video.

147
00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:50.010
MS Analytics Class 2021: You can take photographs and it's so small you can travel with it. So if you're on vacation. You can put it in your luggage and then you can use it when you get to wherever you're going to go

148
00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:57.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: The other use of the other occupations drones is racing.

149
00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:09.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: And that's all we do. So people have some small groups like the one you saw, and they wear goggles and they can see what the drone sees

150
00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:20.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: And they fly very, very fast through very, very tight areas often indoors. So they will race in the warehouse or something like that.

151
00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:33.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: And use it all have maybe a half a dozen or dozen drones that are racing. This is an entirely different thing or not doing interested in the pictures but they aren't citizen going fast.

152
00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:35.520
MS Analytics Class 2021: Through a

153
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:38.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: Lot of options.

154
00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:44.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now the strong they tell a grown up, get more information.

155
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:53.760
MS Analytics Class 2021: At the company's website. The company is called the J. Dr. Julian indio.com

156
00:25:55.710 --> 00:26:07.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: They have a good website online, they have, believe it or not, DJI has about 80% 80% of the drones that are sold in the United States come from worldwide.

157
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:20.070
MS Analytics Class 2021: Come from DJ. So there are major producer and marketing, you can get a 10% educational discount center dollar soon so

158
00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:34.140
MS Analytics Class 2021: You have seven, the little email, there's information. I've got a link right here, this little link you would put there and it'll take you over and you can send them a little email said like that educational discount

159
00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:48.840
MS Analytics Class 2021: And what they do is they send you to coupon. They've got six months to use them, that can be used for almost anything they sell. And so if you're interested in purchasing a drone, then you can save some money on that.

160
00:26:50.340 --> 00:27:03.930
MS Analytics Class 2021: This little drone is not that expensive they have actually two different versions of this little drone. They have one ball. Hello, and another one called tell you

161
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:20.250
MS Analytics Class 2021: The difference is the tableau is cheaper. It's $99 and the telco edu is $149. Now why are they, how are they different the total drone uses the

162
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:34.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: What's called a software development kit 1.3 and the telling me to you. Drone uses the SDK 2.0 so he was a newer version of drone.

163
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:49.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: And you can program, some things on the view that you cannot program on the regular tell that most of the exercises that we're going to be doing. You can use the smaller than the older one the tele drone.

164
00:27:50.190 --> 00:28:05.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: But if you want to do some of the fancy stuff you need to use the EU by fancy. I mean, we're going to be the template. Both of these drones will do simple things like you can run program.

165
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:15.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it'll go an eagle fly off to where you were resolved to fly off to go back and land on that play without you lifting a pencil or anything like that.

166
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:29.940
MS Analytics Class 2021: It's going to involve computer directed. How does that happen. Well, the drone is actually broadcasts and the internet connection. So the drone is on the internet frequency so Wi Fi frequency

167
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:51.120
MS Analytics Class 2021: So your phone or the controller, it sees the drawer computers sees the drum is an internet connection. So what happens is your pro your computer will connect with a drone as it's another internet connection. And then the drone with SAP commands from your computer to do different things.

168
00:28:52.290 --> 00:29:01.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now, the little as I say will do the basics out this go here and there and I sort of the EDU you can do what's called a swarm

169
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:09.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you can fly simultaneously more than one of these and you can then put up shows and demonstrations.

170
00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:26.460
MS Analytics Class 2021: With more than one snap recently I saw a celebration and Mexico where he would say something like, Fourth of July celebration, but instead of using fireworks. They started the present the show with

171
00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:42.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: Probably 1000 drums up in the sky, and it was just an awesome thing to say that they were they, you know, they flow together make signs made animals and moved from the sky, all that sort of thing. It's pretty awesome.

172
00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:50.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah, so this is

173
00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:52.890
MS Analytics Class 2021: A model.

174
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.600
Hermano C Ferreira: I think the question is from Karen, Dr. Jones.

175
00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:05.160
MS Analytics Class 2021: Lolo

176
00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:13.080
Karen Fireman: Jones. It's Karen, I was asking you where, where are the week one pandas notes you

177
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:16.950
Karen Fireman: Know, something listed. I don't see on our online.

178
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.310
MS Analytics Class 2021: I think you were you you want

179
00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:34.740
Hermano C Ferreira: Yes, sir. I was but but but i don't think that the day we're

180
00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:37.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: Here.

181
00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:45.660
MS Analytics Class 2021: Going to be a little bit easier. This is not this particular week one more proper example I gave you the code.

182
00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:47.730
MS Analytics Class 2021: You know,

183
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:53.730
MS Analytics Class 2021: You have your code example, the word wrong. And then all you need to do is this altar.

184
00:30:54.330 --> 00:31:08.790
MS Analytics Class 2021: So, and then you have a one week where you have those assignment at all. So you have basically two weeks there. We are going to be honest, no assignments and you have the entire semester to organize and work on the

185
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:13.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: Project, so I don't make sense to me that heavy and there are no exams.

186
00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: Alright.

187
00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:24.960
Sounds good.

188
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.920
MS Analytics Class 2021: Oh,

189
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

190
00:31:49.980 --> 00:32:02.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: Of hands off programming. So most of the class today, you're going to open a Python. We're going to work together on some code. And so at the end of the class, your

191
00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:08.460
MS Analytics Class 2021: Takeaway will be some actual code that you develop your code as I get it.

192
00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.050
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay. The, the slides.

193
00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:23.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: Someplace there is some documentation and things like that that will talk about, but I don't. I haven't found the slides for this particular class and useful.

194
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

195
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:35.970
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let me know if I'm wrong. I think we have some more formality to the slides anything. Let me know, okay, I appreciate your opinion.

196
00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:38.580
Karen Fireman: Thank you. Yeah.

197
00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:41.010
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

198
00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:44.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: Mr. Vargas guitar.

199
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:47.520
MS Analytics Class 2021: Jam.

200
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:50.880
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

201
00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.730
MS Analytics Class 2021: All right, I, the reason I wanted to talk about show you I have this

202
00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:10.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: Information on the tell tell where are you getting these like that we're actually not going to use this drone for about four weeks or five weeks it's optional.

203
00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:16.020
MS Analytics Class 2021: The homework assignment will not require you to actually have one of these

204
00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:34.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: You'll be asked to create a program and that we can run it in cloud on your sentence. I mean, we can run it in class, using the Dremel so I have. Okay, so you don't need one of these terms. But if you've ever been curious about these things. This is an opportunity to check it out. So

205
00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:36.540
MS Analytics Class 2021: If you

206
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:42.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: Those of you that already have drones. Maybe you have that some people may already have one of these

207
00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:56.310
MS Analytics Class 2021: But these are used in K through 12 and also in the university to teach the idea of programming you a nice. This is the app you can download from

208
00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:04.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: The internet and this is the app implies a drone. If you want to use your cell phone, the client. And this is what it looks like. By yourself.

209
00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:15.270
MS Analytics Class 2021: So that's the floor right that's the rub is sitting on the road, take off. But when you click on this little button in the upper left here. That's a take off button.

210
00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:21.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it actually rises up from wherever you're sitting and gets to a certain level hovers

211
00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:34.470
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then this these two red circles you see at the bottom, or like joysticks that you can move to navigate the drone maybe go up or down forward or back left or right, that kind of thing.

212
00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:43.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: This button on the upper right is to take pictures and if the if the bucket is white and you press it means you're going to take a photograph of whatever it's looking at

213
00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:56.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: If you hit the button here a little next to it, it changes over to video and this becomes read. And then if you hit it. It will take a movie to make a movie of whatever whatever it's looking at

214
00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:09.300
MS Analytics Class 2021: So little information here about how this works. And if you have any questions about it, let me know. But as I say it is optional and right up here at the beginning, I think I see something about that.

215
00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:19.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: Interested in painting one reauthorize talks, don't you don't mean real is

216
00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:37.020
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay that's we're going to talk about his panelists. And so what I'd like you to do is first of all if you haven't already done so, download be the data.

217
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:40.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: And that would be the

218
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: First file in there.

219
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:45.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let's see, where is it

220
00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:57.540
MS Analytics Class 2021: OK, so the textbook way and right here under pandas.

221
00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:07.050
MS Analytics Class 2021: This file. But I'm talking about gap minder DSC so excuse me, let me get my notes movie here.

222
00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:11.850
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is the

223
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:27.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now some of you probably already know we're going to be talking about, then the focus is on canvas.

224
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:45.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now, if you're like me, you have to do certain things with panelists, we see that in other classes, but there are certain things that I forgot about or I didn't know how to do. So this, this is going to be a short reminder of that. To do this, we're going to open up

225
00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:51.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: Please go ahead and open a bag on that and we're going to use Jupiter notebook.

226
00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:56.460
MS Analytics Class 2021: So I'm going to launch the Jupiter notebook here.

227
00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:09.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: And this is included in in your attic on installation.

228
00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:17.250
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then another app called Tinker, which will be looking at here is also included in your installation.

229
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.250
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

230
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:27.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: Says, which one do you want to open. I think I'll use Chrome

231
00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:01.560
MS Analytics Class 2021: So let's

232
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: Have your data.

233
00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.120
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let's see this

234
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:33.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: I said by on my desktop within the course number on that now you have as a folder. What you should probably do is do something similar set up a folder somewhere and that folder, then you can put your pipeline code and

235
00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:37.470
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let's see.

236
00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:53.700
MS Analytics Class 2021: All right, the data that I'm looking for is right here and there it is. I put all the data files in that folder.

237
00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:55.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: And

238
00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:08.010
MS Analytics Class 2021: All right, so if I clicked on it inside of Jupiter. You can see what this file looks like this is a town deluded and file.

239
00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:28.530
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so it's quite a large file I have 123456 columns. The first of all it's all country. So first row is tall he have a name for each of the columns and in the left hand side you have the road number

240
00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now that growth numbers that actually is a file.

241
00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:52.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: Jupiter notebook is creating an index column virtual index on and it has the room number in. That's why you don't see a heading for that first call. So the rope number for the names is rule number one, right.

242
00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: And

243
00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:58.920
MS Analytics Class 2021: So let's go down now and

244
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:09.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: How do we set up this we have, let's see, we want to make sure we're invited on right so let's go to

245
00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:16.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: There is Python.

246
00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:20.100
MS Analytics Class 2021: So the language supply on

247
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:25.530
MS Analytics Class 2021: And you can see it on the right hand side I have Python there.

248
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:32.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: OK.

249
00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: OK.

250
00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:51.150
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now what I want to do is actually use this the program and bite on and for our users in a while, how I did it by

251
00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.310
MS Analytics Class 2021: Jupiter figure

252
00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.010
MS Analytics Class 2021: Language, or your

253
00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:31.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: File and the language here now. Like, which

254
00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:39.780
MS Analytics Class 2021: Which one is good answers this file edit the language over language.

255
00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:42.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: Over right

256
00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:10.560
MS Analytics Class 2021: But I was expecting to see a Python prompts. There it is. Where does she play file. Okay, Father, usually

257
00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:21.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah, the game three and zero their job right there. That's what you have, especially when

258
00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.690
MS Analytics Class 2021: The terminal broken to get there.

259
00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:33.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: So that's where you want again and then now you have an ego for crazy now you're hearing sterilizing

260
00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:42.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, yeah, yeah.

261
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:44.880
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now this was

262
00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:49.860
MS Analytics Class 2021: So my previous searches for America. Yeah.

263
00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:54.480
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah, so you had to go to that.

264
00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:58.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you have to go john process. The second

265
00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:09.600
MS Analytics Class 2021: There. If you get to go around here. So, like, I don't know if you started with me regarding here. You click there Yun that's what starts this

266
00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:15.660
MS Analytics Class 2021: So here is wrong. He did. From here, you start paper from here. Yeah.

267
00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:18.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: You get from them as well.

268
00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:20.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: I just go from the

269
00:43:22.650 --> 00:43:34.860
MS Analytics Class 2021: Format. We didn't do that. So that's, that's, that's just then I started from here I'm going to hear and what did you learn about their there. This will started so that you have

270
00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:38.310
Yeah.

271
00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:43.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah.

272
00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:53.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay. And have you know where you're at. So, that is what greater urine. So then, then you can say say yeah

273
00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:58.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: This, this one probably saved in the ballpark really foster last

274
00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: option here is so we can disclose a sauna.

275
00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:16.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: Documents and go

276
00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:18.690
Home.

277
00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:32.280
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah, this one. Yeah, and go to bed assure everyone. And so, David. Yeah.

278
00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:35.910
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah.

279
00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:38.250
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then we have

280
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:41.100
MS Analytics Class 2021: Something here.

281
00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:47.460
MS Analytics Class 2021: Data just say new

282
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:49.290
MS Analytics Class 2021: Right there.

283
00:44:50.700 --> 00:45:00.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah, so that's going to be saying sharing here we're showing a desktop right on there so I can share

284
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:04.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: So we should be read it.

285
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:12.540
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah, absolutely. If I type in something like Dr. Or something like that going into directory. No, no. Yeah.

286
00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:25.320
MS Analytics Class 2021: And he doesn't respond to use them and see you back. And yeah, a lot of what I do is I read a file. So I want to say something like, D, E, F is equal to

287
00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:28.860
MS Analytics Class 2021: For a well informed.

288
00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:33.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: And this as PD.

289
00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.890
MS Analytics Class 2021: And important

290
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: That's all. Yeah.

291
00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:44.730
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then we run right

292
00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:54.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: And the reservoir do there is a data frame is equal to PD dot read

293
00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:02.910
MS Analytics Class 2021: Not CSE. I think this is a reason

294
00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:06.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then gap minder

295
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:12.840
MS Analytics Class 2021: Dot TSP. Now we run this, we should get an error.

296
00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:17.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: Because this is not a CSV file.

297
00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:21.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: Is supposed to be understood.

298
00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:23.610
Karis Jochen: Yeah. Yes, sir.

299
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:25.470
Karis Jochen: Yes.

300
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:27.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah.

301
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:30.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then we want a separator si p

302
00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:36.570
MS Analytics Class 2021: Equals two and slash t like that. Okay.

303
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:40.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: So let's examine the rain record here.

304
00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:45.840
MS Analytics Class 2021: Looks like I am. So if I say you say friend.

305
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:48.480
MS Analytics Class 2021: The head.

306
00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:03.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, we're running out. Thanks.

307
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:12.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: Notebook in Asia. So that's kind of what my problem is

308
00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:16.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: I hope some of you at home are not having the same problems.

309
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:18.390
MS Analytics Class 2021: But

310
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:28.920
MS Analytics Class 2021: If you get caught up here. If you are. So what are some of the panelists commands that are very, very useful that we don't normally look at

311
00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:46.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: This this command. For example, the use of the separator slash say people tab reading the tablet is vital. Now, when would you like to have a template and file. And so the common comma separated but

312
00:47:46.560 --> 00:48:04.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: Well, the problem with the basic problem with all separate files is if you've ever string in there and that string as a valid comment in there, then it's going to have a boat read that correctly every problem, the status of data debris.

313
00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:24.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it sees more than, say, six of us in a string. I mean, in the line escape to freak out and say, well, look, the data is not set up to have six columns in it. So the Texas region is my favorite way to separate

314
00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:37.680
MS Analytics Class 2021: file that has stream beta in common words find that all the file Of all the columns are generic. But when you have something that has a streaming, then you're going to want to use bows.

315
00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:51.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: And if for no other reason that is just a little bit safer in case somebody has an extra column, and there it won't get upset about that. So this is the law option SCP or by the way.

316
00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let me see if I can make you smarter.

317
00:48:59.010 --> 00:48:59.490
MS Analytics Class 2021: No.

318
00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:08.910
MS Analytics Class 2021: No.

319
00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:18.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: That's I think that might be learned as I can get without wearing off their

320
00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:26.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: Thing. Okay. I hope you can see that maybe a little better. Is that okay

321
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:35.490
MS Analytics Class 2021: That's all right. Good. Yeah, yeah. Part of the problem doing this the way we're doing it, it says some of these things are the Lord and see some time.

322
00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:47.400
MS Analytics Class 2021: The other, the other thing I wanted to point out was there's a special command that we haven't ordinarily us very much. And it's called a type command. So if I type inside

323
00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:50.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: Then def like this.

324
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:53.310
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let me run that and see what

325
00:49:54.330 --> 00:50:05.400
MS Analytics Class 2021: Give me an error. Yeah, okay. Oh, I did. Okay. I thought it was going to have a practice or something like that. But yeah, if you have a an object or variable in

326
00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:21.120
MS Analytics Class 2021: Python and you want to see what type it is that just use the type function. So as you can see, this is a handles it tells us right off. It's a band score data frame and which is a special type of options.

327
00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:25.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now, if you had a number of the array or get a different type

328
00:50:26.220 --> 00:50:44.250
MS Analytics Class 2021: And in fact, that you have an object that you've created and from modeling or something like that and you'll get an even different type of stuff so that that function is used to identify a primitive the variables. For example, if I say X is equal to 10 right

329
00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:46.620
MS Analytics Class 2021: What time is a

330
00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:50.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: Time well

331
00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.040
Zuberi, Bilal Mustafa: That's an integer.

332
00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:55.950
Energy right

333
00:50:57.330 --> 00:51:03.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: That's correct, yeah. So I run that and I MC or or editor. Right.

334
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:08.460
MS Analytics Class 2021: Sometimes if we can enter shoes and clothes and here's

335
00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:09.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: All

336
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:16.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: The time command is used occasionally to figure out how to manage and deal with here.

337
00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:22.590
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now let's use a lot is David bring about shade.

338
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:29.100
MS Analytics Class 2021: And that is that is it. What time is that, let's see time

339
00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:36.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: And if I will be out of shape like this.

340
00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:37.920
Oops.

341
00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:43.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: It's as simple

342
00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:57.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: As a temple temple is like this, except for the same clothes with criticism set of brackets. And the thing about Drupal is you cannot change what's in tool.

343
00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:07.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: That's controlled by who are brave people. So if I say do Shane by itself.

344
00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.530
MS Analytics Class 2021: You can just run that

345
00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:34.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: You can see it's a tool to Members and the first number is the number of rows of the course. And the second one is the number of columns. And so if you wanted number of rows. Let's say X is equal to the shade and then you would use brackets not not parenthesis because football is a dress.

346
00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:37.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: Like

347
00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:38.940
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is

348
00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:51.840
MS Analytics Class 2021: So when you see that in anything. Oh, he or she must be a list. It looks like a list because that's the way you would address the first element of the list. But no, it turns out that they

349
00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:57.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: Use the same, same, but they have different data structures.

350
00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now another

351
00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: Can command that we have is he at home.

352
00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:08.340
MS Analytics Class 2021: He has columns, you can do that.

353
00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:28.530
MS Analytics Class 2021: There we go. And so what this does is it brings back a list of all the column names and I have 1236 different columns here. And if I say the boss.

354
00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:32.370
MS Analytics Class 2021: And zero like that.

355
00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:36.480
MS Analytics Class 2021: Get the first of all nine

356
00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:38.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah.

357
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:43.110
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now, what is the difference between i'm going to

358
00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:51.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: Do this and I like to see answer this one. Fred

359
00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:54.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: The

360
00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:57.390
MS Analytics Class 2021: Shade shade.

361
00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:01.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: That's the first one. The second one.

362
00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:04.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: The

363
00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:11.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: Shade a bang like that.

364
00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:14.790
MS Analytics Class 2021: Nurses difference

365
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:18.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: So what I just said about shade and the

366
00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:22.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: Presence is accurate. What is it,

367
00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: Jerry, are you there.

368
00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:34.380
Karen Fireman: Yes.

369
00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:42.510
Clay Coleman: One, if you put the parentheses is calling it calling a function

370
00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:46.830
Clay Coleman: Yes, or

371
00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:49.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: Were you were you said

372
00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:56.340
Clay Coleman: If you put the parentheses after shape. You're calling the shape function. And if it. I don't think the shape has a function

373
00:54:56.970 --> 00:54:58.830
MS Analytics Class 2021: That's right. It's a Drupal right

374
00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:01.590
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah, so let's see what happens.

375
00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:20.280
MS Analytics Class 2021: There. The first one actually the Drupal numbers, the same one is an error because, for example, the reason you mentioned when you put parentheses after that it takes its function and solids and it's actually a doable.

376
00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:27.660
MS Analytics Class 2021: Of course, when you Ryan to get the Emory know right away. Oh, hey, Rebecca, those parentheses all

377
00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:32.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now here's

378
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:39.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: The time

379
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:45.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: Versus

380
00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:50.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: This

381
00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:58.470
MS Analytics Class 2021: So he's one of these is going to work for us.

382
00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:00.300
MS Analytics Class 2021: This one.

383
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:09.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, so we're getting we're getting the data out here.

384
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:11.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: No error message.

385
00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:15.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: So which one, which one is which.

386
00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:35.550
Karis Jochen: Professor whenever you're using Jupiter notebook. I think it often outputs. The last thing that you wrote, so it's not. Yeah. So the first one was only out, putting the info, not the

387
00:56:35.550 --> 00:56:36.000
Detox

388
00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:43.470
Karis Jochen: Hi, Dr. Jones.

389
00:56:47.790 --> 00:57:06.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: I typed in DIA DE types like that. And this is what I get for that. So it comes back and tells us that I have a couple of objects and countries and object object and then the rest are either integers or 40.6 before

390
00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:09.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: Why this country option.

391
00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:12.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: Well,

392
00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:17.100
Zuberi, Bilal Mustafa: In cars because it has probably characters in it.

393
00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:19.050
MS Analytics Class 2021: Was that

394
00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:29.970
Zuberi, Bilal Mustafa: Because they all have it country in it has characters in it. That's why it's an object because it doesn't know if those characters need anything else.

395
00:57:30.090 --> 00:57:33.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: Right. So these guys are strange

396
00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:36.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: And

397
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:44.970
MS Analytics Class 2021: It wasn't put a string. If you're working in another language. You put it straight here, but it is it is good citizen spring off.

398
00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:50.010
MS Analytics Class 2021: What do info.

399
00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:52.350
MS Analytics Class 2021: Function.

400
00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:58.890
MS Analytics Class 2021: Alright.

401
00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:11.760
MS Analytics Class 2021: So today, that gives you some other information about the, the number of missing nano

402
00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:16.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: 1700 and that we have no missing values.

403
00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:23.790
MS Analytics Class 2021: And the main types and are too close to integers and two options.

404
00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:40.620
MS Analytics Class 2021: So the GMO is a little bit more sophisticated look at the data types, you look at the data, but also there are missing a summary probably different data, but she actually have

405
00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:52.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: All right. How do I

406
00:58:52.830 --> 00:58:53.910
Shown

407
00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:59.910
MS Analytics Class 2021: The first five rows. Well, you just say the head

408
00:59:01.410 --> 00:59:07.890
MS Analytics Class 2021: This, this function, the head shows the first five rows of data.

409
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:13.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then if you want to look the last slide the tail.

410
00:59:18.330 --> 00:59:33.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah, like, like I was saying earlier, you probably already know this, or at least you've seen it somewhere because we've already. This is jack your second and third class I think with Python programming.

411
00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:45.450
MS Analytics Class 2021: And of course you would have used this in those other classes, but this is more like a review and actually some of these a light forgotten myself because I don't use them all the time.

412
00:59:47.490 --> 01:00:02.370
MS Analytics Class 2021: So suppose I wanted a subset of file. There are certain ways we've agreed subset. One way is, I could say take specific rose instead of taking all the roads and state subset of the rose

413
01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:18.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: The other is to take a subset of the calls. Well, get a subset of the columns is one of the easier things to do here, because if I wanted just a simple like country, for example, I can say country.

414
01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:27.690
MS Analytics Class 2021: The a is equal to be and then country.

415
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:32.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: By God, so pretty easy syntax.

416
01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:36.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so then if I look in country.

417
01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:39.270
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah.

418
01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:45.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: You can see I have a new game brain.

419
01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:48.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: With just a single call

420
01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:53.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now, what, what's the time frame.

421
01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.280
MS Analytics Class 2021: Is a fantasy.

422
01:01:04.470 --> 01:01:11.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: So there's something called fantasy series a series is a vector and not be

423
01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:30.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: They behave the same the same sort of way. Some languages are some packages. Rather, they say, I want to know me better but what they don't tell you is that usually they'll accept the fan of series because they're both factors.

424
01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:41.730
MS Analytics Class 2021: So country the app is not paying for him. Really, it's a series and the series will be a differently. It's index differently.

425
01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:57.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you don't have rows and columns and you just have one you just have rows, period. So normally would with a brand, you have to have a row number and then call number to access a value with a serious, you just need one number which is the road.

426
01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:04.470
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now if I wanted more than one poem, I could say multi

427
01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:11.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: Media is equal to bail for him. And now you say for country.

428
01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:21.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: As calm and maybe another column will be. We'll see what we have here a year.

429
01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:23.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: Loose

430
01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:30.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: Cotton.

431
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:42.780
MS Analytics Class 2021: Here.

432
01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:50.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: Hear

433
01:02:53.610 --> 01:02:57.030
Leiah Wyckoff: That because you've used brackets instead of parentheses.

434
01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:06.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: See

435
01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:16.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: Here it goes. My was Thomas

436
01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:41.760
MS Analytics Class 2021: Oh,

437
01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:49.680
Karis Jochen: Professor, you have to pass them as a list.

438
01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:54.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: Oh,

439
01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:06.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah.

440
01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:31.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah.

441
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.860
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

442
01:04:55.350 --> 01:05:09.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah, this is mentioned in chapter one is specifically the type of everyone errors that you can run into is that if you use it. He tried to access multiple columns. It has to be a list. So that was

443
01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:17.070
MS Analytics Class 2021: All right, let's take a, let's take a five minute break here or 10 minute break.

444
01:05:17.730 --> 01:05:20.970
MS Analytics Class 2021: And get something to drink, and we'll get right back to this.

445
01:05:23.010 --> 01:05:23.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

446
01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.470
MS Analytics Class 2021: Oh,

447
01:05:58.050 --> 01:06:00.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: So if you want to run oneself.

448
01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:06.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: Cell. If you want to just run one cell it shifts and enter

449
01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:11.640
MS Analytics Class 2021: So, so yeah, so like around like this cell here.

450
01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:17.250
MS Analytics Class 2021: Like say France shift enter, yeah. Yeah.

451
01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:26.640
MS Analytics Class 2021: Shift and then enter it'll run itself. I don't usually use the

452
01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:30.480
MS Analytics Class 2021: As you can see, yeah.

453
01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:42.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then controller will just run the cell. The shift, shift, shift their runs it and then goes and creates a new cell below it, Control Enter, just runs it and stays there.

454
01:06:44.130 --> 01:06:52.020
MS Analytics Class 2021: So, what time is it, seven yes 707 I was good at 707

455
01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:55.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: I'm thinking a good are shipped over

456
01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:02.130
MS Analytics Class 2021: Time. So this is going slower than born yeah so much to cover interested like

457
01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:17.520
MS Analytics Class 2021: What are you coming from covering for the rest of the night. Well, I wanted to the main thing that I wanted to cover is the going to tinker, tinker, yeah. And that goes, we'd have to go, you're going to be using spider for. Gotcha. So

458
01:07:18.810 --> 01:07:24.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: That's this people are probably familiar with, or Tina what's in the book. Yeah.

459
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:36.780
MS Analytics Class 2021: So I never run tonight, but I'll be back next Tuesday. Oh, you will now my come back every Tuesday, just kind of watch who can see how to weave it into my class.

460
01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:46.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: Tonight on the legal or like, well, I will be back next week we'll use a good word. Yeah, take her right

461
01:07:47.850 --> 01:07:57.780
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah, I'll watch it this weekend. Thank you. No worries. Yeah, I actually, I use Visual Studio code now.

462
01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:08.130
MS Analytics Class 2021: The Python extension use one of Visual Studio code for Microsoft the Python extension inside of that is really good. So when you write your code and you run it.

463
01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:18.570
MS Analytics Class 2021: It'll run inside of a notebook for years. He just type the code. And when you run into individual cells will actually put them as a Python Jupiter helpful.

464
01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:32.340
MS Analytics Class 2021: And run. It's pretty cool Lucido Visual Studio. I'll send you a link. I actually have actually for the winter, spring. It's a Microsoft Visual Studio code. Okay, that's great startup costs Visual Studio.

465
01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.840
Jordan Gross: Platforms professor. It's on Linux, it's on Mac.

466
01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.480
MS Analytics Class 2021: Away rather let us welcome back. It's

467
01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:41.490
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah, it's really, really great.

468
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:48.300
Jordan Gross: And I use it on every platform. I code in for every language I code in I

469
01:08:48.450 --> 01:08:50.640
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah, that's all user my class.

470
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:58.410
Zuberi, Bilal Mustafa: And and it's fairly low more intuitive fighting the browser and it does code completion.

471
01:09:00.930 --> 01:09:07.050
Jordan Gross: The virtual environments are really were fantastic for me being able to just manage the packages and update them.

472
01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:08.340
MS Analytics Class 2021: Into your digital

473
01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:21.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: Broker, so it's, I love it. It's not like it Python code is basically. Hey, I got a model that I built upon how, like, what are the options. It's also, it's also like, hey, I want to be.

474
01:09:22.290 --> 01:09:22.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: A

475
01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:24.090
Jordan Gross: data scientist and engineer or

476
01:09:24.090 --> 01:09:25.260
Zuberi, Bilal Mustafa: Something and

477
01:09:25.710 --> 01:09:28.560
MS Analytics Class 2021: And the real. What does that look like, how is that role of

478
01:09:29.730 --> 01:09:43.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: Agile development. What do you use a speaker or I may just take a review, where are you now. I haven't exchanged or whoever use tons and tons of Python. Yeah, and Jupiter notebooks and use that

479
01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:47.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: So I'll see you next week. Okay.

480
01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:33.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: English lower so

481
01:13:34.530 --> 01:13:35.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: Jerry there.

482
01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:42.840
Karen Fireman: Dr. Jones, I am. I was wondering if you could remind me how to how to get the

483
01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:48.990
Karen Fireman: The directory set up in the in the spider. I was I'm

484
01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:51.240
Karen Fireman: Trying to

485
01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:51.780
Send.

486
01:13:54.450 --> 01:13:54.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: Your

487
01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.490
MS Analytics Class 2021: Love. Love it. What did you say

488
01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:01.470
Karen Fireman: Um,

489
01:14:04.290 --> 01:14:14.580
Karen Fireman: I was wondering how this directory in the in the spider tool. Um, we did it before. Sure. I remember how to do that.

490
01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:17.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

491
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.340
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah.

492
01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:22.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: The only person here.

493
01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:29.430
Karen Fireman: I'm sure they're all be back. But, well, I got you. I would love to get it in there. Right.

494
01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:33.030
Karen Fireman: Had the right spot but

495
01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:34.380
Karen Fireman: I don't

496
01:14:36.450 --> 01:14:37.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: So,

497
01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:38.220
Princes

498
01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:04.470
Jim Clark: Hi, Dr. Jones. This is Jim, can you hear me.

499
01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:05.490
Yeah.

500
01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:10.350
Jim Clark: So I think I'm going to try to give a partial answer to Karen.

501
01:15:11.790 --> 01:15:30.840
Jim Clark: Based on last summer. So, Karen. You know when you when you look at the screen and you a partial solution is if you look right below the icon and you see it, for example, see slash users spider killer in a in a dot PHP file. Can you see this

502
01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:34.050
Karen Fireman: I think so, yeah, I see that

503
01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:36.300
Karen Fireman: So like seems that right

504
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:49.470
Jim Clark: I think if you can take and put that path in that is sort of a fix that I've used is probably not efficient, but it, it tells you what are you, where are you pointing to the file.

505
01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:55.680
Karen Fireman: Right, I can't seem to change it, Jim. I appreciate that. I can't remember how to change that.

506
01:15:55.770 --> 01:15:59.580
Jim Clark: Okay, so go and go to the top. Go up at the top of the icon or

507
01:15:59.910 --> 01:16:02.220
Jim Clark: If you move your mouse over to the right, you'll see

508
01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:09.090
Jim Clark: A C colon users slash is it Lowry l l o w ROI. So

509
01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:13.170
Jim Clark: Very top very top row below that played

510
01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:14.460
Jim Clark: The

511
01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:16.290
Jim Clark: Know,

512
01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:17.460
Karen Fireman: The file open like

513
01:16:18.450 --> 01:16:21.630
Jim Clark: No man. Good, good, good, good. Give me your screen again.

514
01:16:22.530 --> 01:16:23.250
Karen Fireman: It's not mine.

515
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.850
Jim Clark: Okay, so when you look at your screen and you look with a folder as well because the upper right hand corner of the screen.

516
01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:31.050
Karen Fireman: With the upper right.

517
01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.580
Karen Fireman: Not left upper right, yeah.

518
01:16:32.610 --> 01:16:34.140
Jim Clark: For right where the open folders.

519
01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:38.130
Jim Clark: And so there's a rectangular area there and there's a fascinating.

520
01:16:39.330 --> 01:16:46.950
Jim Clark: I think if you go through and can set that that will that will also set your, your path for your, for your Python path.

521
01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:49.740
Karen Fireman: Okay, I thought that

522
01:16:51.390 --> 01:16:53.910
Karen Fireman: Didn't didn't choose it. Thank you for trying, Jim.

523
01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:57.300
Jim Clark: Okay, well I'm sorry I made a major stab at it.

524
01:16:57.870 --> 01:17:00.600
Karen Fireman: No, I appreciate it. I know it's something like that.

525
01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:08.940
Karen Fireman: There's a way to do it. The form is

526
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.720
Okay.

527
01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:30.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: I'm working right now or concern isn't covering the other material which is to enter this material that we're talking about right now is in the book chapters one through three. And so we have a chance to come back, but I'll do that. Otherwise, please read chapters, or one into

528
01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:38.550
MS Analytics Class 2021: As part of your assignment and when you read, you don't have to go over a lot of detail, I think you can scan it pretty quickly.

529
01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:48.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: Get the you know the you're going to see a lot of things in there that you recognize, you know, and every once while I run into something at least this my experience there was

530
01:17:49.680 --> 01:18:02.280
MS Analytics Class 2021: Something like, for example, that it excellent because we have the column names inside of the list. That shouldn't be through the obvious, but obviously, that was something that I miss

531
01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:18.270
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, we're going to go now entertainer TK I NT er I so shut down right now we're going to get back out of the book. And we're going to go back into spider.

532
01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:20.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

533
01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:26.730
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now this is the program, I'd like you to work on with me.

534
01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:31.560
MS Analytics Class 2021: I hope you can read but I plated

535
01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: It's a simple program.

536
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:39.930
MS Analytics Class 2021: And let me run for you to show you what you should, yeah.

537
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:43.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so I'm gonna hit the green button up here.

538
01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let me minimize this and see

539
01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:01.320
MS Analytics Class 2021: Wow.

540
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:03.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

541
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:16.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is what you should get the LEAD program.

542
01:19:17.790 --> 01:19:30.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: It's a little Bob. Bob, do you see that now this is not a real big doing because it's very simple program what this program is doing is creating baba

543
01:19:32.070 --> 01:19:37.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: When you run. And then if you press on this little button that says angry.

544
01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:49.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: And if you look at your output is fighter. You shouldn't see the word. How about what we hear when you press that now let me see if I can

545
01:19:50.190 --> 01:19:59.160
MS Analytics Class 2021: There it is. So you can see what I press here on the on the going the word howdy comes up in the upper right hand side.

546
01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:01.620
MS Analytics Class 2021: You see that

547
01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:04.830
MS Analytics Class 2021: Is visible on your screen.

548
01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:07.890
Zuberi, Bilal Mustafa: Yes, it is.

549
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:12.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yes, you get the idea. Now, so this is a simple going

550
01:20:13.770 --> 01:20:21.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is made using the package for TK. If you are, and also

551
01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:26.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: There's a little package as you see here is called TK

552
01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:38.460
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, now these packages have been around since before my on these factors were actually in C and Java and then they were over in the Bible.

553
01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:55.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: The mother baggage is one ball TK tango to that is, is the basic package and if you go to the campus. We go back to see if I can find breezy campus here as

554
01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:59.010
MS Analytics Class 2021: Well, it was here.

555
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:12.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: If you go back to week one on campus here.

556
01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:16.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: You'll see it says senior

557
01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:23.910
MS Analytics Class 2021: Version 8.5 reference this reference is a large PDF file.

558
01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:36.120
MS Analytics Class 2021: You should download this to your either and put it somewhere where you can refer to it this reference for taker is about 168 patients.

559
01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:40.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it's basically detail about

560
01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:56.130
MS Analytics Class 2021: The options and settings for different parameters. So theory Wi Fi reference a UI, but boy five on graphical reverse movies and for of course graphical user interface.

561
01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:12.270
MS Analytics Class 2021: And if you're developing apps for usage work or otherwise you might want to make absolutely those apps, by creating the gooey and this, this is the documentation for t day

562
01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:26.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: Very well organized and very easy to find information on how you set up a certain structure and you're going that way because the UI that we were just running

563
01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:29.520
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let me go back to that.

564
01:22:33.150 --> 01:22:40.320
MS Analytics Class 2021: Good wine again. And stop. There it is, it's up here came up in the upper left hand corner.

565
01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:54.270
MS Analytics Class 2021: We make it a little larger. You can see it there. So when you create a new you start with a fresh Candace, this is all the window, the canvas and there's nothing on it.

566
01:22:55.830 --> 01:23:15.840
MS Analytics Class 2021: All you see is little red X here. I'm in the eyes and the SRP maybe larger the standard features and you see on on most apps and most of the winners here this material to senior level was put there by this program. So you start

567
01:23:16.860 --> 01:23:37.290
MS Analytics Class 2021: By creating a blank canvas, and then he puts up on canvas. Let's take a little bit of code that's going to stop this right now. And so the first thing you want to do is you want to import from TK I and II our boards are

568
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:46.830
MS Analytics Class 2021: This basically imports everything that the baggage was all hundred 68 pages and more that you saw that documentation.

569
01:23:48.300 --> 01:24:00.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then from Tinker important de de de de de de is the is the bad as a sub baggage with a taker. That is most useful or populating the back end.

570
01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:09.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: So on that canvas, as you just saw there were two things. One, label to about

571
01:24:10.890 --> 01:24:16.320
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let's see how those are created. So as you see here, it says class.

572
01:24:17.370 --> 01:24:28.560
MS Analytics Class 2021: You when you set the gooey. Normally you create your own class classes a description of what you want that really look like and what it does. Okay.

573
01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:38.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: When you program a movie. This is probably something that you haven't worried about it before you have to worry about threading.

574
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:53.130
MS Analytics Class 2021: And you have to worry about multiple executions, so a Google you set up to allow users to run more than one Bobby simultaneously not wanted.

575
01:24:54.600 --> 01:25:03.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: Most programs that you develop and run, you know, in the past, you create one program you're in London, you're done.

576
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:15.570
MS Analytics Class 2021: Well with a gooey. You want to set it up so there are multiple people can run multiple copies. I'm saying here simultaneously and they won't crash into each other.

577
01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:24.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, that's all multi threading or parallel programming. So we're going to do that, you're going to see how to do that here.

578
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:28.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: This class highlighted in blue.

579
01:25:30.150 --> 01:25:38.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: Is complete description of that going. Let's talk about what it is. It says class, my personal, you can call it what you wanna

580
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:50.460
MS Analytics Class 2021: Call it what you want, but when you run the schooling. That's what you're going to use. You're going to say my first do a run, something like that.

581
01:25:51.180 --> 01:26:12.780
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it's going to do what it says here. So you'll notice that are two functions as good as class the first function is always required it's underscore under that's a double underscore I nit double underscore and then in parentheses. The word itself and then another item called Mastering

582
01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:21.390
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, let's talk about what this is. If you see a function with every class as the visualization function.

583
01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:33.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: And see program and other programming, we will be called instantiate in Java programming. So this creates an instance of your job really

584
01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:45.690
MS Analytics Class 2021: So I didn't create several different instances. Okay, all I'm going to have the same characteristics but they're going to be running separately and they may be doing separate things.

585
01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:52.890
MS Analytics Class 2021: So in this case, who is your simple what is going to say, howdy howdy howdy, Eric. I'm impressed about

586
01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:59.730
MS Analytics Class 2021: Pretty soon we're going to be moving promise to doing something more complicated more interesting.

587
01:27:02.010 --> 01:27:12.180
MS Analytics Class 2021: So the identity function is a visualization option and basically an ID function describes what you want the going to look like.

588
01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:39.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you're here, you see self have a bathroom. The word itself is is is used to indicate that the variables that I'm going to create here are going to be unique for every got the word self created refinances is a previous to all variants, for example, says so doc master is equal to mass

589
01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:57.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: I'm actually creating a copy of the master that's coming in that. What is that master that's coming in. Well, we'll get to that. But basically it's a blank canvas, the word mastery here is basically a blank canvas, you'll see that

590
01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:12.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: I created a copy of that white canvas, and I call it so period master. And the reason I'm doing that is because I want to mess up the original canvas.

591
01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:18.480
MS Analytics Class 2021: Page on the original canvas. I want to create a new copy of that again is another thing on that.

592
01:28:19.230 --> 01:28:32.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: And I'm going to do that separately. Every time you call me because I want you to have the ability of creating several instances of this school at all. Some things we already know the same here at the same time.

593
01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:40.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: But doing different things. And in order to do that I have to do with a that Amazon pollen itself period masks.

594
01:28:42.510 --> 01:28:48.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: Next, they are doing good. My master file master period file several going

595
01:28:50.100 --> 01:29:01.830
MS Analytics Class 2021: Know, St. Louis, and I made a mistake here. Okay, let me break this, I did not good self period master in front of that I should have done.

596
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:17.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: Otherwise, every value the school, he's going to have the same title which is okay. It's not a big deal but programming wise I need to keep the separate. So I'd say self period master. Hi.

597
01:29:18.630 --> 01:29:27.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is basically says, I'm okay this blank canvas. I have here at the top of the way and there's another pilot called chivalry.

598
01:29:28.650 --> 01:29:37.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now you got it going, he thought, Karen Scully. He said, James going with everyone about the lead.

599
01:29:38.910 --> 01:29:39.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: Alright.

600
01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:46.470
MS Analytics Class 2021: So now when I run this. I'm going to show you what it looks like. Oh, it pops up years ago.

601
01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:51.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now,

602
01:29:53.880 --> 01:30:03.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: You see over here in the upper left hand corner. It says symbol going, that's the title of the canvas. I told you about. Not a big deal but

603
01:30:04.590 --> 01:30:21.570
MS Analytics Class 2021: If you want your company's logo to show up there, or your department name or the day where you're running or something like that. This is where you hit us a viable option with Master okay right in here.

604
01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:34.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now I'm going to agree that label. This is our first movie. That's the label. Well, the object that you put on the canvas is all label.

605
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:54.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you say self that label is equal to TT data label. Notice that this is all cases. Why do you think Dave's important TK package and inside that package is a is a widget or widgets, as all the label.

606
01:30:56.640 --> 01:31:00.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: And where am I going to put that label. I'm going to put it on master.

607
01:31:02.010 --> 01:31:06.540
MS Analytics Class 2021: And really I should have said itself that master right there.

608
01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:10.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, and

609
01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:12.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: Then I say,

610
01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:14.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: Live label.

611
01:31:15.390 --> 01:31:20.010
MS Analytics Class 2021: Says, Okay, this is right before you put it on the canvas.

612
01:31:21.090 --> 01:31:26.790
MS Analytics Class 2021: For the next to the mobile space on cans and then I'm going to create one.

613
01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:30.390
MS Analytics Class 2021: Is Holly Reebok you follow everyone

614
01:31:32.250 --> 01:31:35.760
MS Analytics Class 2021: But de de de de de de de curry, but

615
01:31:37.710 --> 01:31:48.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: Then I want to bring it put that on my canvas. So that master canvas and the one is going to be labeled any agree.

616
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:57.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: And the command associated with that button is a function of greed.

617
01:31:58.470 --> 01:32:18.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it has some period breed, which means it's a function inside this class, don't look for somewhere else is inside this lab and look down here at the bottom. See the machinery right here. So this command is pointing to the function that's inside of this class.

618
01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:36.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: You can have as many functions inside of this question, why is it bad decision. Like, and then you have other structures. For example, you have a window and you're out there was a head Brad right and you put a one in Boca grant would be withdrawn inside this window.

619
01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:50.760
MS Analytics Class 2021: So this is the basic idea behind an app or a UI is you start with a blank canvas, and then you start populating it with labels and buttons and windows and and functions that this

620
01:32:55.050 --> 01:32:56.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: Is it's

621
01:32:57.330 --> 01:33:06.450
MS Analytics Class 2021: It's not a big deal, but it is something that's very, very powerful and very useful. You're going to see, for example, some examples here where

622
01:33:07.230 --> 01:33:19.830
MS Analytics Class 2021: We can we can start one version of the movie right and then we can go live on say startup another another one. If you're watching and he's one of in the weeds up here.

623
01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:31.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: You might have a feature language. For example, English, maybe they do version of the sake of new French, German, Spanish, whatever you want and

624
01:33:32.790 --> 01:33:52.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: Then we will decide which one you want, based on the settings. This is about as simple as a movie. So what I can do is go ahead and create this on your computer, inspiring right and see what happens. Now there are some of the problems that you can run into

625
01:33:54.450 --> 01:34:15.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: But right now, here at the bottom you see those three lines, those three lines are kicking off the GUI, the first one says route to gay friends that says give me a copy of the object of the TK object, which basically is a mastermind papyrus.

626
01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:34.290
MS Analytics Class 2021: Route. There is another word for mass. It's the room, and this is the original white canvas origin populate so curry. Give me pass over to my UI see it says vipers going rooms is fasting that room that white canvas.

627
01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:38.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: Into the class, my verse going

628
01:34:39.810 --> 01:34:48.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then is returning the name of that movie and put it into this variable called My going

629
01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:52.890
MS Analytics Class 2021: So this allows you to do things like Killer.

630
01:34:54.630 --> 01:35:07.320
MS Analytics Class 2021: Or influences and suddenly he wanted to do that route main loop is the last segment here and what that is saying is, okay, run this and just keep on running in

631
01:35:07.890 --> 01:35:22.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: Those shut it down. He went running normally an unproven ego, bang, bang, bang. And then when he gets to the last statement, the program stops everything he says goodbye. Goodnight. And so then it goes away.

632
01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:35.730
MS Analytics Class 2021: Well, there's no way so you created until you talk to go away. It just sits there waiting for you to do something like in this case it's sitting there waiting for you, somebody clicked on.

633
01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:45.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: It will stay there as long as your computers running or until somebody clicks on that little x, which will be until

634
01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:49.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now,

635
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:58.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: Say, what else as far as you want to run a program every cell phone. This is how you do

636
01:35:59.970 --> 01:36:04.920
MS Analytics Class 2021: It, you can get a copy by run on your cell phone, you can run the school you and yourself.

637
01:36:06.570 --> 01:36:10.290
MS Analytics Class 2021: Or my dad or whatever else it is you want to run on

638
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

639
01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:18.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay. Anybody have this running successfully.

640
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: Answer.

641
01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:26.010
MS Analytics Class 2021: Oh,

642
01:36:26.730 --> 01:36:31.140
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yes yes yes yes alright see it's not there are

643
01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:33.150
MS Analytics Class 2021: Where's Mr.

644
01:36:34.590 --> 01:36:40.590
MS Analytics Class 2021: Roses. Yes. Okay. See how easy this is are almost like none of you that are

645
01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:52.530
MS Analytics Class 2021: Of course, seen the other movies that we're going to look at here in just a minute.

646
01:36:53.220 --> 01:37:10.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this going, and I'm going to upload it in week one folder so that you will have a copy of a copy of that in case you are having problems you can pull it off. Now this doing his fault he is one example one

647
01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:24.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: So if you look in that folder, you're going to see example one there and let me run it again make sure it's working. Incidentally, I hope I use a Mac and the goalies doesn't look like that.

648
01:37:25.290 --> 01:37:34.830
MS Analytics Class 2021: It's a little backwards. Currently, you know, back to Scott soft edges, right. So this is where we get the statement of the little soft and

649
01:37:37.770 --> 01:37:42.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: When on the map, you know, give us a little better over here. Where did that come from that school

650
01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:45.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: Anyway,

651
01:37:47.250 --> 01:37:51.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: But they both do exactly exactly the same sort of thing so

652
01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:55.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: What I want to do now. Let's see.

653
01:37:56.490 --> 01:37:57.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: Where it is

654
01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:04.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: Aaron is

655
01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:08.910
MS Analytics Class 2021: somewhere to go in week one.

656
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:11.400
MS Analytics Class 2021: And

657
01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:18.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is going to be all these out of wine.

658
01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:51.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: I see.

659
01:38:54.210 --> 01:38:54.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

660
01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:57.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: Well,

661
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:01.500
MS Analytics Class 2021: Next one.

662
01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:04.020
MS Analytics Class 2021: Strange

663
01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:12.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay. Wow. All right, let's go. Let's open up example to

664
01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:22.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: And you're going to see is similar but not exactly the same. So your house. Now, this is called example one a

665
01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:26.520
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let's say two

666
01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:29.340
MS Analytics Class 2021: To

667
01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:32.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: Receive so one on one. Look.

668
01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:38.760
MS Analytics Class 2021: No, this one is too complicated. And we're not ready for that yet.

669
01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:43.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, we're going to do the example one day or one okay follow

670
01:39:46.410 --> 01:39:55.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: And this will be example one day open. Okay. And so this one. This example is fall

671
01:39:58.860 --> 01:40:10.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: It's very similar. It's called a sample one day and you'll notice there's only one import import cheaper VC.

672
01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:16.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: Made the spirit for you. Okay.

673
01:40:18.090 --> 01:40:20.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: And 40 K capital T.

674
01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:30.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then TT all these days. So this is what we're using TK and

675
01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:38.640
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now here is this call someone who is a because this is example one day.

676
01:40:39.750 --> 01:41:00.780
MS Analytics Class 2021: And notice here that I said Master. I changed the name of the initialization part to gooey window is who I am. You can use faster here or you can use to eat when or even gooey, whatever you want to use. And then this is a parameter that I'm passing over version for

677
01:41:02.190 --> 01:41:15.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: You can pass other parameters in addition to you, you'll always have self and then the master Candace to initialize initialize the UI, but then even have other things that come in or not.

678
01:41:16.710 --> 01:41:20.640
MS Analytics Class 2021: So I'm going to dial in here is a simple doing shall

679
01:41:22.110 --> 01:41:26.400
MS Analytics Class 2021: Specify the exact shape and size for the going

680
01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:30.180
MS Analytics Class 2021: 200 by 60 faces.

681
01:41:31.950 --> 01:41:43.350
MS Analytics Class 2021: This doing is basically the same as the other one. I wonder I'm just showing you that, okay, we can correct the size issues with that.

682
01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:47.010
MS Analytics Class 2021: And also,

683
01:41:48.750 --> 01:41:51.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: You have something called the language.

684
01:41:53.130 --> 01:41:54.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is just like the other one.

685
01:41:56.190 --> 01:42:00.390
MS Analytics Class 2021: So the only difference that is the size right here.

686
01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:06.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: And there's something old version coming in. So if I run this why

687
01:42:09.150 --> 01:42:20.040
MS Analytics Class 2021: Here. So you can see that on your screen. But you can see it has better proportions and saw crunched up and that's because of the size

688
01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:30.600
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now, right now it's 200 pixels wide and 16 tall. So I make this let's say foreigners why

689
01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:33.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: killed us and run this again.

690
01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:53.400
MS Analytics Class 2021: Then you see this much fear. Right. So we have direct control over the size of this thing. But if the user doesn't like your selection, they can always grab a corner and resize it in the normal way. Okay.

691
01:42:55.500 --> 01:43:03.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: So everything else here is a pretty much the same. I have a couple of comments in here, describing what these saints are doing

692
01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:09.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: But the only new thing here really is the challenger

693
01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:15.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let's open up example one be

694
01:43:21.690 --> 01:43:23.700
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, here we go.

695
01:43:25.590 --> 01:43:27.390
MS Analytics Class 2021: We may blow this up.

696
01:43:29.130 --> 01:43:30.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: By the way, there's some comments.

697
01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:41.730
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it says documentation, you can go to this this link and I'm going to drop it or just copy this here.

698
01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:45.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: And go to

699
01:43:47.010 --> 01:43:47.370
MS Analytics Class 2021: Well,

700
01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:14.010
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is this is legacy. The other sorts of documentation for patron.

701
01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:18.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: And this is the online documentation for bygone

702
01:44:20.040 --> 01:44:30.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: That you haven't seen this before you get to this by going to the documentation for bygone if you do a Google Docs.

703
01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:51.120
MS Analytics Class 2021: Notice that has the documentation for each version of bygone recent memory. And so three point 10 is the one that's a development 3.9 is the newest version that's stable. Right now we're looking at version on the documentation here free 1817

704
01:44:52.530 --> 01:44:56.310
MS Analytics Class 2021: The URL. This is doc stop five on the org

705
01:44:57.510 --> 01:44:59.100
MS Analytics Class 2021: So if you go to docs.

706
01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:02.850
MS Analytics Class 2021: On that order without anything else.

707
01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:07.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: You get to the latest version which is 391 documentation.

708
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:10.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: And

709
01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:18.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: If you want to go to another one you can jump to another one by just clicking here. There you go, 3.6

710
01:45:19.230 --> 01:45:24.930
MS Analytics Class 2021: And frequently going to find out what version you're running by looking at that and Bourbon

711
01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:48.780
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, back here to the now in this documentation you see here, you'll have some links to different things language reference for example library reference the gooey information is always another library around so I like a library reference

712
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:59.310
MS Analytics Class 2021: It says a five on standard library. And if you scroll down here bunch of stuff in standard library.

713
01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:03.150
MS Analytics Class 2021: Eventually,

714
01:46:04.350 --> 01:46:20.160
MS Analytics Class 2021: You're going to get to graphical user interface right there graphical user interfaces with TK is a standard bearer just every version of bile. Now that's unfortunate is okay.

715
01:46:21.450 --> 01:46:32.880
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you can go here to graphical user interfaces. Click on that and boom, you're right now I'm in the art of Python documentation or later today.

716
01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:37.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: Reading this is a little obscure and

717
01:46:38.670 --> 01:46:48.540
MS Analytics Class 2021: But if you're persistent, you can work your way through this. You can you can get a lot of information and there are some good examples in here.

718
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.500
MS Analytics Class 2021: That you can use

719
01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:10.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: Sort of the documentation. Now go back here to this school. We were in one day. And once every year. Now we're doing similar gooey, then we're doing a greeting.

720
01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:18.690
MS Analytics Class 2021: Nothing really. I don't see anything. Oh, I know what's going on. Let's run and say,

721
01:47:24.810 --> 01:47:25.680
MS Analytics Class 2021: Where do we go

722
01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:35.910
MS Analytics Class 2021: Eric

723
01:47:37.230 --> 01:47:40.530
MS Analytics Class 2021: Oh. Oh.

724
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:43.620
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

725
01:47:44.910 --> 01:48:04.350
MS Analytics Class 2021: There is an option to send the cursor. This is what's different and windows. Apparently, it doesn't like that option. So I'm going to go and to said pan that's the Tetris. A small small differences there. I wonder if you look at the documentation on

726
01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:09.660
MS Analytics Class 2021: Today, you know, see, and there is some back pain.

727
01:48:10.710 --> 01:48:13.020
MS Analytics Class 2021: So going to run this again.

728
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.970
MS Analytics Class 2021: Very

729
01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:18.270
MS Analytics Class 2021: And

730
01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:20.460
MS Analytics Class 2021: Again, yeah.

731
01:48:29.070 --> 01:48:38.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: You have to read research girl, sometimes you're doing the same site and job interviews. So you need to reset the URL.

732
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:41.490
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then

733
01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:47.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: You can see that is right.

734
01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:50.160
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now error messages.

735
01:48:51.900 --> 01:49:04.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: Were isn't we find this area, there is hiding. So this week is a little different. Notice that the label instead of being above above is to the left.

736
01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:17.640
MS Analytics Class 2021: And the violence of the right so this is clinic degree a degree. Notice that when I hover over the button. The hand comes up with the right thing, right.

737
01:49:18.420 --> 01:49:28.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: So I've done two things that are ever in the States. I sent the UI up so that the labels to the left of the box to the right. And I'm also set it up so that

738
01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:43.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: Remains cursor on to the button phone, something happens to alert the user that this, this is not a label is active. If you click on that something's going to happen. Okay.

739
01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:48.480
MS Analytics Class 2021: So let me move this out of the way here.

740
01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:55.050
MS Analytics Class 2021: Magic and move it onto the screen bring this back and now you bring the

741
01:49:57.060 --> 01:49:59.460
MS Analytics Class 2021: Summer going here. See that

742
01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:00.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: And now.

743
01:50:02.730 --> 01:50:06.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah. Howdy howdy howdy comes up in the right hand side.

744
01:50:07.290 --> 01:50:07.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: So what

745
01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:20.460
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, well, there is a brain grid option. Throw previously we just tend to like cameras and you started putting stuff on it.

746
01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:29.040
MS Analytics Class 2021: Will use pack feature to put us up on what happens when you do that, it is possible, one thing after another.

747
01:50:30.690 --> 01:50:38.730
MS Analytics Class 2021: Well, you don't want to do that. You want to be able to put stuff in different areas of your gooey. And so there is something called the grid.

748
01:50:39.870 --> 01:50:53.490
MS Analytics Class 2021: And the grid. The first of all, you're just creating great from you. And as you say self out mainframe or self that room or whatever you're calling the the gooey.

749
01:50:54.690 --> 01:50:58.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: When I instantiated. I use the UI when

750
01:51:00.090 --> 01:51:04.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: And I created this is actually creating the canvas. Right.

751
01:51:05.310 --> 01:51:08.940
MS Analytics Class 2021: But then I created a frame inside. Again, this

752
01:51:11.850 --> 01:51:19.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: Is this is what happens is you start with a blank canvas and instead of this island stuff on it.

753
01:51:20.250 --> 01:51:36.660
MS Analytics Class 2021: You create a grid and you put stuff within a grid. And if you want. You mean even take a part of the grid and make another group inside of that. So if you're getting really fancy

754
01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:46.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: You, your complicated gooey, you may want to not just have a simple for anything, but you may have one frame and then breaks within that

755
01:51:47.670 --> 01:52:10.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: Your master for you. They only have four cells to it and then you might decide, one of the cells to actually put another frame which is supported by offering or something like that. Now this is it says frame that grid column 000 meaning that one down one row. Okay.

756
01:52:11.340 --> 01:52:12.180
MS Analytics Class 2021: ROSIE. Rosie.

757
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:21.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: And this brain is going to go on mastery practice. Do we, when do we, when we set up right here.

758
01:52:23.670 --> 01:52:35.310
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now the label. Notice what happens here is still the same. It's going on the mainframe that instead of, instead of going on GMO. I went and saw it on mainframe, the frame.

759
01:52:36.900 --> 01:53:01.470
MS Analytics Class 2021: The text is green, and click degree. This is the label and the grid here is telling the program where to put the label, put it in the power of zero row on Facebook. So that was the left hand side column zero with your left hand column Rowan, you know, the next wrote down from zero

760
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:16.110
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then you have added, you can put around the x and the y axis I want 10 pixels in the exploration and 40 pixels in the water for that for that name. I want some space above

761
01:53:17.580 --> 01:53:26.940
MS Analytics Class 2021: And below and to the left and right. That's what that does. Now usually, we have to play around with that so that you can spacing right now.

762
01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:29.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: The next one is

763
01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:33.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: Not here you label on a green

764
01:53:35.220 --> 01:53:39.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: I use a person that that's what happened.

765
01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:48.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: And what's going to happen is, Eric. I'm so the bottom of the changes to him and lowers the user. Yeah.

766
01:53:50.190 --> 01:53:57.780
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then the commands itself that free will, that's pointing to the function. Read, write down in the press, how

767
01:53:59.490 --> 01:54:09.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then, just like with a label you can position where you want to go. So it says position is called one that's the right hand excellent over

768
01:54:11.310 --> 01:54:13.680
MS Analytics Class 2021: And Rwanda Saint rose label.

769
01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:21.840
MS Analytics Class 2021: Say man came for x and y. Okay, so

770
01:54:24.690 --> 01:54:29.340
MS Analytics Class 2021: There is so you can see many mess around the label here.

771
01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:46.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: There is the 20th a wide direction and then the button whitewash is approximately 20 in the y direction up and then on the exploration on the inside and you can change those numbers to move these spots around anywhere you want.

772
01:54:48.210 --> 01:55:06.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: You can basically put the label and but anywhere you want on the canvas based by deciding what column and row you want to use. And this is where we're imagining a frame that has one row two columns that said

773
01:55:08.670 --> 01:55:09.390
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

774
01:55:11.490 --> 01:55:19.290
MS Analytics Class 2021: We kill it all. Now let's go to yes one car. It is. See what happens there.

775
01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:24.840
MS Analytics Class 2021: One see right here.

776
01:55:26.250 --> 01:55:29.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: And boom, there we go. And we're going to make the spear.

777
01:55:32.250 --> 01:55:44.550
MS Analytics Class 2021: OK, notice we're doing something a little different here. Notice the import. I gotta do him more here and more to tinker, tinker, message box.

778
01:55:45.540 --> 01:55:59.760
MS Analytics Class 2021: So there is a class within dangerous danger that has the message boxes and we're going to end more to have one ball show info and another one called show warning.

779
01:56:00.540 --> 01:56:19.830
MS Analytics Class 2021: So these are your message boxes that are available to anybody is making a gooey. And what happens is you can have your Bible triggered open a message box. It's like a pop and then you can put information or other features inside that pop. So let's see what happens here.

780
01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:25.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: First, I'm going to reset the current

781
01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.690
MS Analytics Class 2021: Restart because it still has information from the other program.

782
01:56:31.890 --> 01:56:34.110
MS Analytics Class 2021: Running. There we go.

783
01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:40.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: All right. Well, let's see.

784
01:56:41.250 --> 01:56:59.070
MS Analytics Class 2021: See if we can figure out what's going on here. So, so far today is pretty much the same. Notice that we're using the same grid framework we're using the same column and row. So all of this with a label and the button or the same

785
01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:04.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then I have something funny going on down here.

786
01:57:08.370 --> 01:57:18.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: But what's happening is it's looking at the grid over and over again to see if anything's changed for child in the mainframe.

787
01:57:20.190 --> 01:57:29.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: So it's actually sitting here going through this loop looking to say that they press the button. The button press yet. No. Okay, so again,

788
01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:32.070
MS Analytics Class 2021: And

789
01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:37.140
MS Analytics Class 2021: Then, this has something called the green button.

790
01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:41.070
MS Analytics Class 2021: The green button is

791
01:57:42.900 --> 01:57:43.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: Shane.

792
01:57:44.910 --> 01:57:46.170
MS Analytics Class 2021: Right up here.

793
01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:52.620
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is the green button right there. The lead label you read the Bible and agreed upon.

794
01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:58.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so it's the mainframe is sitting there watching that.

795
01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:06.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: And if in bed by the suppressed, it goes off to the assumption for free.

796
01:58:08.250 --> 01:58:25.920
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it looks at that variable called VR it be yours friend. It just prints pop up here. If it's it's going to put a warning, Baba. If it's window is going to put up a another wi n window.

797
01:58:27.150 --> 01:58:32.010
MS Analytics Class 2021: So let's see. Let's see. So right now this program to throw up a window.

798
01:58:33.900 --> 01:58:41.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: You'll notice here, it says rude version window. So let's see what happens. I'm reading this run

799
01:58:46.260 --> 01:58:50.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: Oh, it doesn't like that cursor. And so I've got to change that.

800
01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:58.590
MS Analytics Class 2021: lane change that the hand to

801
01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:02.700
MS Analytics Class 2021: The right again.

802
01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:06.300
Right.

803
01:59:12.300 --> 01:59:14.910
MS Analytics Class 2021: There, I think this is it right here.

804
01:59:17.190 --> 01:59:20.370
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then I hit greeting. Yeah, see the box.

805
01:59:21.450 --> 01:59:29.970
MS Analytics Class 2021: So now I agree, I get a pop up and so printing out the greeting on the right hand side, I get a bottom of the screen.

806
01:59:31.590 --> 01:59:44.010
MS Analytics Class 2021: Of course, if you're running this movie by itself and not inside the spider. This is what you want to do, because the person is running people is not going to see the output window.

807
01:59:44.850 --> 01:59:59.160
MS Analytics Class 2021: They will see a pop up on the screen. Another way to do this is that actually right inside the going like somewhere in here, right. The word howdy, but I wanted to show you this is a real easy thing to do.

808
02:00:00.570 --> 02:00:03.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: And various new

809
02:00:06.690 --> 02:00:07.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

810
02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:11.130
All right.

811
02:00:12.690 --> 02:00:23.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let's take a 10 minute break. And when we do your that can this program into the week one area. So if you haven't run these

812
02:00:24.030 --> 02:00:36.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: We can, you know, you can have these Bible and then we're going to get on to the more serious discussion about building a gooey that gets real nice soccer aces real

813
02:00:37.710 --> 02:00:48.570
MS Analytics Class 2021: Exchange rates and things like that. Okay, so this is this is, it's easy to do the alley thing, but we can do way more than that because Python is on the Internet.

814
02:00:49.170 --> 02:00:59.880
MS Analytics Class 2021: So by by can go out and grab the current price of IBM or the current exchange rate for basis and then calculate how many dollars, you should get for your

815
02:01:01.140 --> 02:01:02.460
MS Analytics Class 2021: Your purchase.

816
02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:04.110
Okay.

817
02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:08.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: All right, see like a 01

818
02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:18.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then they had the next line main URL base URL everything good so this URL is huge.

819
02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:29.520
MS Analytics Class 2021: The base URL doesn't change. But the other part like the from currency, the tomb currency and the API key, they can all change right

820
02:01:31.740 --> 02:01:44.250
MS Analytics Class 2021: So, and then basically the next next option says request object equals request yet main URL that function goes out to the internet.

821
02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:55.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: So when you run this, you need to be connected to the Internet, right. And what's going to happen here is this function should send the signal out on the internet to

822
02:01:56.160 --> 02:02:07.470
MS Analytics Class 2021: The alpha advantage folks and says give me the exchange rate for pesos. In this case, it's actually program to get into the exchange rate for again Japanese

823
02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:18.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then it says resolved people that result is going to be the JSON object, the JSON object gets returned. Notice it says, Doc, Jason.

824
02:02:18.900 --> 02:02:30.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then the exchange rate of the JSON object is like a dictionary. So in order to pull out the exchange rate, you have the result. And then you index it.

825
02:02:31.410 --> 02:02:48.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: By two will call keys dictionary keys that pretty JSON object because it's a dictionary here and then return floating point exchange rate and the full JSON string the result.

826
02:02:49.350 --> 02:03:02.370
MS Analytics Class 2021: The key of the API key here is now it turns out that if you're looking for information about the end. You don't need to just put in the word demo. So this is great for testing your code, right.

827
02:03:03.420 --> 02:03:08.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then you then you've all that you can see right below you call the exchange that function.

828
02:03:09.240 --> 02:03:24.600
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then it will after that it will return the result and print out the result there at the bottom. Now I'm going to try to run this, but this computer is not talking to the internet. We got a problem. Let's see what happens. So I couldn't run

829
02:03:26.970 --> 02:03:33.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: It works. We know right over here on the right hand side. So this computer is

830
02:03:35.010 --> 02:03:40.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: Good. Let me blow this up so you can see it on. Well, what the heck. Why, why they're doing

831
02:03:42.930 --> 02:03:45.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, I don't know if you can see that right here.

832
02:03:47.370 --> 02:03:50.730
MS Analytics Class 2021: But it says real time currency exchange rate.

833
02:03:51.960 --> 02:04:02.340
MS Analytics Class 2021: For us and our the Japanese yen is 103.76776 right let me run again.

834
02:04:05.580 --> 02:04:08.010
MS Analytics Class 2021: What are three by 771

835
02:04:09.090 --> 02:04:10.560
MS Analytics Class 2021: So this is real time.

836
02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:22.680
MS Analytics Class 2021: Scoring out of the Internet and grabbing the real time rate for currency exchange between the dollar in the end. Now, if you have a proper API key.

837
02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:31.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: And I'll show you where you can find one. You can use my key or you can go to the website. It's around key.

838
02:04:32.430 --> 02:04:51.180
MS Analytics Class 2021: It's your choice. If you go to alpha advantage that CEO, there's some information in here that tell you how to get your own key. But if you are fine with it. I'm fine with it. You can use likely Mikey is set up to be good till the end of the year.

839
02:04:52.410 --> 02:05:00.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: And maybe beyond, who knows, I don't know, they kind of like, am I don't know why. So we haven't got that far yet.

840
02:05:00.570 --> 02:05:23.490
MS Analytics Class 2021: So that function is what's going on. So let's uh, let's go to example free here. And if you go down into example three you'll see my tea right here it says API key that guy line 52. That's my tip that's good for anything. Let's copy that will

841
02:05:27.540 --> 02:05:37.620
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let's copy that bring over to that other example API key copy, go back to example to and right after demo.

842
02:05:39.060 --> 02:05:40.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let's put there.

843
02:05:42.210 --> 02:05:44.400
MS Analytics Class 2021: And let's run that

844
02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:47.250
MS Analytics Class 2021: Make sure it works.

845
02:05:49.050 --> 02:06:00.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah, it got it. The end is a little different. Darren 3.768. Now let's go instead of going JP wide. So the MX and

846
02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:20.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: They saw my face. Oh, that's our mo. What is the pace of doing today. Let's run it, see if we get reformation Mexican pesos 19.62 okay

847
02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:26.490
MS Analytics Class 2021: That's good for Mexico language for the tourists. Okay.

848
02:06:27.690 --> 02:06:36.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: At one point, a few months ago, the face. It was like $1. But it was worth about 24 pixels and now they have recovered.

849
02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:44.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: Most of that damage that was, that was the damage that happen within the virus research amounts and so forth and so

850
02:06:45.450 --> 02:07:08.160
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now their economy is is coming back and they're doing well, they're kind of in Mexico is driven primarily by the oil prices, by the way. And so, as all prices go up the pace of stabilizes so prices going down basis not so good. So right now, $1 is worth 19.62 bases.

851
02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:22.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: All right, see how that works. If you have another currency, you'd like to use besides facials instead of an accent What is she was a Europe. So the, er, you are you are you are is that the euro.

852
02:07:23.460 --> 02:07:24.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let's, let's run

853
02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:27.900
Jim Clark: His car. Yeah.

854
02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:32.010
MS Analytics Class 2021: So $1 is point eight euros.

855
02:07:33.390 --> 02:07:35.790
MS Analytics Class 2021: Not so good at ca

856
02:07:39.660 --> 02:07:48.480
MS Analytics Class 2021: Is guess what our favorite neighbor Canada that $1 us is 1.27 Canadian

857
02:07:49.740 --> 02:07:52.020
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah okay you drag that

858
02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:59.880
MS Analytics Class 2021: So let's put this in the app. Let's put this in a gooey and in the gooey, really, we're gonna let you set up your

859
02:08:01.110 --> 02:08:03.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: Your currency and all that sort of thing.

860
02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:07.890
MS Analytics Class 2021: Alright, so let's go to example three right here.

861
02:08:09.060 --> 02:08:13.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: You can open up on me exploded, a little bit.

862
02:08:15.420 --> 02:08:17.280
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is the example for a

863
02:08:22.650 --> 02:08:23.730
MS Analytics Class 2021: 24 hour

864
02:08:29.820 --> 02:08:45.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, so let's see what we got here. This is a bigger example, the title of the EU is currency exchange. And when you call the doing from your code, you're going to pass in the master canvas for UI when

865
02:08:46.890 --> 02:08:53.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: You're going to pass in the from currency string like MX like USD dollars.

866
02:08:54.690 --> 02:09:13.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then the two currency, like in that's interfaces and your API here at the bottom at the end. Okay. And then, of course, it creates that now here's the frame is going up. And this is going to be the more complicated. It's the most complicated example.

867
02:09:14.550 --> 02:09:16.350
MS Analytics Class 2021: Because you have several different

868
02:09:18.090 --> 02:09:25.500
MS Analytics Class 2021: See, the thing that says cursor can make that happen to if you're on a Mac pad is fine, but when I was saying.

869
02:09:31.650 --> 02:09:34.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: And you can see the API key is down here.

870
02:09:41.670 --> 02:09:47.970
MS Analytics Class 2021: The currency exchange that function we're just looking at is right here currency exchange rate.

871
02:09:49.650 --> 02:09:52.110
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then there's one called show conversion

872
02:09:53.670 --> 02:10:01.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: And here's a there's a simple program that calls it, it says instantiate doing Canvas using TK

873
02:10:02.550 --> 02:10:06.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now, right now it's set up to use a VPN $2

874
02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:10.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it's using the API key demo.

875
02:10:13.980 --> 02:10:16.500
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let's run this and see what happens.

876
02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:19.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: So,

877
02:10:23.850 --> 02:10:24.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

878
02:10:25.830 --> 02:10:26.850
MS Analytics Class 2021: So here's the good

879
02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:44.100
MS Analytics Class 2021: So in this case, you can put in. How many yen. Do you want to spend in the little box of there and then it should come back, you will that's worth $1 so let's put in 100 yen like that.

880
02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:49.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: Japanese and then click on convert

881
02:10:51.270 --> 02:11:02.250
MS Analytics Class 2021: Oh, papa point nine $6 one hand right now is approximately one penny. So that's what I'm saying here.

882
02:11:03.510 --> 02:11:04.170
MS Analytics Class 2021: Right.

883
02:11:06.210 --> 02:11:07.890
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, so that's

884
02:11:09.090 --> 02:11:10.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: That's one example three is doing.

885
02:11:12.630 --> 02:11:13.350
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now,

886
02:11:14.550 --> 02:11:16.560
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let's pull this part. Well, I mean,

887
02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:21.570
MS Analytics Class 2021: I shouldn't kill them. Okay, here is the here's the gooey.

888
02:11:23.250 --> 02:11:29.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so I'm going to put this someplace where we can see it. You can see how it's being set up right

889
02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:40.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: So the name of this movie is called currency exchange.

890
02:11:42.420 --> 02:11:55.320
MS Analytics Class 2021: There is one row two rows three rows. See that. So we set the frame up to have three rows bank BAG. BAG. Now you're going to do a good. What you want to do is get a napkin.

891
02:11:56.130 --> 02:12:06.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: And draw a rectangle or something like that. And then all that rectangle, put the characteristics that you want to have in the gooey. Now, this would be things like

892
02:12:07.470 --> 02:12:16.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: Things that you want the person to enter this space where you get free, the number of yen. So I have a box there. And so for that, it's accepting the number of the end

893
02:12:18.330 --> 02:12:34.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: And I have an area where I'm going to display the dollars that are being calculated that's going to be good. And then the bottom that actually triggers the conversion right three rows and it looks like two or three columns.

894
02:12:35.730 --> 02:12:40.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let's see how this is actually set up in the code. So looking at the code.

895
02:12:44.490 --> 02:12:47.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: You can see that is quite a bit larger. Right.

896
02:12:48.930 --> 02:12:49.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: However,

897
02:12:52.020 --> 02:13:09.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: No support here should look very familiar by now we just went through three different examples of this. So should be like yeah okay file currency exchange. Yeah, that's going to go a little side on the top of the, of the, the, the going

898
02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:17.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: From currency. I created my own internal copy of the currency, the currency and the API p

899
02:13:18.870 --> 02:13:33.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: S me in passing, when you call them going, but different people will call the UI and use different currencies or different API's. So you have to capture that in it. And that's why you have a cell phone operator coming in right here.

900
02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:36.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: Creative brain.

901
02:13:37.710 --> 02:13:49.860
MS Analytics Class 2021: So we just instantiate the brain and we're going to put a little bit boundary around three pixels in the S S direction and 12 pixels in the y direction.

902
02:13:50.940 --> 02:14:02.790
MS Analytics Class 2021: That's what you're seeing it. So, otherwise it will try to put stuff right up to the boundary of the gooey and it won't look good. So you want a little bit of bedding.

903
02:14:04.710 --> 02:14:13.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then this is the grid 00 sticky north west, east, south this controls.

904
02:14:14.490 --> 02:14:18.390
MS Analytics Class 2021: The order in which the objects are being put in the frame.

905
02:14:19.590 --> 02:14:36.150
MS Analytics Class 2021: North be stop West that'll be the first W first position in the brain upper left hand corner. And then the last position will be east, south. So if you look at the box.

906
02:14:40.530 --> 02:14:42.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: I guess we all grow Gordon.

907
02:14:43.260 --> 02:14:43.650
Okay.

908
02:14:45.540 --> 02:14:54.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: If you think of the box, the upper left hand corner, which is basically northwest and the bottom right hand corner is basically selfies and

909
02:14:56.820 --> 02:15:03.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: Then you say over the car figure have a wage, it's a standard way to one.

910
02:15:06.210 --> 02:15:09.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: The from exchange rate is a string variable.

911
02:15:11.820 --> 02:15:17.970
MS Analytics Class 2021: Where's this coming from. It's coming from the variable FS from and

912
02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:21.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: Ethics FX fun was that string variable.

913
02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:35.280
MS Analytics Class 2021: So this is the open box. Remember the open box where you actually not not the open boxes is the yeah this is the, the amount of yen.

914
02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:48.570
MS Analytics Class 2021: That's that's coming in there. And so it's coming in as a strength. So you'd like 100. And the reason it doesn't come in as the number 100 comes in as a straight 100

915
02:15:50.370 --> 02:15:52.860
MS Analytics Class 2021: So that's the end from we're coming in.

916
02:15:54.180 --> 02:15:58.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: From the entry and this is Australia where it's located

917
02:16:00.060 --> 02:16:02.040
MS Analytics Class 2021: How to row one.

918
02:16:04.020 --> 02:16:05.280
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, so

919
02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:12.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: Called to be here and then this is row one road to recovery.

920
02:16:22.650 --> 02:16:36.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you get an idea what he sees our best work with them this CD business is something that's always confuses me a little bit. It's basically describing. Okay, you're going to, you're going to go on a column to Roku

921
02:16:37.800 --> 02:16:48.180
MS Analytics Class 2021: There's box there where you want to go in that box west, east meaning Middle. Middle. The middle one of the box.

922
02:16:49.620 --> 02:16:52.590
MS Analytics Class 2021: Status sticky equals west, east me in the middle line.

923
02:16:55.260 --> 02:17:00.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: Here's one column three row three. This is the Convert button.

924
02:17:01.980 --> 02:17:09.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: And we want this to be West, which means we wanted to be left left justified know

925
02:17:10.860 --> 02:17:19.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: They could use left brain justified and all that sort of thing. But somebody thought it would be better to use the site and compass.

926
02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:21.750
And

927
02:17:23.490 --> 02:17:35.850
MS Analytics Class 2021: Then, one of the things that is a little awkward here is we have the word the yen actually programmed into the UI itself. So we probably should change that.

928
02:17:37.050 --> 02:17:43.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: So that they can get labeled properly. So when you run this program.

929
02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:52.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: You'll see the GN comes up their dollars. Thumbs up here. These are hardwired into the into the going

930
02:17:56.010 --> 02:17:56.550
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

931
02:18:06.690 --> 02:18:10.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, so that's that's example three

932
02:18:11.430 --> 02:18:13.170
MS Analytics Class 2021: Questions about example three

933
02:18:18.180 --> 02:18:19.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: Scene. We were okay

934
02:18:20.430 --> 02:18:21.120
Swanson J, Charles Richard: We're okay.

935
02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:38.790
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, good blow this up.

936
02:18:45.330 --> 02:18:46.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is

937
02:18:48.690 --> 02:18:49.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let's see, what did we go

938
02:18:53.010 --> 02:18:53.940
MS Analytics Class 2021: Oh, okay.

939
02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:22.020
MS Analytics Class 2021: Different at all.

940
02:19:44.550 --> 02:20:04.320
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, so an example for is, is you have you have the information of the conversion coming right up here inside of the gooey and also you have the there's a pipe in the upper window, you have a full description of the same information.

941
02:20:07.410 --> 02:20:07.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

942
02:20:43.980 --> 02:20:44.400
MS Analytics Class 2021: Is

943
02:20:45.960 --> 02:21:00.660
MS Analytics Class 2021: Just go back and look at the book decide whether you want to purchase a drone. If you do by go ahead perky get online. You can you can find the store per day should be. He is the GI

944
02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:06.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: But this is the part that I want to mention number five.

945
02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:10.620
MS Analytics Class 2021: Number five. That's the part of own talk about

946
02:21:13.020 --> 02:21:16.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: Using the the TK code.

947
02:21:17.970 --> 02:21:25.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: That we just talked about, that would be example three and four develop your own UI or reporting real time sock race.

948
02:21:27.570 --> 02:21:33.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: The UI should allow the user to enter the symbol of the stock, such as IBM

949
02:21:35.970 --> 02:21:39.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then the Bible with the label price instead of good convert

950
02:21:43.170 --> 02:21:52.020
MS Analytics Class 2021: You should be able to report the current asking price and start writing the current price in the gooey when the bible displays.

951
02:21:53.760 --> 02:21:57.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: Look at the documentation to improve the look of you're doing once you get it running

952
02:22:02.340 --> 02:22:15.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: It says here know you and use it should say, you can use the API key demo for IBM, but any other stock will require your own key or Mikey

953
02:22:16.170 --> 02:22:19.500
MS Analytics Class 2021: Feel free to use like a. You can also get your own if you want

954
02:22:22.230 --> 02:22:24.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: So let's go, let's go back.

955
02:22:26.700 --> 02:22:27.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: And

956
02:22:29.340 --> 02:22:30.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: Take a look at

957
02:22:33.450 --> 02:22:34.050
MS Analytics Class 2021: Exactly.

958
02:23:10.170 --> 02:23:12.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: Spiders, and like me you're being

959
02:23:14.190 --> 02:23:16.110
MS Analytics Class 2021: Stuck on one street another

960
02:23:27.480 --> 02:23:39.660
6 Aldin Dollens Laptop: So you might try maybe moving the application or window. You're trying to move like move it down and over. It's possible that the alignment of the two monitors isn't letting you do it.

961
02:23:40.830 --> 02:23:41.700
6 Aldin Dollens Laptop: Something like that.

962
02:23:43.740 --> 02:23:44.160
MS Analytics Class 2021: Like a

963
02:23:48.780 --> 02:24:01.830
MS Analytics Class 2021: Mother. Oh, I see it says there's a scale change, you know, the monitor that you're seeing is a different scale. So what I'm going to do just shut it down, come over here and

964
02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:06.180
MS Analytics Class 2021: Research Center.

965
02:24:08.910 --> 02:24:16.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: Whatever. Yeah, so the monster. You're looking at the race. Lot of larger than a little bitty monster on the left.

966
02:24:28.770 --> 02:24:29.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: Please.

967
02:24:44.220 --> 02:24:45.270
MS Analytics Class 2021: don't usually do this.

968
02:25:13.980 --> 02:25:26.520
MS Analytics Class 2021: Example for and what I would do first of all is I go File, Save a copy. Yes. And we're going to call this week one.

969
02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:31.860
MS Analytics Class 2021: You know, you got anything you want. I

970
02:25:34.050 --> 02:25:38.550
MS Analytics Class 2021: I suppose. Maybe we should thought soccer ice.

971
02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:41.340
MS Analytics Class 2021: That way.

972
02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:47.940
MS Analytics Class 2021: It'll ring a bell about what what this is supposed to be doing when you agree.

973
02:25:54.900 --> 02:25:55.860
MS Analytics Class 2021: Description

974
02:26:00.570 --> 02:26:01.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah.

975
02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:08.100
MS Analytics Class 2021: Real time

976
02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:23.760
MS Analytics Class 2021: Real Time currency exchange rate. Let's change the

977
02:26:25.230 --> 02:26:27.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: Name of the song option to

978
02:26:28.620 --> 02:26:30.780
MS Analytics Class 2021: Real Time soccer's

979
02:26:41.010 --> 02:26:42.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: In this case,

980
02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:46.140
MS Analytics Class 2021: The only thing he really

981
02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:51.540
MS Analytics Class 2021: Is the stock so

982
02:26:53.370 --> 02:27:05.070
MS Analytics Class 2021: That's gonna be a freeloader usually it's a three letter acronym like I am for the stock big for bitcoin, it's also in the exchange.

983
02:27:07.530 --> 02:27:26.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now here's the problem, the URLs going to need to be changed the base URL apparently says function equals currency exchange rate. Hmm. We are going to have to change this part of the code. What should we do well.

984
02:27:28.170 --> 02:27:31.320
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let's go to a browser.

985
02:27:34.200 --> 02:27:35.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: And

986
02:27:40.830 --> 02:27:42.300
MS Analytics Class 2021: And let's go to

987
02:27:43.860 --> 02:27:45.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: The website.

988
02:27:47.730 --> 02:27:49.530
MS Analytics Class 2021: So that would be

989
02:27:53.730 --> 02:27:56.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: What, what is it called again.

990
02:27:58.680 --> 02:28:02.310
MS Analytics Class 2021: It's called the advantage that co right there.

991
02:28:03.330 --> 02:28:05.070
MS Analytics Class 2021: So I'm just going to copy that part of

992
02:28:08.070 --> 02:28:09.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: The part of the deal.

993
02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:12.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: With that

994
02:28:14.790 --> 02:28:26.040
MS Analytics Class 2021: Return. So here's the company. We've been we've been working with. It's called alpha advantage you see down here at the bottom right, it says, get your free API key today.

995
02:28:28.230 --> 02:28:30.540
MS Analytics Class 2021: You shouldn't be afraid of anything says free

996
02:28:32.160 --> 02:28:36.540
MS Analytics Class 2021: It's, it's free for a limited use, but if you get

997
02:28:38.010 --> 02:28:48.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: Get to use it on a practical basis, you have to pay money okay this is a business. We have a game. We don't need to get that. But you can get one if you want

998
02:28:48.480 --> 02:28:58.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: To see what happens. And these are the sort of things that you can use. You can get stock prices AP eyes, you can get comfortable currency information.

999
02:28:59.670 --> 02:29:05.850
MS Analytics Class 2021: goal conversion for currency rates and things like that documentation is up here, right.

1000
02:29:06.870 --> 02:29:09.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: Spreadsheets jobs.

1001
02:29:11.850 --> 02:29:12.780
MS Analytics Class 2021: Jobs.

1002
02:29:16.110 --> 02:29:17.910
MS Analytics Class 2021: Software engineer.

1003
02:29:19.890 --> 02:29:20.880
MS Analytics Class 2021: Developer

1004
02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:25.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: Were good

1005
02:29:43.980 --> 02:29:44.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: What

1006
02:29:45.210 --> 02:29:46.260
6 Aldin Dollens Laptop: Or telecommute

1007
02:29:46.740 --> 02:29:47.370
Yeah.

1008
02:29:48.420 --> 02:29:49.590
6 Aldin Dollens Laptop: I like Boston

1009
02:29:51.210 --> 02:29:51.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: You

1010
02:29:52.650 --> 02:29:56.310
MS Analytics Class 2021: Know the word snow. That's one of the documentation.

1011
02:29:58.230 --> 02:30:00.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is where we're going to find the information we need.

1012
02:30:02.160 --> 02:30:06.390
MS Analytics Class 2021: If you look at CES stock time series.

1013
02:30:08.040 --> 02:30:16.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: Fundamental data, you can get you can get information on the company, things like the balance sheet, cash flow. See all that information together.

1014
02:30:17.430 --> 02:30:40.290
MS Analytics Class 2021: A lot. There are a lot of companies basically feel this and they sell a gooey to provide investors information right there's nothing stopping you from doing the same thing. He wanted to create a gooey that allow investors to investigate a company and what they wanted. So that I shot.

1015
02:30:41.490 --> 02:30:44.640
MS Analytics Class 2021: Here you go. You got the information you can use to build that going

1016
02:30:48.210 --> 02:30:48.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now,

1017
02:30:50.400 --> 02:30:52.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: cryptocurrencies who

1018
02:30:55.080 --> 02:31:01.170
MS Analytics Class 2021: The security of your own a crypto currencies as well. If you do it like to talk to you about that.

1019
02:31:04.800 --> 02:31:22.500
MS Analytics Class 2021: Right. And here we have technical indicators, lots of technical indicators. So you're wanting to know the current Del Rey because right now the market is shut down but you know they have all sorts of. So here we go. Stock fundamental there.

1020
02:31:24.690 --> 02:31:40.320
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is the these are the exchange rates. This is where we got the information on pesos and so forth. The exchange rates and we're getting. I think the intraday which is the instantaneous right now exchange rate.

1021
02:31:42.510 --> 02:31:53.940
MS Analytics Class 2021: And but I want some stock information. So let's get the intraday stock. Now, this is, this will be the stock race right now. Yeah.

1022
02:31:55.080 --> 02:32:08.070
MS Analytics Class 2021: On the market and you could get of course a daily or daily adjusted weekly, monthly, quarterly, and so forth. It's not as as high usage, which means a lot of people are using this particular fee.

1023
02:32:09.120 --> 02:32:18.780
MS Analytics Class 2021: The daily adjusted they're using that P and so forth. So let's take a look at this little intraday the right here. You click on that.

1024
02:32:19.980 --> 02:32:26.850
MS Analytics Class 2021: And here it gives us some informations about what we want to do. Whoops.

1025
02:32:31.050 --> 02:32:31.560
MS Analytics Class 2021: Alright.

1026
02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:50.040
MS Analytics Class 2021: The API this API returns the intraday time series of the equity specify covering extended trading hours 4am to 8pm eastern time in the US market.

1027
02:32:51.660 --> 02:33:05.340
MS Analytics Class 2021: I suppose for other markets. Other stocks market to really wouldn't be different, but it's what it's doing here. Now, here are the required API parameters. Some of the required, and some of them are optional.

1028
02:33:06.690 --> 02:33:18.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: So require time series of your choice in this case time series intraday. So remember we had currencies that base URL with the currency exchange rate.

1029
02:33:20.010 --> 02:33:23.790
MS Analytics Class 2021: Replace that function equal time series intraday

1030
02:33:25.620 --> 02:33:27.600
MS Analytics Class 2021: Also reward symbol.

1031
02:33:28.980 --> 02:33:32.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: Such as symbol equals IBM

1032
02:33:33.690 --> 02:33:48.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: Read what's required interval another parameter one minute by minute 15 minute. How often do you want to get this value you're getting the time series here.

1033
02:33:51.840 --> 02:33:52.380
Oops.

1034
02:33:54.180 --> 02:34:03.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you could get for example these price every one minute for today. If you wanted

1035
02:34:04.800 --> 02:34:08.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: Optional as Justin true or false.

1036
02:34:11.100 --> 02:34:15.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is adjusted by things like dividends.

1037
02:34:17.340 --> 02:34:23.340
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so normally you would say false because you're going, you don't get the the

1038
02:34:24.660 --> 02:34:27.600
MS Analytics Class 2021: Depot. By default, adjusting is true.

1039
02:34:29.940 --> 02:34:35.850
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, so I will probably take adjusted Eagle false output size.

1040
02:34:37.500 --> 02:34:39.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: Strange Scott back or four

1041
02:34:42.150 --> 02:34:50.040
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you have to consider what up, what size you want data type Jason and CSV CSE

1042
02:34:51.360 --> 02:34:52.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: Are both allow

1043
02:34:53.910 --> 02:34:56.880
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then you have your API key now.

1044
02:34:58.050 --> 02:35:01.500
MS Analytics Class 2021: Here are some examples you can see click for Jason

1045
02:35:05.010 --> 02:35:07.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you can see what the URL should look like.

1046
02:35:09.810 --> 02:35:14.010
MS Analytics Class 2021: The top URL is where IBM

1047
02:35:15.090 --> 02:35:22.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: The interval is five minutes. And since this is IBM, you can use the demo is your API key.

1048
02:35:24.360 --> 02:35:25.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: The next one.

1049
02:35:27.120 --> 02:35:27.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: Is

1050
02:35:29.490 --> 02:35:48.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: IBM again in five minutes output for API key demo. So I'm not sure what the differences in the output size for Cisco back, you know, that kind of thing. So you're going out to play with this a little bit to see what is being provided.

1051
02:35:50.460 --> 02:35:51.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: And

1052
02:35:55.260 --> 02:36:01.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now you can also get it for a day, which is extended history. I don't think you want that.

1053
02:36:04.770 --> 02:36:05.640
MS Analytics Class 2021: Daily

1054
02:36:07.710 --> 02:36:09.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: Time. Sure you daily

1055
02:36:12.090 --> 02:36:13.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: This would be over a period of

1056
02:36:20.460 --> 02:36:21.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: The CPI is

1057
02:36:23.220 --> 02:36:24.660
MS Analytics Class 2021: The link time

1058
02:36:40.530 --> 02:36:48.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, so I think your main challenge here from what I'm looking at is if you're going to use it today.

1059
02:36:50.010 --> 02:36:50.940
MS Analytics Class 2021: Is trying to

1060
02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:55.530
MS Analytics Class 2021: Find out what it is. If you want, you

1061
02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:27.690
MS Analytics Class 2021: You have complete freedom in what you do and this is doing. For example, you might want to just report the High Noon price.

1062
02:37:28.050 --> 02:37:40.140
MS Analytics Class 2021: Or you might want to report the maximum price during the day or the minimum price or the average price over a period of time, you have complete freedom in this assignment to do whatever you'd like.

1063
02:37:40.950 --> 02:37:48.660
MS Analytics Class 2021: I think the easiest thing to do is probably to take one of these cases and look at what's actually return

1064
02:37:50.040 --> 02:37:54.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: So if I click here, you can see what's being return

1065
02:37:56.910 --> 02:38:07.680
MS Analytics Class 2021: So this is the open high low close races and violence for IBM January 15 looks like.

1066
02:38:09.270 --> 02:38:11.760
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so it's not that's

1067
02:38:13.800 --> 02:38:25.470
MS Analytics Class 2021: Not exactly current, but this is a demo where you can use your own API, it'll show you more. So this is, this is what's coming out when you use that one format.

1068
02:38:27.660 --> 02:38:28.830
MS Analytics Class 2021: You might want to

1069
02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:31.680
MS Analytics Class 2021: Get

1070
02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:33.150
MS Analytics Class 2021: To

1071
02:38:34.890 --> 02:38:35.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: Three o'clock.

1072
02:38:45.690 --> 02:38:47.730
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let's see, what else is provided here.

1073
02:38:57.120 --> 02:38:57.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay.

1074
02:38:59.790 --> 02:39:00.540
MS Analytics Class 2021: So,

1075
02:39:01.980 --> 02:39:14.700
MS Analytics Class 2021: I really haven't studied this that closely, but see your, feel free to create an app that does whatever you like it. Okay, but report some characteristic of the stock value.

1076
02:39:15.990 --> 02:39:19.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: For IBM or any other stock that you might put in

1077
02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:23.790
MS Analytics Class 2021: Now once you figure this out.

1078
02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:40.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: Then it's all just a matter of changing this base URL and the main URL to conform to what they're using back there and

1079
02:39:42.150 --> 02:39:44.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: Here you're getting the result in Jason

1080
02:39:45.390 --> 02:39:47.370
MS Analytics Class 2021: And you notice right here.

1081
02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:58.320
MS Analytics Class 2021: The information. This is targeting the exchange rate. So if you look at the JSON string.

1082
02:39:59.580 --> 02:40:02.640
MS Analytics Class 2021: Which is over, looking at here just earlier see

1083
02:40:09.690 --> 02:40:16.110
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is Jason stream right here. So in a century, there was number five was the conversion rate.

1084
02:40:21.540 --> 02:40:22.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: In this case,

1085
02:40:23.850 --> 02:40:25.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: Number five is vine.

1086
02:40:28.740 --> 02:40:32.490
MS Analytics Class 2021: And number one is open, high, low, close

1087
02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:43.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: So this is every five minutes. So it's basically saying that between 735 and 745

1088
02:40:45.330 --> 02:40:51.930
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is the statistics are that data, the high and low, the same

1089
02:40:53.250 --> 02:40:55.170
MS Analytics Class 2021: Over five minutes didn't change that much.

1090
02:40:56.190 --> 02:41:00.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then they close the same and they all say buy 300

1091
02:41:02.850 --> 02:41:03.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: So,

1092
02:41:06.780 --> 02:41:11.970
MS Analytics Class 2021: I don't know how many of us trade sock that I would probably report the volume.

1093
02:41:13.290 --> 02:41:14.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then

1094
02:41:16.170 --> 02:41:17.730
MS Analytics Class 2021: The clothes.

1095
02:41:20.880 --> 02:41:21.600
MS Analytics Class 2021: Price.

1096
02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:37.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: For that for the time interval. And you may want agree, some statistics here and you know this this this particular date and that came back you can see it starts at seven o'clock in the morning.

1097
02:41:38.790 --> 02:41:42.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: And goes all the way up to seven o'clock or eight o'clock in the evening.

1098
02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:50.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you might create some statistics from that averaging or that information.

1099
02:41:53.130 --> 02:42:01.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, I'm open to any, any questions that you might have an email and we'll be back on this one. Wednesday.

1100
02:42:02.550 --> 02:42:13.020
MS Analytics Class 2021: So on Wednesday will have a session. And at that time I hope to hear people talking about what it is they want to do on this app on the schooling.

1101
02:42:13.770 --> 02:42:22.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: Once you figure out what it is you want to report, then it's just a matter of tweaking that the information on the GUI code that you that you are. Yeah.

1102
02:42:24.720 --> 02:42:27.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, that's it for today.

1103
02:42:28.470 --> 02:42:33.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: I'll stay online for a few minutes. If you have any questions or comments and

1104
02:42:33.870 --> 02:42:35.010
Amanda Pham: Have a question.

1105
02:42:35.760 --> 02:42:37.680
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, miss, Amanda.

1106
02:42:37.980 --> 02:42:39.330
Amanda Pham: Yes. Hi, Dr. Jones.

1107

02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:44.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: Here what

1109
02:42:51.960 --> 02:42:55.980
Amanda Pham: I'm Dr. Jones, I wanted to ask about the project. Whenever you're ready.

1110
02:42:57.180 --> 02:42:59.160
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, this is Amanda right

1111
02:42:59.190 --> 02:43:00.600
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yes. Okay.

1112
02:43:04.440 --> 02:43:05.100
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah.

1113
02:43:06.270 --> 02:43:07.800
Amanda Pham: Yes, about the group's

1114
02:43:08.280 --> 02:43:11.460
Amanda Pham: You mentioned two to three people is three, the max amount

1115
02:43:15.810 --> 02:43:19.080
Amanda Pham: Three people for the groups is that the x on people per group.

1116
02:43:20.160 --> 02:43:22.110
MS Analytics Class 2021: I can't hear it out.

1117
02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:25.560
MS Analytics Class 2021: And I don't have anybody here. Presley.

1118
02:43:28.320 --> 02:43:29.340
Amanda Pham: I'll email you

1119
02:43:31.980 --> 02:43:34.830
MS Analytics Class 2021: Send me send me a little email or

1120
02:43:36.720 --> 02:43:38.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: Something like that. I'll get back with you.

1121
02:43:39.540 --> 02:43:40.500
Amanda Pham: Okay. Sounds good.

1122
02:43:45.990 --> 02:43:47.670
Karis Jochen: Dr. Jones, can you hear me.

1123
02:43:49.770 --> 02:43:53.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: Oh, I see. Play as a question, he says, I'm looking at the chat.

1124
02:43:53.430 --> 02:43:57.450
MS Analytics Class 2021: Be played says, see the maximum number of people that project.

1125
02:43:58.080 --> 02:44:00.570
MS Analytics Class 2021: I would I would keep it three. Yeah.

1126
02:44:01.770 --> 02:44:04.500
MS Analytics Class 2021: Because I want to see everybody engaged and involved.

1127
02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:13.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: And I don't want, I don't think the project should be so big that it will require more than three people.

1128
02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:17.340
MS Analytics Class 2021: By the weekly assignments individual

1129
02:44:20.790 --> 02:44:25.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: To try and make it so. But if you need help on an assignment, feel free to talk to your neighbors.

1130
02:44:29.130 --> 02:44:34.110
MS Analytics Class 2021: The ID. The idea. This course is not really

1131
02:44:35.490 --> 02:44:42.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: So much about the grade, right. This is your last class you're graduating, you probably already, you already have a ring.

1132
02:44:42.630 --> 02:44:55.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: The purpose of this class is to learn something. So if you're working on homework assignment and you're stuck on something and you know somebody that can help you reach out and you can talk to me if you like. Okay.

1133
02:45:08.970 --> 02:45:12.270
Brian Frankel: Professor, this is Brian. So two quick questions. Can you hear me okay

1134
02:45:20.430 --> 02:45:22.290
MS Analytics Class 2021: Brian was what you're trying to say.

1135
02:45:23.250 --> 02:45:26.880
Brian Frankel: Just two quick questions. One, will you have office hours tomorrow.

1136
02:45:29.010 --> 02:45:30.270
MS Analytics Class 2021: What is what

1137
02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:34.230
Brian Frankel: Will you be holding office hours.

1138
02:45:34.230 --> 02:45:35.370
MS Analytics Class 2021: Tomorrow holy

1139
02:45:36.570 --> 02:45:37.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yeah, we'll see.

1140
02:45:39.390 --> 02:45:42.120
MS Analytics Class 2021: We'll see what did I say six or 730

1141
02:45:43.890 --> 02:45:52.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: That's going to be. It's on the syllabus every Wednesday at six instead of 30 we're going to have online online office hours.

1142
02:45:53.820 --> 02:45:55.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it's going to be recorded.

1143
02:45:57.240 --> 02:46:07.860
MS Analytics Class 2021: Normally what happens later in the office hours. It's all the questions and then after that, we'll get into the discussion, the homework.
