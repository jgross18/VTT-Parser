30
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.590
Faculty Office Hours: it's just making sure you understood the steps of how to do that and kind of basically taking the code, I gave you and making it your own with your own data set.

31
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.140

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:55.950
Faculty Office Hours: yeah yeah I gotta go back to that not to this one go back to a homework i'm Sorry, I just want to make sure it's right I.

160

Karen Fireman: apologize for any way we can get this not to sprint back like this.

161
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.520
Faculty Office Hours: I think it's just a.

162
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.270

165
00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:12.270
Faculty Office Hours: And it might be a setting.

166
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.210

Faculty Office Hours: We actually changed the bottom part and then change the date later from last year added a couple stuff to change the date, but the date was right within the bottom stuff wasn't there, so I don't know what happened but it's fixed now.

172
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:05.280

Faculty Office Hours: You don't mind.

174
00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.010

176
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.160
Faculty Office Hours: that's all you should see yeah.

177
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:14.610

Faculty Office Hours: Over the holidays and he sets all these assignments up and puts the dates and all that and then he set up his group, and then on Tuesday is like hey i'm I change them to individual like you said, and then.

180
00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:43.680
Faculty Office Hours: I don't know if somehow the date got messed up on three and then the two it got moved that the one got removed making available, so we should all be good they're.

184
00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:57.000
Karen Fireman: yeah I really thanks.

185
00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:06.210
Faculty Office Hours: Thanks for clarifying that I truly am not trying to confuse you are basically the animal file, so that I can just take your email file and try to create the environment, you set up.

186
00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:19.230
Faculty Office Hours: And don't you don't get like super crazy and put 42 packages out there, you know just put a couple right I don't know exactly what sort of the if I told you to put any I can't remember let's see when I say what did I say I said.

187
00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:27.510
Faculty Office Hours: create an environment install the seaborne package and one other package so that way I don't not when i'm looking at your dmo file and testing it out.

188
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:39.060
Faculty Office Hours: yeah it's not trying to stall 40 packages just trying to stall those two and the dependencies and then like said, all I really need, then, if the animal file and then you're your Python and data.

189
00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.960
Faculty Office Hours: That way, I can take your Python file your data file and run your code.

190
00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:50.310
What else.

191
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:53.340

196
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.480
Faculty Office Hours: Oh yeah.

197
00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:14.340
shadi kilani: I didn't know that about you i'm also I do I do a lot of brisket maybe we can talk about that later.

198
00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:15.330
Faculty Office Hours: Oh yeah.

199
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:22.770

200
00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.680
Faculty Office Hours: that's gonna put put an image of one of the last person, I mean the chat for it.

201
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:34.620
Faculty Office Hours: Next.

202
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.960
Faculty Office Hours: Year we'll get through all the issues you have.

203
00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:42.510
Christian Gover: I have a question.

204
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.550
Christian Gover: sure this is Christian.

205
00:16:45.060 --> 00:17:00.420
Christian Gover: Christian so i'm trying to find the picked a data set and it has dates right and then run it through X well, well, I tried to import it to non pie i'm not able to read.

206
00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.090
Faculty Office Hours: here's what i'll suggest for now.

207
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.810
Faculty Office Hours: Just finally dataset without dates.

208
00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:07.710
Christian Gover: well.

209
00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.890
Christian Gover: I just didn't include the dance is that OK, I just.

210
00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:23.760
Faculty Office Hours: yeah it's fine, I guess, this is not about building a model, this is about getting the data splitting your y axis, and you know, training, a model I don't care if it's good or not that's Dr jones's class that's not this class.

211
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.020
Faculty Office Hours: saving up the.

212
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:36.150
Faculty Office Hours: pickle file, you know reading them back typical file doing a prediction against it so like said, really, the main things to think about is this your brain renewed read your data set and you're going to split the x's and y's.

213
00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:42.600
Faculty Office Hours: Even a train that model against it and then at the bottom you're going to save it out to that binary file.

214
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:52.680
Faculty Office Hours: Your model your read that binary file back in and then you're going to run some predictions against them, so one one thing to remember is to make sure that that.

215
00:17:53.220 --> 00:18:06.960
Faculty Office Hours: prediction part where you bring in your new X right list to protect against you want to make sure it's got the same number of variables, as your ex that in your training and testing data sets when you build your models that make sense.

216
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.280
Christian Gover: yeah that makes sense I just copied or record from my.

217
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.860
Faculty Office Hours: CSS exactly I said you don't have to.

218
00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.870
Faculty Office Hours: i'm not looking to see if you.

219
00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:20.220
Faculty Office Hours: created a new record from the old you know just copy align from the.

220
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:32.550
Faculty Office Hours: From the from the data set and for the axis and then practice correct against it it's, just like the hope you know the whole point of this exercise is to give you a.

221
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:45.300
Faculty Office Hours: Some code and to make it your own to your data set, and you know, save the predictions down we're going to build on this and then we're gonna I severance package, it up in a flash right rest service thrown into a docker container.

222
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.110
Faculty Office Hours: You know, show you how to deploy into Cooper daddy's until a cluster.

223
00:18:50.940 --> 00:19:05.790
Faculty Office Hours: Based I will basically show you how we scale this thing up at scale on how companies like Amazon and walmart use technology like Cooper daddy's to build these these services, the scale of millions and billions of users, literally.

224
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:24.060
Karen Fireman: Jamie it's Karen i'm i'm sure you're telling us this because my reading of these three little cryptic sentence it's at the bottom I don't think I would have realized that we're supposed to run the models on it, but now I understand we run it and and.

225
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.440
Faculty Office Hours: yeah just yeah.

226
00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:30.840
Faculty Office Hours: Little happiness you wanted yeah basically The thing is, is just to take those two.

227
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:37.140
Faculty Office Hours: You know just take the to actually do is just grabbed mine put your own data sets and they're basically.

228
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:38.220
Karen Fireman: That product guy.

229
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.730
Karen Fireman: But far down we go I guess from the whole file.

230
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.080
Faculty Office Hours: yeah run all the way through the.

231
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.220
Faculty Office Hours: Evidence say about that file load it back in and then do a prediction against it.

232
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.850
Faculty Office Hours: That makes sense.

233
00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:52.620
Karen Fireman: Where are we doing a prediction.

234
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:58.680
Faculty Office Hours: At the bottom, if you look at the bottom there's a predict function, so let me see, let me pull it up.

235
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:00.690
Faculty Office Hours: Let me.

236
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.400
Faculty Office Hours: Let me get to my remote desktop i'll show you.

237
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.890
Karen Fireman: So in like the pickle final or.

238
00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:11.520
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so go ahead yeah if you if you look at the pickle file.

239
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:13.590
Faculty Office Hours: Let me get.

240
00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:21.300
Faculty Office Hours: So if you take like just look at the picture one, for example, that's the easiest one right that's the first one, I showed you if you go all the way at the bottom.

241
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:30.930
Faculty Office Hours: The last like 1015 lines of code you're going to see where you save that out to a pickle file, then you see where you load that file you saved it out to your load it right back.

242
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:44.880
Faculty Office Hours: You know, in the real world, you know you build your model you save your pickle file and that file be packaged up into some kind of package to be used in service to send data and to protect against you know i'm putting all the one script just so you can see it.

243
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.830
Karen Fireman: Right, so we dumped it into the pickle.

244
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:47.790
Faculty Office Hours: Then there's any low.

245
00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:48.750
Karen Fireman: about that.

246
00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:56.460
Faculty Office Hours: So then, you see where we load that pickle file backup right right, and then you see where we set a list for X like new X variables to predict.

247
00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.150
Karen Fireman: How well loaded model rf yeah.

248
00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.500
Faculty Office Hours: And then below that.

249
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.940
Karen Fireman: I have like a lead that's nothing.

250
00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.470
Faculty Office Hours: Let me leave them a follow on one second.

251
00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.250
Faculty Office Hours: Let me get.

252
00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.620
Karen Fireman: These files do I have to upload a new version.

253
00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:15.240
Faculty Office Hours: I haven't changed these files at all.

254
00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:16.920
Faculty Office Hours: Let me.

255
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.130
Faculty Office Hours: Let me save.

256
00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:24.540
Karen Fireman: In the wrong spot.

257
00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.620
Faculty Office Hours: One second i'm just open the files up, so I can get there.

258
00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.230
Karen Fireman: i'm not here, if you want me to show you.

259
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.310
Faculty Office Hours: Oh yeah that's fine that's fine, you will share your screen shot i'll make it easier for me.

260
00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.500
Karen Fireman: Can you can you see my screen here.

261
00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:02.370
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I can alright so right there.

262
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.640
Faculty Office Hours: So go down the bottom of this project.

263
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.800
Karen Fireman: we've dumped it we loaded it.

264
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.240
Faculty Office Hours: makes you to predict.

265
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.340
Karen Fireman: It is lists of string here so.

266
00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:18.840
Faculty Office Hours: that's that list of string so, whatever your so that list of strings so that's just one record that you can just pull one record out of your X.

267
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:29.400
Faculty Office Hours: And dump in there because, basically, what you're doing there in line and line 78 you're saying take my model I built, which is that model rf that random forest model.

268
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:31.050
Faculty Office Hours: dump into that file.

269
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.220
Faculty Office Hours: Right, then in the road and then we're saying hey let's load this money back in.

270
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:40.320
Faculty Office Hours: Right file and then what's predict against it, and this case we're just saying we're sending a list so.

271
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.980
Karen Fireman: This is going to shoot something out I forgot yeah.

272
00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:50.400
Karen Fireman: i'm sorry I forgot that that's with Dr big does okay that's what that's okay i'm sorry.

273
00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:54.390
Faculty Office Hours: No you're fine that's it, so we have these office hours for okay.

274

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:41.010
Faculty Office Hours: All right, who is not working, I know a couple people have emailed me you one of them being Monica you're having an issue with vs code and I think one other person was having.

281
00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:41.880
me.

282
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.590
Monica A. Harwig: um I got mine actually I started working.

283
00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:47.730
Faculty Office Hours: And I did it.

284
00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:51.300
Monica A. Harwig: yeah everything I figured it out and it's working fine so.

285
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:52.380
Faculty Office Hours: awesome like.

286
00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:57.330
Karen Fireman: Out of curiosity, what was the problem I may run into that problem.

287
00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:58.890
Monica A. Harwig: It was probably.

288
00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:12.750
Monica A. Harwig: It was hard to on the extra boost file to run the couldn't open up the data set right it wasn't exporting it wasn't importing it from the file.

289
00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:24.000
Monica A. Harwig: And then I in so I finally figured out I just had a mess with and I finally got it to work and then the night, and then, when he when he showed the variables.

290
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:29.370
Monica A. Harwig: There was a button you push I couldn't find it and then I finally I found it so after that I always.

291
00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:46.350
Faculty Office Hours: Always when you're in the interactive window the variables are the one that looks like this spreadsheet icon and then the restart if you want to restart your terminal that's the one that looks like a recycle little green spinning recycle recycle but, like a rewind kind of thing.

292
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:48.720
Faculty Office Hours: cool yeah.

293
00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:58.830
Monica A. Harwig: So yeah so it was locking up earlier and I just turned off everything and turn it back on, and then I started I used to different visual studio I was using the one in anaconda and then I just use one down.

294

296
00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:11.520
Faculty Office Hours: Like the other day we had the issue with the anaconda navigator starting your visual studio code, I think we have to start it from the start menu.

297
00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.260
Karen Fireman: Thank you yeah thanks for the tips.

298
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:20.280
Jim Clark: Oh, can you take a take my visual studio code question.

299
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.080
Jim Clark: Absolutely okay.

300
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:26.700
Faculty Office Hours: I kind of want to make sure if people aren't getting visual studio working.

301
00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:32.040
Faculty Office Hours: code working, I want to make sure we get that done first because I don't want you to be waiting around now here's the thing.

302
00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:47.100
Faculty Office Hours: You don't have to use visual studio code, if you like, spider, if you like, notebooks whatever you know you can use whatever whatever environment you're comfortable with i'm i'm just showing you code, because more and more people I know are using it and it's it's just a really great product.

303
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:56.970
Jim Clark: Right and thank you, I mean I can I can run these programs in spider and that's that's great I think visual studio has got more flexibility and more powerful so.

304
00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.770
Faculty Office Hours: let's show me your dream will get you fixed up all right bye.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:30:02.370
Jim Clark: It I I haven't tried it intellectually, I think, but I went through actually went through here this one, you probably can't see it.

352
00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:06.690
Faculty Office Hours: Oh, you know what I think I figured this out after I fixed machines I fixed your machine on Tuesday night.

353
00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:07.770
Faculty Office Hours: And then I think.

354
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.570
Faculty Office Hours: I figured this all out on Wednesday.

355
00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:13.920
Jim Clark: But yeah I was thinking that maybe I didn't do all the content installs I.

356
00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:14.580
Faculty Office Hours: know.

357
00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:16.650
Faculty Office Hours: I did I should.

359
00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:23.310
Jim Clark: here's some other so T so.

360
00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:35.520
Faculty Office Hours: Now that was the only thing I think I figured out after I fixed number of the 32 bit issue where you had some packet some 32 bit packages and try to go delete a bunch of stuff and then.

361
00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:45.930
Faculty Office Hours: I got it fixed we got it fixed somebody to run them, are you are having issues were some packages or installing some work and had to do with pat and just using 32 bit windows and functions.

362
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.320
Faculty Office Hours: As.

363
00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:49.110
Faculty Office Hours: I haven't run through all of them to make sure they all right.

364
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.120
Jim Clark: yeah Frankenstein Frankenstein.

365
00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:53.370
Karen Fireman: Yes, you.

366
00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:55.170
Faculty Office Hours: Miss me i'm sorry.

367
00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:59.400
Karen Fireman: that's Okay, and then pickle file online i'm 32.

368
00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:02.400
Faculty Office Hours: guys do me a favor is that you're either jail.

369
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.240
Karen Fireman: feel I feel.

370
00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:04.140
Karen Fireman: happy to show you.

371
00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:06.270
Faculty Office Hours: Oh, James are you there, so I was gonna let him.

372
00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.090
Faculty Office Hours: And you see his screen.

373
00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:14.700
Karen Fireman: yeah yeah so I just wanted you to explain what's going on here.

374
00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:18.360
Karen Fireman: Oh sure yeah where do we see what does that mean, and where did we set that up.

375
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:34.080
Faculty Office Hours: So the path that joined that's just a function that comes from import os the APP route is a variable that APP route is set in the settings dot php file so Jim do me a favor click the two little notebook of icons the top left again.

376
00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:43.740
Faculty Office Hours: click there and then, if he goes down, where the tour it's highlighted blue right now right where the pickle far right below that you see settings dot P, why.

377
00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:45.750
Faculty Office Hours: it's like that, for me.

378
00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:55.290
Faculty Office Hours: So that's their see that APP route equals osteopath surname that right, that what that is is the APP static, you can ignore that what that is is.

379
00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:03.990
Faculty Office Hours: That one saying hey create me a variable called APP static that's equal to the current path that this Python file is in which is that APP route.

380
00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:12.420
Faculty Office Hours: static and that's just that's just in there, in case you ever wanted to know how to to create variables two different folders with inside your folder.

381
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:28.620
Faculty Office Hours: So that's what that APP static is but the APP route is the one we're using and what that does is it uses that ospf surname to get the path of where your file is so that underscore underscore file underscore underscore that's just like a an embedded variable in Python that says.

382
00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:32.250
Karen Fireman: hey I don't actually like to see that okay yeah it's an embedded okay.

383
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:42.030
Faculty Office Hours: So that's that's just an embedded variable that says, give me my my path and file and then this i'm just using some functions from the os package and Porto asked.

384
00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:54.150
Faculty Office Hours: To get that directory where that files located so if we go back to the pickle file So you see, I sent that variable APP route, so if you go back Jim if you just click down the pickle you can just click right there yeah.

385
00:32:55.110 --> 00:33:00.270
Faculty Office Hours: So if you go to the top see right off the top I just mean favorite Jim tops right there, it says from settings.

386
00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.190
Faculty Office Hours: yeah just scroll down just.

387
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:16.500
Faculty Office Hours: See from settings I same from the settings dot P, why you don't have to put poi so it knows from settings and says okay my look for a package called settings or look for a file called settings dot p.

388
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:33.180
Faculty Office Hours: P lie in the same folder i'm in and then import APP rw APP or is that variable we sent in that setting, so what this does and it allows us to when we call our our file to read in our data set or when we're writing our file out so if you scroll down a little just a.

389
00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.470
little bit too soon.

390
00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:43.620
Faculty Office Hours: let's stop right here first see notice, you have 32 scar you're right right there see where we're we're loading the data set and we're saying.

391
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:56.520
Faculty Office Hours: os path join APP route and then the name of the file, so what that's going to be is like C colon slash so APP route is going to be a folder where this Python file is, and if you notice in the same direct directory I have.

392
00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:06.810
Faculty Office Hours: The data file the csv file so that becomes the folder whatever folder you're your Python file data file is that folder slash wine quality read csv that makes sense.

393
00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:11.190
Karen Fireman: yeah yeah.

394
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:17.520
Karen Fireman: And then the other version and they're not the APP the other variable would you say that one.

395
00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.070
Faculty Office Hours: So that again.

396
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:21.180
Karen Fireman: Well, in the settings.

397
00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:29.130
Faculty Office Hours: You can ignore that what the APP static is is, if you notice it's like if you go back to settings dot P, why Jim if you don't mind.

398
00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:41.070
Faculty Office Hours: Do you look that i've static is os path join APP route and then started um that's that's just a leftover from me.

399
00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:51.120
Faculty Office Hours: code, so that static would be like, if I have a folder in here called static I could use this APP static vic variable to represent static, so I could take.

400
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:55.500
Faculty Office Hours: What am I doing next semester, and I wanted to do like an extra folder in there now.

401
00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:56.880
Karen Fireman: Again, the root folder.

402
00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:03.330
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so yeah you can put another folder I think what we're doing next year is i'm going to create APP data.

403
00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:12.090
Faculty Office Hours: and create a folder called data and put all the data file into data and then you know now that you're asking these questions, because then it will make sense, because then.

404
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:21.660
Faculty Office Hours: That variable will become used and you'll see it you'll see it through you'll see APP data and your code and then it's like so what i'll do I think next year is i'll create.

405
00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:27.690
Faculty Office Hours: You know I create the code i'll create a folder called data and probably data files in it and i'll set of ap static i'll have APP.

406
00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:41.760
Faculty Office Hours: Data now, I believe we have static we're going to use we're going to use some of these underlying folders that the settings file around us more than just APP route and a couple weeks, but that's that makes sense, with that is.

407
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:50.430
Karen Fireman: Just double checking I got this so so if we were to have this other set of that you're going to foist on next year, so so yeah apologies when you do it.

408
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:51.960
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

409
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:57.570
Karen Fireman: So our data would be in a sub folder name static, in this case.

410
00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.950
Faculty Office Hours: In this case, data correct.

411
00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:08.010
Karen Fireman: Instead of calling a data you'd be calling it static, in this case, and then there are file rp we filed IP Why is in the APP route director, you have.

412
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:15.600
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so like in the pickle file, where I say read the data, instead of using APP route I would use to APP static right.

413
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:17.460
Karen Fireman: that's not as clear.

414
00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:18.750
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so so right.

415
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:24.360
Faculty Office Hours: There see right there line 32 right now my csv file is in the room, right now, right.

416
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.310
Karen Fireman: I don't know because it would have been somewhere else.

417
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.680
Karen Fireman: story here to.

418
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:31.260
Karen Fireman: The people storing it.

419
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.270
Faculty Office Hours: i'm just using opportunity.

420
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:35.460
Faculty Office Hours: i'm just using that group.

421
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.160
Karen Fireman: I guess for now it's easier for me with the accurate okay.

422
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:43.080
Faculty Office Hours: So I think what I might do just because you appreciate the feedback.

423
00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:53.010
Faculty Office Hours: You know, but I think what I might do going forward for these type of things is create an APP route and like out data and then like APP you know models, or something.

424
00:36:53.490 --> 00:37:04.110
Faculty Office Hours: And then put out, you know, save on our models and they're like APP models, but all the data into a data and put all the you know at the root have all the Python files, maybe something like that so then people can you know see.

425
00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:14.670
Faculty Office Hours: How how you can have multiple data folders just you know because it's just the reality is probably a better practice to do that right to create like a data folder to create like a model folder.

426
00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:20.490
Karen Fireman: And then use either yeah when you do it, how about giving us a little warning because I think it'll mean that none of our stuff will work.

427
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:29.760
Faculty Office Hours: easily and total i'm not changing anything right now right you're all good don't worry i'm just i'm doing things i'm just thinking out loud right now, so that.

428
00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:37.410
Faculty Office Hours: You know, when I do this next year, you know I might have had more code and do more things i'm always trying to build right.

429
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:49.650
Faculty Office Hours: And so I think it's I think it'd be a good idea to do it that way, because a then people can look at it and see where there's APP routing the full file and see APP data see at model and then see the things and see what's going on, so.

430
00:37:50.250 --> 00:38:04.650
Faculty Office Hours: So thanks for the feedback, though, because that that that kind of helps it helps me make the class better so and then hopefully this does this make sense, though, the main thing is what I now want to make sure if it made sense what I was do for you what those mean those variables.

431
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:13.170
Jim Clark: which was also really getting used to is is take him and mastering over anything that might give me some information.

432
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:13.770
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

433
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:19.050
Jim Clark: And so that's something that really helped me the color coloring and starting to make sense to me now.

434
00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:19.290
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

435
00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:35.460
Jim Clark: But the fact that I can do this and it says oh here's the path for that well that's that's a director i'm working in and that those csv files are there, so I go Okay, so this is a way of checking past names that are weird like that so yeah i'm fighting.

436
00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:38.820
Faculty Office Hours: that's from that pie lance that's that pile and.

437
00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:39.930
Faculty Office Hours: Extension I had you all in.

438
00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:42.420
Faculty Office Hours: All last week on Thursday.

439
00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.390
Faculty Office Hours: I knew extend extension Microsoft put out in the last.

440
00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:46.080
Faculty Office Hours: couple months.

441
00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:54.330
Faculty Office Hours: that's why I really like vs code Microsoft is building a lot more stuff into the into the Python coding and vs code.

442
00:38:54.780 --> 00:39:03.540
Jim Clark: So i'm i'm all i'm okay with learning multiple systems i'm going to make sure that out, so I just thought it was not working, it actually was so.

443
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:04.800
Faculty Office Hours: yeah no worries.

444
00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:05.370
cool.

445
00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:10.680
Karen Fireman: Another quick question when you little.

446
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:27.180
Karen Fireman: Little spreadsheet look at the variables and I Double Click on one of these data frame variables I get you know your your whole thing on the left, but when I Double Click on just an integer variable I get nothing like i'm if I Double Click on on the one that said.

447
00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:36.840
Karen Fireman: Like X or y it's fine, I get the Left, I get the stuff on the left side or data set or whatever, but if I click on the seed, which is just a single number again.

448
00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:44.610
Faculty Office Hours: You won't be like, if you look on the yeah right there is the variable seat and the value is a literal and the value of seven.

449
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:46.110
Faculty Office Hours: Because that's not.

450
00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:48.000
Karen Fireman: The right side it doesn't need to show me.

451
00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:52.020
Faculty Office Hours: On the interactive and you click the little spreadsheet thing.

452
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:53.700
Karen Fireman: yeah exactly.

453
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:54.210
Faculty Office Hours: Like you.

454
00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:57.300
Karen Fireman: click on the show because it's 30 sitting there okay I gotcha.

455
00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:05.940
Faculty Office Hours: yeah Well, no, but if you click on the spreadsheet you should still see see there won't be a little there won't be a little icon So if you go and click the link right.

456
00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:07.380
Karen Fireman: Here you.

457
00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:08.370
Karen Fireman: know I gotta.

458
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:13.500
Faculty Office Hours: realize Jim is Jim screen So if you go right there.

459
00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:16.500
Jim Clark: That actually helps me, because this is this is this is.

460
00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:18.450
Jim Clark: Reinforcing some things that I did.

461
00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:20.880
Faculty Office Hours: So if you scroll down Jim you know.

462
00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:21.990
Faculty Office Hours: If you look for seed.

463
00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:28.710
Faculty Office Hours: He looked for seed So you see the things that has to stop right there have an icon to the left, why right.

464
00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.000
Karen Fireman: Because it's a single.

465
00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:31.230
Faculty Office Hours: Variable at the end.

466
00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:46.110
Faculty Office Hours: Right, but the reason why prediction, and all those those are list, and so the interactive studio the Python interactive window smart enough to know things that are list or non Pio raise you know non pie in the arrays or.

467
00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:54.870
Faculty Office Hours: Panda data frames and those those have multiple rows and columns or at least multiple columns or milk right, and so it says hey I want to show you that data view.

468
00:40:55.140 --> 00:41:03.090
Faculty Office Hours: With things that's just a value like text size point three seed seven it's just going to say here's the name here's the type and here's the value.

469
00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:07.230
Faculty Office Hours: You see what it says, the value of seven yeah yeah.

470
00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:15.540
Faculty Office Hours: gotcha and then, if you click the little the little spreadsheet icon again Jim that'll go away for you, so you can see your real estate and.

471
00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.600
Faculty Office Hours: Like I said, like if you had a bunch of like the rain your interactive.

472
00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:23.070
Faculty Office Hours: window you got a bunch of errors and you're like man i'm gonna go fix them rerun it again and get read everything.

473
00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:34.290
Faculty Office Hours: And I want you to write on my variable So if you click the little green like little that thing there and then, if you go to the left and click the little X right there everything cleared I haven't put the little spreadsheet thing again Jim.

474
00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:36.810
Faculty Office Hours: everything's gone.

475
00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:39.690
Faculty Office Hours: We restarted or Colonel.

476
00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:41.430
Karen Fireman: here.

477
00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:48.870
Karen Fireman: got your terminal at the bottom of CA is gone from jim's sheet again tonight.

478
00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:57.270
Karen Fireman: And then suddenly you had those four things at the bottom problems output debug counts console and terminal but they're going again.

479
00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:58.080
Faculty Office Hours: right there.

480
00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:59.040
Karen Fireman: Air oh.

481
00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:06.360
Faculty Office Hours: it's just I just had a move it so it's really a lot smaller so that we can get some real estate Oh, he has a way up there.

482
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:10.200
Karen Fireman: Oh, it is weight down how did you get back to it when it was disappearing.

483
00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:16.890
Jim Clark: On my screen it's there, I can see it but, but the green box just contain it to.

484
00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:17.940
Jim Clark: A kid might be.

485
00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:23.190
Jim Clark: It might i've got a really wide screen, it may be cutting over at all.

486
00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:33.810
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so Jim has to share just Jim has this like 7000 and score live screen so Jim just shares his programs, not the screen because.

487
00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:40.800
Faculty Office Hours: He shares his programs look like little you know look like little icons on the screen and you can't see them.

488
00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:41.790
yeah.

489
00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:48.180
Jim Clark: splurge and bought a 49 inch wide screen so wonderful, for me, but.

490
00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.670
Jim Clark: yeah hell is hell, when I shut the whole screen.

491
00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.020
Faculty Office Hours: yeah that's why.

492
00:42:52.920 --> 00:43:02.040
Faculty Office Hours: that's why I have multiple so I have a 34 inch curved screen, but I have two inputs into it so it's split, and so the left side is.

493
00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:11.700
Faculty Office Hours: The Left sides like 1900 by 12 at you know horizontal and then the right sides, the flip of that it's like.

494
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:19.830
Faculty Office Hours: I want to say it's like 2800 by a half an hour afterwards, but it's actually a portrait mode.

495
00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:25.560
Faculty Office Hours: And so it's real Nice because I can put the code and stuff and the left side, and then I can put.

496
00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:36.330
Faculty Office Hours: Inner explorer I mean the edge not exploring where we're like as your chrome on the right and look up documentation and code on the left, so I can take my one big monitor and split it into two because it has two inputs.

497
00:43:37.590 --> 00:43:46.800
Jim Clark: Right, and so what i'm using mind for is I can put it through different screens that are relatively large I mean i've i've never had so little ice cream.

498
00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:48.120
Faculty Office Hours: When i'm looking at this.

499
00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:48.540
yeah.

500
00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:53.370
Jim Clark: I society issue, I went I bought a.

501
00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.330
Jim Clark: macbook pro and I met, I met grow.

502
00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:03.600
Jim Clark: So it'll be about the 15th so it'll hit the magic the magic keyboard and all that so.

503
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:10.680
Faculty Office Hours: I always want the iPad pro one like just like mine i'll show you i'll show you how to set up a vm if you have any windows.

504
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:15.120
Jim Clark: Know i'd love to be able to remote into my laptop.

505
00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:16.110
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

506
00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:19.290
Jim Clark: Because that's that's the only machine I have now that running all the time.

507
00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:21.390
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I can I can show you how to make that work.

508
00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:22.650
Jim Clark: That way.

509
00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:30.030
Faculty Office Hours: The other option is if you're willing to pay like 20 bucks a month 1520 bucks a month, you can just set up an azure vm.

510
00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:39.690
Faculty Office Hours: That you get you know, depending on how often you need it like like I do for Class right when I go to class I split up my azure vm in the cloud, which is just a windows 10 pro box.

511
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:48.030
Faculty Office Hours: With you know certain amount of Ram and all that and then that's what I use for Class because I know exactly what's on there, because I can set it up before class.

512
00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:58.380
Faculty Office Hours: And then show up and then i've done all the work the night before they before and i've got everything ready on it and it's just I just I can start it up from my phone.

513
00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:06.840
Faculty Office Hours: On the portal as report as your APP can start it up for my phone and then I just opened up remote desktop and remote into it yeah.

514
00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:09.030
Jim Clark: i'm lifting know how to do that well.

515
00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.400

Faculty Office Hours: So that that if you just want to get the file and and put that in your already week one folder you can do that so and then there's notes in there, so we can just open up that Python file, I can show you.

537
00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:47.940
Karen Fireman: Okay.

538
00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:51.300

Faculty Office Hours: A lower open.

565
00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:43.260
Karen Fireman: visual studio i'll have it, I just opened it and.

566
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.840
Faculty Office Hours: I said, if you go to your visual studio you're probably are no.

567
00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:47.550
Karen Fireman: I think I did the wrong thing when.

568
00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:49.710
Faculty Office Hours: you're fine I should go to your visual studio can.

569
00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:51.480
Karen Fireman: yeah sorry.

570
00:48:52.200 --> 00:49:01.860
Faculty Office Hours: He dropped in that folder I think you're already your visual studio code is already open to that folder So if you go in there you'll see if you click your the top left there.

571
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:04.740
Faculty Office Hours: yeah right there click that.

572
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:08.790

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:09.450
That.

574
00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:13.470
Faculty Office Hours: that's the one you just download it and so.

575
00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:14.790
Karen Fireman: I find it.

576
00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:17.100
Faculty Office Hours: Just to the right to open it up.

577
00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:20.310
Faculty Office Hours: it's got your screen split right now, so if you.

578
00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:22.890
Karen Fireman: can close this part right get real estate right.

579
00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:24.030
Faculty Office Hours: And then yeah.

580
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:26.460
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so see it's open over to the right there.

581
00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:27.750
Karen Fireman: Why did you do that.

582
00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:34.050
Faculty Office Hours: yeah it's just so he can do is you can close out some of these windows and then, and then we can.

583
00:49:34.830 --> 00:49:41.340
Karen Fireman: Then we can real trouble with this, I sort of all the the yeah it's getting a little bit confusing.

584
00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:42.480
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

585
00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:46.320
Faculty Office Hours: I it's just just got a lot oh had to get to it sometimes I just have to.

587
00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:50.250
Faculty Office Hours: All so you'd like close all right there if you wanted to.

588
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.290
Karen Fireman: I didn't really want to, but okay.

589
00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:56.550
Faculty Office Hours: I was just showing you the option, I was necessarily saying.

590
00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:59.310
Karen Fireman: No now this thing is, I think how I got this stuff.

591
00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:01.470
Faculty Office Hours: yeah yeah you don't want to run that well now.

592
00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:02.280
Karen Fireman: What is.

593
00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:09.240
Faculty Office Hours: That that runs into the internal don't use that always use the shift in or highlight and right click and run in the.

594
00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:11.250
Karen Fireman: Okay, all right So yes.

595
00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:12.780
Karen Fireman: So now he's or leave that.

596
00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:18.090
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so that's so now you're at the right one, so now, if you scroll down a little, and so, if we stop right here.

597
00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:32.010
Faculty Office Hours: I put some notes, right here, so, if you look I kind of put some some cells, so we kind of have to run this so that we can see, so if you go up to the top so just to kind of show you the cells, I put those little they don't highlight.

598
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:32.760
Karen Fireman: Remember.

599
00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:34.140
Karen Fireman: Oh, we don't have to highlight.

600
00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:36.510
Faculty Office Hours: The highlight scroll scroll to the top a little.

601
00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:39.240
Faculty Office Hours: So I went ahead and remember those little.

602
00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.580
Karen Fireman: Remember the cell C empathy sense yeah.

603
00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:44.910
Faculty Office Hours: So click run support that first one cell right there right below on 13.

604
00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:45.990
Karen Fireman: Okay.

605
00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:53.460
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so that worked so now, you can go click the one now there's already moved you down go back up to the next.

606
00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:54.780
Karen Fireman: move me into the next one.

607
00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:56.370
Faculty Office Hours: So great hands on 29.

608
00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:01.860
Faculty Office Hours: OK, so now, so what it did, is that loaded the data.

609
00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:08.070
Faculty Office Hours: Right and so now, if you go and run the next one that's online 57 there at the bottom see move down.

610
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:17.640
Faculty Office Hours: So now see right there what I showed you right there I did this, I did a couple cells oh so now, I said Look how many classes have one client or data well there's 345678.

611
00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:28.500
Faculty Office Hours: Right, so, if you look at our data we look at our why column it's you know the qualities from like one to 10 but our our our actual data just has 345678.

612
00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:36.960
Faculty Office Hours: So that's what and because it's a number I just did a unique and returned it as array just so you can see Okay, we have classes three through eight.

613
00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:38.190
Karen Fireman: OK.

614
00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:43.320
Faculty Office Hours: So now, if I go let's run the next sale right there line 61.

615
00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.200
Faculty Office Hours: So this is.

616
00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:54.480
Faculty Office Hours: What it would look like before look at, so what so it's yeah so so the.

617
00:51:55.170 --> 00:52:07.890
Faculty Office Hours: Online 62 is what we did is we just ran line 63 so in line 62 it says what does our why Paul is look like before one hot encoding and i'm just selecting the top three rows so the top three is have classes of 555 right.

618
00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:09.960
Karen Fireman: So that's her wide it's 555.

619
00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:14.610
Faculty Office Hours: You can also see that in your values, you know, so you see i'm saying so that's your.

620
00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:18.240
Karen Fireman: that's those those well you want a little fast for me to think about what you're saying.

621
00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:19.440
Faculty Office Hours: yeah sure sure sure.

622
00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:26.190
Karen Fireman: So you're saying look at the first three rows and columns and there's only one column so it's five.

623
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:28.890
Karen Fireman: A category.

624
00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:31.590
Karen Fireman: And what we're we're figuring out about that.

625
00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:41.070
Faculty Office Hours: So that's just saying hey before we want hot and cold our data so right now we just have one why column, and it has a category in there for the one quality, you know one.

626
00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:44.520
Karen Fireman: You want to push those into different columns for each category.

627
00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:50.700
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so we want to create what's known as I can remember like we created indicator variables and jump you probably.

628
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.010
Karen Fireman: Remember, Dr Dr Harris class.

629
00:52:53.130 --> 00:53:08.850
Faculty Office Hours: yeah and you probably did the same thing in the summer and Python you know, a call 100 coding So if you run once and maybe Okay, maybe didn't, but if you run a line 65 day that runs sell right above line 65 put that so that to categorical.

630
00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:17.430
Faculty Office Hours: That went and said take those five and create those correct that one hot encoding those indicator type very.

631
00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.220
Karen Fireman: is doing this, what row is doing what you're saying.

632
00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:22.020
Faculty Office Hours: that's row 68.

633
00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:24.900
Karen Fireman: The print is doing it.

634
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:27.300
Faculty Office Hours: So let's do the to categorical is doing it.

635
00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:35.160
Stephanie Pollock: So I man i'm getting an error with that it says to name to categorical is not defined.

636
00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:52.410
Faculty Office Hours: Did it run So if you maybe you didn't run the packages of top so that to categorical comes from up there, see we're stop right there Karen just go down a little bit it's actually a little below that see right there, it says a from tensorflow charisse you chills important to categorical.

637
00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:54.450
Faculty Office Hours: And that's what that to categorical came.

638
00:53:54.450 --> 00:53:55.560
Karen Fireman: From here.

639
00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:59.790
Faculty Office Hours: So if you didn't run that you get that error message about to categorical.

640
00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:02.310
Karen Fireman: Okay, oh.

641
00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:05.700
Faculty Office Hours: what's, this is the only way that we do the including.

642
00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:10.410
Faculty Office Hours: yeah let's just keep walking through this carry your screen and then we'll go back if you're up Monica.

643
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:14.250
Stephanie Pollock: That said, that or something yeah it's stephanie.

644
00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:20.070
Faculty Office Hours: Okay stephanie yeah let's just keep one thing karen's and then afterwards if you're stopping the air will open your screen up and get your running.

645
00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:25.530
James Kramer: yeah I have some other I have similar issues it's unable to import the tensorflow so anyway.

646
00:54:26.250 --> 00:54:36.570
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, maybe it's not installed in your look at your bottom left and make sure the on the bottom far bottom left of your vs code, make sure you're using that bod 689 one.

647
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:38.580
Karen Fireman: which might say, but we know.

648
00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:40.980
James Kramer: What come back to it let's keep going.

649
00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:54.870
Faculty Office Hours: So, so that line 68 that's that to categorical that's a curious package that says hey take that one column and make those indicator variable So if you look you see now you have 0000001000.

650
00:54:56.850 --> 00:55:02.250
Faculty Office Hours: Right, and so what that is is even though, even though we only had classes three through eight.

651
00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:11.340
Faculty Office Hours: it's going to start at zero so you had 012345 you know it's the ones are in that that fives and then you have 678 right.

652
00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:18.660
Faculty Office Hours: smart enough to look at your data and say Okay, you have values from zero what's the Max eight Okay, some of these zero through eight.

653
00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:30.600
Faculty Office Hours: And these integers is it was looking for these looks for managers to do this, and so okay so since our first three rows you looked at her fives that's all we get those ones in that fifth position does that make sense.

654
00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:31.380
Karen Fireman: It does.

655
00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:41.220
Faculty Office Hours: So now, so we didn't actually make our we didn't actually make our one hot encoding just yet this is just to show us what to do, and if you go down and you're on that.

656
00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:46.290
Faculty Office Hours: So if you scroll down, while that's running Karen just scroll down a.

657
00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:49.140
Faculty Office Hours: Little here yeah we're there to.

658
00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:53.430
Faculty Office Hours: See right there that's where it's building the that's building the artificial neural net.

659
00:55:54.330 --> 00:56:08.010
Faculty Office Hours: Just use your wire and sequential 737 so that we're just doing a full technique already five splits and we're going to shuffle them around states or basically we're going to pull random number of rows.

660
00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:28.290
Faculty Office Hours: out build the model and run us through and do that you know five times as we train so right there if you look in lines 9091 that's actually where we're taking and say and use that to categorical function to split or why trainer why test and create that one hot encoding right so.

661
00:56:29.730 --> 00:56:32.430
Faculty Office Hours: But it does that fit every iteration of the.

662
00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:34.590
Karen Fireman: We just printed it before.

663
00:56:34.650 --> 00:56:35.550
Faculty Office Hours: It just I just put it.

664
00:56:36.210 --> 00:56:40.620
Faculty Office Hours: looks like this is actually where it's setting it to the variable be us what does this right.

665
00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.310
Karen Fireman: makes sense and we're creating the one hot encoding right here.

666
00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:47.070
Faculty Office Hours: yeah right here's where it's actually being created to be used.

667
00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:49.500
Faculty Office Hours: Not just scroll down a little bit.

668
00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:52.140
Faculty Office Hours: let's just scroll down to get to the next cell let's.

669
00:56:52.260 --> 00:57:03.300
Faculty Office Hours: Just wait to take a few minutes to wait you can't run it yet because it's still run the other one, so this is going to build it's only 4849 50 so it's going to do this five times it'll just take a minute or so.

670
00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:09.360
Karen Fireman: So just while we're waiting for that a quick question, so this is really helpful going through this i'm.

671
00:57:10.050 --> 00:57:13.050
Karen Fireman: supposed to do something with this or hold on to it, oh.

672
00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:15.150
Faculty Office Hours: Just this is just for your knowledge so.

673
00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:16.530
Faculty Office Hours: The series on you.

674
00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:28.140
Faculty Office Hours: This is just showing you if you needed to save out a tensorflow model that you built potential flow and curious, how do you do that, we save it to hdfs file type right, so this is just.

675
00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:29.670
Karen Fireman: Wait a minute what is he.

676
00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:34.440
Faculty Office Hours: will get there it's just it's a different set of a pickle or a job live.

677
00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:35.760
Karen Fireman: In another time.

678
00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:41.040
Faculty Office Hours: it's a data it's a binary data type for saving out these tensorflow models.

679
00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:57.300
Karen Fireman: yeah we heard about one hot encoding in every single class we've been in every single Professor goes through it like we never heard of it before, but this year, the first one who actually had us do it create everybody else he did it for us or told us about it, I mean we.

680
00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:09.570
Faculty Office Hours: had some of the programs just automatically do like trump will automatically do like a categorical variable right gentlemen will automatically take that categorical variable into the outer into the models.

681
00:58:09.930 --> 00:58:23.340
Faculty Office Hours: And when you build them in it, you know, like you run the aggression and you'll see the different categories right right, whereas if you're running it through Python code, you have to actually one hot encoded and create it so that you know can get it right.

682
00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:25.710
Karen Fireman: Okay did it.

683
00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:27.360
Faculty Office Hours: says done training so now.

684
00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:35.070
Faculty Office Hours: So yeah so that's just showing hey we're about 90 almost 91% accurate not bad.

685
00:58:35.310 --> 00:58:36.420
Karen Fireman: If he didn't just.

686
00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:40.470
Faculty Office Hours: get more things we get really good so now because.

687
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:42.810
Karen Fireman: We actually do here, we printed.

688
00:58:42.930 --> 00:58:45.900
Faculty Office Hours: We just print out the means squared error and the mean absolute error.

689
00:58:47.010 --> 00:58:50.340
Faculty Office Hours: So we just we just we basically looked at our test.

690
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:59.790
Faculty Office Hours: And compared what what we said we were going to predict when it came out and looked at the the mean absolute error and means squared error and printed out.

691
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:06.480
Faculty Office Hours: OK, and then so now we're at so now, if we go back up, I think we passed up so.

692
00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:08.910
Faculty Office Hours: All right, so RON maybe not.

693
00:59:10.290 --> 00:59:11.130
Karen Fireman: So, right here.

694
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:15.570
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so scroll down a little so training okay So there we go.

695
00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:18.240
Faculty Office Hours: So see that's just evaluating the model.

696
00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:23.880
Faculty Office Hours: and doing the prediction, so now we right so now if we run this sell this is a waiter predictions.

697
00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:27.450
Faculty Office Hours: So it's 90.8 that's that.

698
00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:30.810
Faculty Office Hours: my eyes are having a hard time with see what i'm looking.

699
00:59:30.810 --> 00:59:33.510
Karen Fireman: At what's the difference between down evaluate and present.

700
00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:40.020
Faculty Office Hours: So evaluate we're evaluating how we did a project for saying here's some here's some.

701
00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:54.000
Faculty Office Hours: Some predict for saying, give us this X test and take the model we built and predict what the output predict what the output would be from that model with this data set evaluate as saying hey look at the.

702
00:59:55.290 --> 00:59:57.360
Faculty Office Hours: evaluation is looking at the.

703
00:59:58.470 --> 01:00:00.570
Faculty Office Hours: The evaluate is looking at.

704
01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:08.100
Faculty Office Hours: What we said what we knew what we thought we should get you know what we should get compared to what we predicted and evaluating the accuracy.

705
01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:10.080
So.

706
01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:24.390
Faculty Office Hours: Thank you, and so, then so that's what those are so then so that's just printer valuation, how do we do, and if we go down here now that's that to that H5 file that's an html5.

707
01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:25.440
Karen Fireman: Which which room.

708
01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:30.450
Faculty Office Hours: Are you wrote, so the next cell wall is 140, so this is like pickle save you know.

709
01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:41.160
Faculty Office Hours: Job line again pickle dump yeah you're on that this is where we're taking and saying hey model that save, save this out to those binary file and then we can use the load model to reload in.

710
01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:51.150
Faculty Office Hours: Our model so now that we can then go to line 155 and pass in two new rows of data and predict against it, so if you go and run.

711
01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:53.490
Karen Fireman: Right i'm sorry what question you saved.

712
01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:56.460
Karen Fireman: But what did you yeah that's the H5 you were talking.

713
01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:01.530
Faculty Office Hours: About so yeah instead of a blog or file, this is a H5 file right makes.

714
01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.060
Faculty Office Hours: hdfs file.

715
01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:06.450
Faculty Office Hours: that's what that's what tensorflow care she's is to save out the model.

716
01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:11.070
Karen Fireman: Right i'm sorry okay all right, so, then you go here, and you run this.

717
01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:20.040
Faculty Office Hours: So they run this so this what this does is this thing what I did here is it's a little different I showed you how you can take and send an array of two axes.

718
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:31.530
Faculty Office Hours: And so you can predict out, so this is where I bring this in class and I had a brain fart and i'm like and I almost 100% positive I could probably go find the video from last year, when I was walking through the same code.

719
01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:44.070
Faculty Office Hours: I had the same brain fart and why am I not seeing one value well it's because we want hot and cold our data, and so what it's doing is predicting the probabilities of that it's class 0123456.

720
01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:45.540
Faculty Office Hours: So if you.

721
01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.320
Karen Fireman: Change one.

722
01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:52.020
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, if you look at the output on the right, you see, where I have right there leave it just like that that's perfect.

723
01:01:52.950 --> 01:02:03.060
Faculty Office Hours: So, if you look right there you'll see where I did the I did the test new so I set up a non Pio ray of just two X two roses two rows of data and then I run the predict function.

724
01:02:04.170 --> 01:02:07.380
Faculty Office Hours: You know from my model predict that's because I loaded that model in.

725
01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:13.470
Faculty Office Hours: Right and then, although I think I see a problem I should have actually said loaded model.

726
01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:18.780
Faculty Office Hours: we're technically online 162 I should have said loaded underscore model.

727
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.600
Faculty Office Hours: Because right now i'm actually just.

728
01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:28.350
Faculty Office Hours: i'm actually using the model that I created not the loaded model that I loaded a lot on.

729
01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:30.090
Karen Fireman: 40 this should say loaded.

730
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:30.960
underscore.

731
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:33.690
Karen Fireman: underscore model yeah.

732
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:36.420
Faculty Office Hours: and also the common outline 162 yeah.

733
01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:40.080
Faculty Office Hours: yeah i'll fix that and re upload it and.

734
01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:41.850
Karen Fireman: Then we should say loaded model yeah.

735
01:02:42.420 --> 01:02:43.380
Faculty Office Hours: walk through this because yeah.

736
01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:51.600
Faculty Office Hours: You see, the differences model is what I built above So if you go look when I saved out the H5 file I saved out model that save.

737
01:02:51.870 --> 01:03:04.020
Faculty Office Hours: One quality that online 48 You see, I said I created a variable called loaded model equals load model that H5 file but i'm trying to do down below it 163 is use that model that I saved.

738
01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:06.870
Karen Fireman: We shouldn't be the same if you load it.

739
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:08.040
Faculty Office Hours: it'll, be it is the exact.

740
01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:19.560
Faculty Office Hours: theory right there's the exact same model but technically what i'm trying to show here is hey I saved this out to a file, I can read load the file and and every you know and to a different variable and use it right.

741
01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:23.640
Karen Fireman: So I see, whereas before you know different variable.

742
01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:37.830
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I knew the essence of what I said model i'm just basically using the model I trained above it's the same march i'm not i'm not actually showing where hey this is, you know, this is actually meeting in that binary file and all the stuff you need in there.

743
01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:41.100
Faculty Office Hours: Right and then I heard the same one here you learned the new one.

744
01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:57.930
Faculty Office Hours: God so i'll fix my code and re uploaded and then tell everybody in class Thursday i'm not gonna send another announcement confuse people um 164 so what that does is that those those that line at 164 that's printing out those two rows of nine column 038 right.

745
01:03:58.290 --> 01:04:05.460
Faculty Office Hours: And so, if you look, you can see where it predicted that this is going to be five as predicted six for the first one.

746
01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:08.550
Karen Fireman: Seven for the secondary you Where are you looking five.

747
01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:09.840
Faculty Office Hours: Oh, and the output.

748
01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.190
Faculty Office Hours: And the output to the left.

749
01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:12.150
Karen Fireman: over here to.

750
01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:16.200
Faculty Office Hours: The right, excuse me, I met right i'm sorry carrie I meant to say right.

751
01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:18.060
Karen Fireman: that's okay i'm good i'm not.

752
01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:20.520
Faculty Office Hours: Following the numbers this year is right here.

753
01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.710
Karen Fireman: So, six and seven down here.

754
01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:36.090
Faculty Office Hours: These are what you're looking at there, so the that six and seven that's that's six and seven was output it from line 165 the two lines above six and seven for output from line 164.

755
01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:45.570
Faculty Office Hours: So what mine 164 says hey print out that why prediction knew, you did from the predict statement against the model right.

756
01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:48.300
Faculty Office Hours: Right so because it's one hot encoded the data.

757
01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:56.130
Faculty Office Hours: What prints out is the probabilities that of it being one of the being that class right.

758
01:04:56.730 --> 01:05:11.640
Faculty Office Hours: So you don't get back when it whenever it goes and builds a model that says hey I have basically effectively nine y variables and i'm product object and it puts probabilities to them right, and so what happens here is whenever I print out, you can see.

759
01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:22.290
Faculty Office Hours: Where I have 00 So if I go look at that output in the first row that output 000 that's class zero class one class to those are 000.

760
01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:32.190
Faculty Office Hours: In Class three is point oh one class forest point oh three class five is point three five plus five probabilities point four, six that's the biggest one right.

761
01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:48.720
Faculty Office Hours: And then class, you know, six and seven eight those little smaller so that was probably the highest for six and that's why six and then, if you look at the one below that the the probability is actually seven is the highest those aren't necessarily lined up in a row.

762
01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:50.910
Karen Fireman: Right, these are great and.

763
01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.770
Faculty Office Hours: Actually, it is, it is, it is it actually is.

764
01:05:52.980 --> 01:06:04.110
Faculty Office Hours: So seven is the highest so what I did is a two things I showed you what the output would be with the one hot encoding because that's what the output from the model with the predict what saves but then I use an umpire Ray called our Max.

765
01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:11.130
Faculty Office Hours: With this X is equal one and what it does, is it says okay go through each each row of that of that array.

766
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:23.610
Faculty Office Hours: And then return the position that's what art Max says turn the position that's the largest value because that position because of our categories being 03 whatever the position is.

767
01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:28.950
Faculty Office Hours: it's going to return that position that's gonna be our class and so, then I just use the V stack demand to have it.

768
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:36.540
Faculty Office Hours: turn it and pivot it and output it the same way I see it in a in a data set right so.

769
01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.940
Faculty Office Hours: The first one is six the second one is seven.

770
01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:41.040
Faculty Office Hours: Right make sense.

771
01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:43.860
Karen Fireman: yeah yeah Thank you that's very interesting.

772
01:06:44.610 --> 01:06:47.160
Faculty Office Hours: All right, what else we got because I am about out of time.

773
01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:56.490
Faculty Office Hours: anybody else broken i'm actually eight minutes over Tyler I usually don't like to stop it tonight, I have to stop.

774
01:06:58.110 --> 01:06:59.220
Faculty Office Hours: Anybody stuck.

775
01:07:00.210 --> 01:07:05.250
James Kramer: Now I mean I got you know different numbers, then the NAB it I don't know if that's because tensorflow is not working right.

776
01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.530
Faculty Office Hours: um let's just let's just share your screen real quick is that James.

777
01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:13.200
Faculty Office Hours: or C yes excellent James.

778
01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:16.380
James Kramer: that's.

779
01:07:17.970 --> 01:07:18.450
Karen Fireman: that's really.

780
01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:20.760
Faculty Office Hours: fun.

781
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:23.250
Karen Fireman: Yes.

782
01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:28.710
Faculty Office Hours: While you're doing that i'll let you see my.

783
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:31.920
Faculty Office Hours: My silly hand puppet.

784
01:07:59.430 --> 01:08:01.560
Faculty Office Hours: Sorry i'm just getting you ready.

785
01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:03.000
Faculty Office Hours: For your Professor.

786
01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:05.280
Faculty Office Hours: You think that's bad.

787
01:08:06.810 --> 01:08:10.740
Faculty Office Hours: Your next Professor after me that was the second half, he has real puppets.

788
01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.820
Faculty Office Hours: I got these because I do the volunteer teaching with high school kids.

789
01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:24.180
Faculty Office Hours: Monday Wednesday Friday and I figured that some of them would find that absolutely corny and goofy but funny you know, I was like a high school teacher.

790
01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:30.090
Faculty Office Hours: High School where your teacher the goofy stuff like that you laughed he thought was corny but deep down you're actually liked it, I thought was funny.

791
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:31.920
So.

792
01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:38.430
Faculty Office Hours: All right, so show me where you're Okay, let me throw some.

793
01:08:39.750 --> 01:08:42.330
James Kramer: yeah which screen, do you see you see my file it's where I.

794
01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:44.550
Faculty Office Hours: know I saw I saw visual studio code.

795
01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:49.470
James Kramer: Okay cuz it just like when I was looking on our show the right one right.

796
01:08:49.770 --> 01:09:02.160
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, and your output looks right it just looks like your numbers were favor and slightly towards like it like you had like six and seven six and six, I think, maybe she had six and seven is that right.

797
01:09:02.970 --> 01:09:06.060
Faculty Office Hours: yeah yeah that's just probably them how the model built.

798
01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:14.490
James Kramer: Okay, my my My biggest concern was the down at the bottom that with the problems said it was unable to what this.

799
01:09:14.730 --> 01:09:15.180
Faculty Office Hours: Show me.

800
01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:19.440
Faculty Office Hours: Show me your screen, again, I guess, I missed that I only saw for like a brief second I apologize.

801
01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:22.440
Faculty Office Hours: And i'll show your visual studio code again.

802
01:09:22.770 --> 01:09:24.300
Faculty Office Hours: Sorry, no worries.

803
01:09:27.690 --> 01:09:38.100
Faculty Office Hours: ignore that those those are that's the that's the pilot thing, and you can ignore that that problems ignore that that's just that's pilot trying to.

804
01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:42.240
Faculty Office Hours: I get the same message you can ignore that that's that that.

805
01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:53.160
Faculty Office Hours: that's pilot having an issue with the curious stuff it's not really not pilots, the is the weather call a winter and programming so that's trying to do syntax and things like that.

806
01:09:53.760 --> 01:10:00.240
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, you can ignore that that so that's why it says unable to import interior says like pilot import error.

807
01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:08.550
Faculty Office Hours: that's that's the pilot having problems trying to what it's trying to do is read that tensorflow charisse models package in.

808
01:10:08.910 --> 01:10:14.460
Faculty Office Hours: so that I can understand the structure of that package so that, when it can give you syntax highlighting and all that.

809
01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:24.360
Faculty Office Hours: So with that message is when you see that pilot and porter you can ignore that that's just that's a bug with pilot package, not being able to.

810
01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:33.630
Faculty Office Hours: Read the structure of that package so that could give you a height syntax highlighting and and you know auto completion and all that that's what that error messages.

811
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:35.190
James Kramer: yeah.

812
01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:35.670
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I.

813
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.680
Faculty Office Hours: guarantee you care no Jim clicks the.

814
01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:42.570
Faculty Office Hours: Problems there and then in There probably seen the same for errors, I get the same for us.

815
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:48.630
Faculty Office Hours: But it's nothing to do with your code being broken or the code networking right.

816
01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:54.510
Faculty Office Hours: it's that pilot package that I had to install to do the syntax highlighting and the inspection of the.

817
01:10:54.840 --> 01:11:01.950
Faculty Office Hours: package so that I can give you autocomplete it just try it and tried to inspect that package to do all that and it just kind of an error.

818
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:12.180
Faculty Office Hours: So, but basically what that means is when you're trying to to do use that package and write the code up there, and might not do the autocomplete writer and like that, but the code still will be fine.

819
01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:14.790
Faculty Office Hours: Okay anything else.

820
01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:23.940
Faculty Office Hours: Alright i'm going to end in this column day and i'll see everybody in a in a in three.

821
01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:25.440
Faculty Office Hours: three nights Thank you.

822
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:26.700
Karen Fireman: Thank you so much.

823
01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.500
James Kramer: really appreciate it or.

824
01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:29.520
Faculty Office Hours: norris like.
