1
01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:47.880
Fireman, Karen: So are we waiting.

2
01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:51.390
Faculty Office Hours: Yes.

3
01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:57.690
Fireman, Karen: I have a few initial questions for you, been I haven't finished figuring out my questions, but this is a couple of them.

4
01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:17.130
Fireman, Karen: yeah we I think we all tried to do what you told us on the mods and got that so let's kind of assume that's done, and then the rest of the project is a little bit still confusing so i'm kind of was hoping that.

5
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:31.680
Fireman, Karen: You can give us some more help on that, because just starting with the dumb stuff Okay, you said there's 10 batches okay 10 batches a month Okay, I get that there's 10 batches because each batch takes two weeks, and you have the five that's so.

6
01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:39.900
Fireman, Karen: Two weeks four weeks in a month two times five got at 10 batches um How much is it a batch I mean that's a dumb question how much is in a batch.

7
01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:46.920
Faculty Office Hours: i'm sure I understand what the question is.

8
01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:52.710
Fireman, Karen: i'm not sure I understand the question either, but I just don't understand how do we know, is it.

9
01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:54.390
Fireman, Karen: Is it.

10
01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:01.890
Fireman, Karen: 403 4350 points prevents that we used in the homework seven.

11
01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:16.560
Wright, Beth: We need to take that into account at all I kind of thought that the amounts that we were looking at or fixed for us in the data set, and then we were solving the optimization problem, given what was fixed in the data set.

12
01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:17.850
Fireman, Karen: I hope you're right.

13
01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:19.890
Faculty Office Hours: Yes, yeah.

14
01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:21.840
Wilson Pineda: Just a transportation part is it.

15
01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:25.200
Fireman, Karen: Okay, great okay so so okay.

16
01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:29.310
Faculty Office Hours: Jason the the.

17
01:02:29.790 --> 01:02:30.960
Fireman, Karen: that's the data.

18
01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:42.690
Fireman, Karen: hmm okay Okay, so let me continue with my question, then, I like your point beth, thank you for throwing that in and also Wilson um so so in the verbiage.

19
01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:46.260
Fireman, Karen: um you mentioned that there's um.

20
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:53.940
Fireman, Karen: So we don't care that there's 10 batches per month we don't care about that we don't care about is there some kind of limitation.

21
01:02:54.330 --> 01:03:06.660
Fireman, Karen: That we have to deal with and i'm not sure how to deal with, about the fact that we have the first three the light ale the whatever the three or that or that take up the three baths and then we have the two remaining that's.

22
01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:13.260
Fireman, Karen: How we use that that part and what Does that imply to us in terms of the data.

23
01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:23.790
Wright, Beth: I maybe oversimplifying, but I just added up the total number of case that would go to each delivery node.

24
01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:24.990
Fireman, Karen: And that is.

25
01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:31.080
Wright, Beth: yeah so it didn't matter necessarily what kind it was it's just that it was a keg, and it needed to go in and track.

26
01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:38.100
Fireman, Karen: Except for didn't you have different prices for different things different amounts and swap so do we just um.

27
01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:43.650
Wright, Beth: it's a time optimization problem rather than a pricing problem.

28
01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:55.110
Fireman, Karen: Well it's only that because I was just kind of wondering, are we done once we've done log into and we drop the data in or we it um obviously.

29
01:03:56.250 --> 01:04:05.610
Fireman, Karen: Not obviously I mean is, is that all it is, is that the professor, is that all there is, I would like it to be that because it's very confusing otherwise.

30
01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:10.320
Faculty Office Hours: i'm not sure what you mean, but so this.

31
01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:16.200
Fireman, Karen: With That said, I, like the best said is that issue right I.

32
01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:22.080
Faculty Office Hours: mean it's it's it's basically.

33
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:27.120
Faculty Office Hours: trying to figure out a route, the.

34
01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.120
Faculty Office Hours: route, the lovers, I mean.

35
01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.950
Fireman, Karen: We deliver the kegs.

36
01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:48.120
Fireman, Karen: yeah great Okay, and then, when we Okay, so we deliver the case is there any other thing that we have to do with revenue and i'm pricing it out, based on which kind I thought that you wanted that.

37
01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:52.650
Faculty Office Hours: No, because they're all the same.

38
01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:54.510
Fireman, Karen: Good okay.

39
01:04:55.530 --> 01:05:02.370
Fireman, Karen: Okay, so our final answer has to do with the routing and how many went into each truck.

40
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.960
Faculty Office Hours: Yes.

41
01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:05.370
fantastic.

42
01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:18.360
Fireman, Karen: fabulous Okay, so the data set you gave us that had the distances I assume this or distances between the codes that are really the nodes that are really the customers right you gave us that.

43
01:05:19.890 --> 01:05:22.770
Fireman, Karen: You had this grid that was like 20 by 20.

44
01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:29.610
Fireman, Karen: Like CBD and wp and all those guys to read the wrong data.

45
01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:31.620
Faculty Office Hours: No that's fine.

46
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:45.420
Fireman, Karen: Okay, so that data are those distances between two points, so that when there's an Arc between those two nodes you use that distance and that would be just fyi kind of distance as if we were getting charged.

47
01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:51.300
Fireman, Karen: Some rate per distance is that is that part of this or not, or what.

48
01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:54.330
Wilson Pineda: is carrying carrying forget about race and.

49
01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.250
Fireman, Karen: prices, and this is.

50
01:05:56.310 --> 01:06:10.800
Wilson Pineda: All about transportation, I think we appreciate that the Professor polar bear bus on the beginning, just as though exercise that is there just for context, I mean question is about transportation that's how you take is that right, Professor.

51
01:06:11.370 --> 01:06:17.130
Fireman, Karen: Yes, so the grid is for nothing in this particular product project we don't use that grid of numbers.

52
01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:18.750
Faculty Office Hours: Which group.

53
01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:21.090
Coleman, Clay: You yeah you need the grid.

54
01:06:22.110 --> 01:06:22.620
Fireman, Karen: would not be.

55
01:06:23.220 --> 01:06:35.220
Coleman, Clay: The top one i'm talking to you need all the the distances, I mean you got to know how far each places from each one, so you know how many miles to take on either the TRIPs and how much time it takes.

56
01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:38.430
Fireman, Karen: But I thought that was the X, Y coordinates.

57
01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:45.330
Fireman, Karen: Yes, I thought we were using the X, Y coordinates like we did in the baggage problem.

58
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:52.800
Wilson Pineda: The Dax why just to plot the screen, they are arrows and they located nothing else now.

59
01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:55.170
Wilson Pineda: They Poland optimization.

60
01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:58.590
Wilson Pineda: Point is from the from the table with the distances.

61
01:06:58.950 --> 01:07:01.440
Wright, Beth: yeah the grid your time in.

62
01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:06.900
Faculty Office Hours: accordance will help you graph the solution.

63
01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:07.740
Fireman, Karen: got it.

64
01:07:07.770 --> 01:07:08.640
Faculty Office Hours: But the.

65
01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:12.450
Faculty Office Hours: The seconds are based on.

66
01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:14.880
Faculty Office Hours: locations.

67
01:07:15.570 --> 01:07:18.540
Fireman, Karen: Those are seconds those numbers in the grid or seconds.

68
01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:22.560
Fireman, Karen: Not minutes not miles.

69
01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:25.020
Fireman, Karen: Yes.

70
01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:27.030
Faculty Office Hours: Instead of seven seconds yes.

71
01:07:29.370 --> 01:07:35.550
Fireman, Karen: So, like CB to wp or something like that that's the seconds that it takes from one place to the next.

72
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:36.330
Yes.

73
01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:37.980
Okay.

74
01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:43.560
Fireman, Karen: And that's how we optimize what was the comparison of that and the baggage.

75
01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:46.200
Fireman, Karen: I don't remember having that.

76
01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:49.170
Faculty Office Hours: database bags, who was minutes.

77
01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:51.810
Fireman, Karen: You get that same data.

78
01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:54.030
yeah with a.

79
01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:59.820
Wilson Pineda: Professor says we're talking about the distance here sorry Karen.

80
01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:00.930
Fireman, Karen: Thank you.

81
01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.270
Fireman, Karen: I appreciate it.

82
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:11.640
Wilson Pineda: I think, on the bag, so he was simple in this sense that there was a sandy stance either way you know same time.

83
01:08:12.450 --> 01:08:22.320
Wilson Pineda: And I hear you pointed out on the instructions that the distance or difference, I mean, I would like to have some data So how do you solve that you will have to, will you create.

84
01:08:23.010 --> 01:08:34.020
Wilson Pineda: More arcs that knows and will be one hour garnish this on Asia time or I mean can't Can you give us some guidance on on on how to program that.

85
01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:48.810
Wilson Pineda: On the fact that they are there differently, would you would you would you would you go through the the the matrix on on and duplicate the errors and the nose or just did the arrows.

86
01:08:50.490 --> 01:08:52.680
Faculty Office Hours: understand what you're asking um.

87
01:08:57.750 --> 01:09:02.070
Faculty Office Hours: The the distances are different.

88
01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:09.690
Faculty Office Hours: Based on the two in from and you don't need to.

89
01:09:11.790 --> 01:09:21.510
Faculty Office Hours: You don't need to make an assumption, about the fact that they're the same they're all computed I mean they're all.

90
01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:25.770
Faculty Office Hours: they're all using the API.

91
01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:33.000
Faculty Office Hours: aren't sure what your question is.

92
01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:35.850
Wright, Beth: You don't have to do anything they're.

93
01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:43.410
Wright, Beth: Just again for context of like because the model already take into account that the distances are different, yes.

94
01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:44.850
Fireman, Karen: Good good okay.

95
01:09:45.450 --> 01:09:46.440
Wilson Pineda: When you go and you.

96
01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:50.100
Wilson Pineda: You go through the matrix it will take each point differently.

97
01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:51.570
Wilson Pineda: Yes, OK.

98
01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:53.370
Fireman, Karen: OK OK.

99
01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:54.120
Fireman, Karen: And as.

100
01:09:54.720 --> 01:10:00.000
Fireman, Karen: A comparison, I do see the other one, thank you, I do see it was exactly what we had before, thank you.

101
01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:03.240
Wilson Pineda: yeah It makes sense, it makes it things, but thanks.

102
01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:04.590
Faculty Office Hours: Good.

103
01:10:05.610 --> 01:10:13.050
Wilson Pineda: And I have another question i'm working through it, it seems like the POP the brewery.

104
01:10:13.890 --> 01:10:31.530
Wilson Pineda: I mean when I do it the first pass even i'd say that it's going to use three vans when you optimize it you just have to master using one so i'm and I don't know what to expect to be one or the other there's gonna be more than one that they are final submission.

105
01:10:32.430 --> 01:10:40.140
Faculty Office Hours: Well, if you were if you were not worrying about capacity than one will be the best.

106
01:10:40.530 --> 01:10:41.460
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, because.

107
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:50.070
Faculty Office Hours: You just like I mean there's no reason to come back to the brewery yes, unless you.

108
01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:51.870
Have.

109
01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:55.200
Faculty Office Hours: That is full.

110
01:10:56.610 --> 01:11:00.930
Wilson Pineda: Okay Okay, yes, I have another capacity that's probably why yes.

111
01:11:01.230 --> 01:11:02.730
Wilson Pineda: Yes, okay thanks.

112
01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:11.610
Coleman, Clay: I had one last I had one quick question on.

113
01:11:12.660 --> 01:11:21.360
Coleman, Clay: there's five bullets towards the bottom, and it was the weather, you can provide an estimate on how close your solution is to some best notion.

114
01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:32.160
Coleman, Clay: Of How exactly do you want us to go about answering that is that, just like Is it the you know, are we saying it's the optimal are we saying it's close, or is it like a.

115
01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:36.840
Coleman, Clay: That that that was I was just more curious on that portion.

116
01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:38.250
Faculty Office Hours: Sure, so.

117
01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:42.030
Faculty Office Hours: I guess, this is kind of test your.

118
01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:46.620
Faculty Office Hours: Your knowledge of what the.

119
01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:51.150
Faculty Office Hours: What the solvers able to tell you.

120
01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:52.020
Okay.

121
01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:56.970
Coleman, Clay: So it's like the the towards the gap stuff that we were talking about.

122
01:11:56.970 --> 01:11:57.390
Faculty Office Hours: Yes.

123
01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:00.540
Coleman, Clay: Yes, okay very good, I just wanted, I just want to make sure.

124
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:01.770
Faculty Office Hours: yeah good.

125
01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:06.870
Fireman, Karen: Oh that's how we're supposed to use those questions that's really a hell.

126
01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:13.470
Fireman, Karen: Okay, I couldn't figure that out, I thought we were just like coming out of like just theorizing it.

127
01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:19.320
Faculty Office Hours: depends on how you solve the problem, because you can solve the problem.

128
01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:24.960
Faculty Office Hours: Without using a model than you can't make a claim.

129
01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:31.740
Fireman, Karen: But because we have the model we actually can use the model to answer those questions.

130
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:32.940
Yes.

131
01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:35.880
Fireman, Karen: Oh.

132
01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:42.090
Wilson Pineda: Professor and the loading time the two to three minutes that also context, or do you want to add that, to the model.

133
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:44.820
Faculty Office Hours: Oh i'm sorry, what did you say.

134
01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:56.460
Wilson Pineda: They lost in time that truck and they all are in a lot in the truck to three minutes per K, is that just context that you want to add that, to the model as well.

135
01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.770
Faculty Office Hours: Will I mean it depends on.

136
01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:05.730
Faculty Office Hours: So let's let's say that the loading and loading time was.

137
01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:09.870
Faculty Office Hours: I don't know like 20 minutes.

138
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:16.050
Faculty Office Hours: Then would that affect a solution, you have or or not.

139
01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:22.050
Fireman, Karen: We can do some modifications to figure it out is that what you're thinking like outside of the model to.

140
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:29.550
Faculty Office Hours: do some well i'm saying that if if the if the loading and loading time was like 20 minutes, then.

141
01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:31.320
Faculty Office Hours: or.

142
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:34.140
Faculty Office Hours: or or.

143
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:38.400
Faculty Office Hours: Whatever seconds, then.

144
01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:47.700
Faculty Office Hours: That might change how many days you want to rent the vehicle for or.

145
01:13:52.530 --> 01:14:00.510
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, it doesn't affect the optimization it affects the kind of like interpretation of their results.

146
01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:02.070
Wilson Pineda: Okay.

147
01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:03.660
Wilson Pineda: It makes sense.

148
01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:09.360
Fireman, Karen: So that's outside the model but it's using the model to do some analysis is that what you're saying.

149
01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:17.220
Faculty Office Hours: Well it's like kind of outside the model but it's kind of asking you to kind of use common sense.

150
01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:19.200
Fireman, Karen: yeah.

151
01:14:19.770 --> 01:14:24.990
Wilson Pineda: yeah because the model is now is now is we don't have to.

152
01:14:27.090 --> 01:14:27.510
me.

153
01:14:29.970 --> 01:14:42.660
Faculty Office Hours: that the amount of time that you spend at each unloading and loading each keg, I mean obviously affects I mean obviously affects the.

154
01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:47.730
Faculty Office Hours: The amount of time, it will take, but it doesn't affect the.

155
01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:50.310
Faculty Office Hours: routing.

156
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:54.390
Wilson Pineda: yeah same makes sense, thanks, Professor make sense.

157
01:14:54.840 --> 01:15:03.360
Faculty Office Hours: But, but if it makes the difference between like one day of rain, the truck or two days of renting the truck you know that that makes the difference.

158
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:12.120
Fireman, Karen: But you're saying to do that, outside the model and use some common sense related to that is that yes.

159
01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:41.070
Fireman, Karen: So all those things were common sense things about the three the three vats for their particular item, those were context, the other items the 10 batches the all that was just context.

160
01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:42.960
Faculty Office Hours: Yes, oh.

161
01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:48.480
Fireman, Karen: Fantastic now you understand if I was trying to put a model around all that why I was getting a bit concerned.

162
01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:52.590
Fireman, Karen: Thank you, I guess you understood, I think.

163
01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:58.710
Wilson Pineda: For sure i'm on the first page, the second to last bullet point um.

164
01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:02.250
Wilson Pineda: Would you mind to kind of.

165
01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:11.250
Wilson Pineda: provide some insight about that that the point how, how will they, how will they.

166
01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:12.030
Karen Fireman: Be for some.

167
01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:14.550
Wilson Pineda: Time will make that you don't have.

168
01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:25.620
Wilson Pineda: To be in the same location, we will not live on the same place, I I see what they do sentences meaning but I don't see a link between the two.

169
01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:29.880
Faculty Office Hours: i'm sorry your your your link is kind of.

170
01:16:31.290 --> 01:16:33.540
Faculty Office Hours: Yes, you can see again.

171
01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:38.340
Wilson Pineda: On on the first page the the the bullet point the one in the middle.

172
01:16:39.450 --> 01:16:47.550
Wilson Pineda: Regarding the delivery model and then talking about the Google maps and I understand what the first sentence of that bullet point means.

173
01:16:48.210 --> 01:17:03.090
Wilson Pineda: And I understand what the second sentence means, but I don't know what is the meaning of this those two together, I mean well, what does the has to do, that the transit times are calculated by Google with the fact that you're not going to be see the same that the move.

174
01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:07.440
Wilson Pineda: The noise is going to be visiting multiple times.

175
01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:11.520
Faculty Office Hours: Well, consider your solution.

176
01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:13.950
Faculty Office Hours: Your solution has.

177
01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:16.560
Faculty Office Hours: Four trips.

178
01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:21.180
Faculty Office Hours: doesn't matter which order there.

179
01:17:23.610 --> 01:17:26.370
Faculty Office Hours: Which order you go in.

180
01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:35.310
Faculty Office Hours: I mean, I have, I mean, I have a little little experience for Houston traffic but.

181
01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:39.810
Faculty Office Hours: It seems like certain times of the day, or.

182
01:17:41.130 --> 01:17:43.560
Faculty Office Hours: it's it's it's a challenge.

183
01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:44.940
Faculty Office Hours: But.

184
01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.760
Faculty Office Hours: I guess the question is.

185
01:17:49.170 --> 01:17:50.160
Faculty Office Hours: Does it matter.

186
01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:03.150
Wilson Pineda: Okay, I went when I say it.

187
01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:06.600
Faculty Office Hours: doesn't matter doesn't matter you know what.

188
01:18:08.490 --> 01:18:12.720
Faculty Office Hours: Does the transit time depend on the time of day.

189
01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:19.020
Fireman, Karen: yeah what I mean sometimes.

190
01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:27.150
Wilson Pineda: So, so what you're trying to say is that I will likely, the solution will never pass the same point twice.

191
01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:32.100
Wilson Pineda: On around.

192
01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:36.840
Faculty Office Hours: i'm not sure I understand your.

193
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:39.180
Faculty Office Hours: characterization.

194
01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:41.250
Wilson Pineda: I yes.

195
01:18:43.020 --> 01:18:52.620
Wilson Pineda: He saying on device delivery model there's some pre processing dawn to guarantee that you know pass twice multiple times on this through the say no.

196
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:54.390
Wilson Pineda: You didn't write it for sentence.

197
01:18:54.540 --> 01:19:04.080
Wilson Pineda: yeah the second sentence, as in case of the oldest are the brewery the transit time calculated by Google maps we didn't serve this is the case.

198
01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.750
Wilson Pineda: Why does it have to be one thing with the other one.

199
01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:13.980
Faculty Office Hours: i'm not sure I understand what you're asking.

200
01:19:16.050 --> 01:19:25.740
Wilson Pineda: and asking for is how the Google map times are going to influence that you will not pass the same location twice as opposed to the first exercise on the bags delivery.

201
01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:40.530
Faculty Office Hours: Oh okay well, that the fact that the distances are calculated by Google maps will ensure that you don't have to worry about.

202
01:19:42.450 --> 01:19:59.010
Faculty Office Hours: Visiting more than one place, the same number of times so i'm just saying that you don't have to worry about that because there because the distances obey was called the triangle of want inequality.

203
01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:12.030
Wilson Pineda: Okay, so this is more like a like a context i'm bullet point about we don't have to do anything about it.

204
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:18.510
Faculty Office Hours: i'm just telling you that you don't have to worry about the distances.

205
01:20:19.650 --> 01:20:21.330
Faculty Office Hours: Yes, yes.

206
01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:23.790
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, you don't have to worry about it but.

207
01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:27.330
Faculty Office Hours: But at the same time i'm i'm.

208
01:20:33.090 --> 01:20:34.860
Faculty Office Hours: Fine okay good.

209
01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.170
Wilson Pineda: thanks for your.

210
01:20:37.890 --> 01:20:45.420
Karen Fireman: Question also Professor i'm sorry now it's getting my software together here, by the way, thank you, sorry i'm a little frazzled on.

211
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:56.580
Karen Fireman: The so the questions you have after the after the bullet points you have the degree to which the stated restrictions are satisfied is 75 points and then you have.

212
01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:07.980
Karen Fireman: The realize total transit time penalized by meaningful violations of the restrictions which kind of violations are we thinking about, for example.

213
01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:18.300
Faculty Office Hours: Well let's say you, you were out the vehicles in such a way that you have more than 29 kegs on the vehicle.

214
01:21:19.710 --> 01:21:30.900
Faculty Office Hours: That would be a That would be a I mean that would be infeasible right but I don't want to like totally.

215
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:44.400
Faculty Office Hours: I don't want to penalize that in such a way that I don't reward you from getting partial credit from getting unfeasible.

216
01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:49.170
Faculty Office Hours: So that's What I mean is that make it clear.

217
01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:52.470
Karen Fireman: yeah I just want to make sure I was clear on.

218
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:54.300
Faculty Office Hours: The things that are the path yeah and I.

219
01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:56.340
Karen Fireman: Like.

220
01:21:56.430 --> 01:21:59.820
Faculty Office Hours: rod the vehicles and you did a great job, and it was just.

221
01:21:59.910 --> 01:22:03.540
Faculty Office Hours: Fantastic but it had more than you know, like.

222
01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:09.420
Faculty Office Hours: More than 30 kegs at a time, then that would be bad.

223
01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:12.210
Faculty Office Hours: But I want to give you partial credit for that.

224
01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:22.740
Karen Fireman: Another question I have at the bottom, you talk about what we can send you and i'm not sure that we have a data item Arc trips.

225
01:22:24.090 --> 01:22:28.800
Karen Fireman: Data set variables origin destination trip number.

226
01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:30.930
Karen Fireman: So.

227
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:36.900
Karen Fireman: Are you talking about a print out, we can give you is that what you're talking about or something different.

228
01:22:36.990 --> 01:22:39.090
Faculty Office Hours: i'm talking about a SAS data is that.

229
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:52.110
Karen Fireman: and creating a data set that has the origin and destination and the trip number that it's in your this truck number is that what you mean the truck number.

230
01:22:52.830 --> 01:23:00.090
Faculty Office Hours: Well, I mean you call it what you want, but it's like the it's it's the trick tip number or truck number or whatever you want to call it.

231
01:23:01.410 --> 01:23:05.190
Faculty Office Hours: it's because they're different in different.

232
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.890
Karen Fireman: what's.

233
01:23:11.610 --> 01:23:13.140
Faculty Office Hours: The origin.

234
01:23:13.890 --> 01:23:16.200
Karen Fireman: Okay, so, is it sort of like in the baggage where.

235
01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:21.750
Karen Fireman: We had a city, a city and then a time is that kind of similar to what you're talking about.

236
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:29.250
Faculty Office Hours: No.

237
01:23:30.630 --> 01:23:33.990
Karen Fireman: Okay, so I don't know what you're talking about them it's not quite that.

238
01:23:34.020 --> 01:23:37.170
Faculty Office Hours: So what i'm telling you that I want from you is that.

239
01:23:38.010 --> 01:23:38.430
Oh.

240
01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:40.500
Karen Fireman: you're a.

241
01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:43.920
Faculty Office Hours: livery model, you have different.

242
01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:45.240
Karen Fireman: yeah.

01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:47.250
Faculty Office Hours: You have different fans.

244
01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:49.320
Karen Fireman: Like okay i'm with you you're talking about us Arc.

245
01:23:50.940 --> 01:24:04.410
Karen Fireman: Arc us or us Arc Okay, yes, and then the particular particular notes okay I got it Okay, and then the next one node and trip number OK OK, I think I get that all right, so you want us to create these data sets.

246
01:24:04.770 --> 01:24:08.370
Faculty Office Hours: yeah and i'll let you know if there is a look good.

247
01:24:09.630 --> 01:24:17.460
Karen Fireman: And then, what is the output of this model do I understand that we send you the results Is that correct.

248
01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:28.560
Faculty Office Hours: Will you send me their results to make sure that they are like common sense, yes, but in terms of.

249
01:24:29.850 --> 01:24:33.990
Faculty Office Hours: The results for the client, I mean that's kind of.

250
01:24:35.010 --> 01:24:36.480
Faculty Office Hours: it's a little bit different right.

251
01:24:36.570 --> 01:24:39.540
Karen Fireman: No i'm asking a different question when we're done let's say.

252
01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:45.210
Karen Fireman: Right, this second we were finished and we wanted to send it to you very funny right I get that but, if we were ready right now.

253
01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:57.030
Karen Fireman: We would send you a PDF of the output of the log and the Code and the answers to the questions is that the output, we sent you.

254
01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:00.330
Karen Fireman: Two were to respond to the project.

255
01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:05.580
Faculty Office Hours: Well, in the in the meantime, you would send me the data sets.

256
01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:08.100
Karen Fireman: yeah but if suppose we already knew that we had it right.

257
01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:18.390
Faculty Office Hours: If you had everything right, you would send me a PDF of kind of basically what you would send to the client.

258
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:23.220
Karen Fireman: i'm sorry, but we would send to the client oh shoot.

259
01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:24.540
Karen Fireman: What are we sending to the client.

260
01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:28.260
Faculty Office Hours: and tell them how to route their vehicles right, I mean that's.

261
01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:30.090
Karen Fireman: Okay, but it's the results it's.

262
01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:36.420
Karen Fireman: The results isn't isn't the isn't the isn't the results of the output right, I mean that's, that is what you would send them.

263
01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:38.520
Yes.

264
01:25:39.570 --> 01:25:40.170
Faculty Office Hours: I mean.

265
01:25:40.710 --> 01:25:46.800
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I mean, are you going to send you a file, or are you going to send them, you know kind of the question is.

266
01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:54.300
Faculty Office Hours: you're asking what kind of what what they would expect to see.

267
01:25:55.470 --> 01:26:04.380
Karen Fireman: yeah i'm asking what do we, what do we sent you yeah what's the what's the deliverable what do we send you at the end when we're done, what is the deliverable to you what does it look like.

268
01:26:05.670 --> 01:26:07.860
Faculty Office Hours: I would expect that you would send me.

269
01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:12.840
Faculty Office Hours: A PDF or a Doc file.

270
01:26:14.850 --> 01:26:15.900
Faculty Office Hours: That would have.

271
01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:19.110
Faculty Office Hours: graphs.

272
01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:23.400
Faculty Office Hours: And and those could be you know.

273
01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:29.580
Faculty Office Hours: The graphs could be PDF files or they could be.

274
01:26:31.110 --> 01:26:32.400
Faculty Office Hours: Part of your Doc file.

275
01:26:32.910 --> 01:26:34.590
Karen Fireman: So those are the arrow things right.

276
01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:43.560
Karen Fireman: yeah okay so so Chad, the arrow things with different clients right so that'll be the last one that that's good that we like.

277
01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:46.560
Karen Fireman: Right.

278
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:55.110
Faculty Office Hours: I mean you're telling them how to how to deliver your tags right, so they want to know, you know how to do it.

279
01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.490
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, I mean so that they're.

280
01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:08.130
Faculty Office Hours: they're looking for kind of general directions and can this specific.

281
01:27:10.230 --> 01:27:16.260
Faculty Office Hours: depend dependent on demand actually.

282
01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.230
Karen Fireman: Is anybody else having trouble, or is it just me.

283
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:28.290
Karen Fireman: You got this.

284
01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:30.420
Karen Fireman: Okay, good.

285
01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:31.980
Jim Clark: I.

286
01:27:33.390 --> 01:27:40.020
Faculty Office Hours: mean I guess you know, try and put your your mind in the in the place of the the.

287
01:27:40.230 --> 01:27:40.590
Karen Fireman: cells from.

288
01:27:40.650 --> 01:27:44.100
Faculty Office Hours: The brewery amy what do they want to know okay.

289
01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:55.740
Wright, Beth: Just a report i'm just thinking about it, like like doing a doing a White Paper report and where you just want to answer all the questions that he's.

290
01:27:56.460 --> 01:28:04.380
Wright, Beth: asked the additional questions, in addition to making sure that you highlight the the specific asked to the project meaning, like the total time and.

291
01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:07.530
Wright, Beth: The number of trucks and.

292
01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:21.870
Karen Fireman: Okay okay like that you're right a little report about what it already says that in the more concise version that that it prints out Thank you okay I gotcha and the answers to the questions what they would want to say thank you thanks for the.

293
01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:34.230
Wilson Pineda: recap, Professor he does, on the question you probably say that, so the units on the on the table are those some eggs or those are Volume I mean.

294
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:38.700
Faculty Office Hours: This is Wilson yes.

295
01:28:40.890 --> 01:28:44.550
Faculty Office Hours: So i'm not understand your question.

296
01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:48.750
Wilson Pineda: On the unit on the customer data on the data file.

297
01:28:49.890 --> 01:28:56.910
Wilson Pineda: For the monthly the those are monthly delivery and those are kegs the quantities I don't care the quantities.

298
01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:01.740
Faculty Office Hours: Yes, it's it's kegs that we've monthly yes.

299
01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:03.240
Wilson Pineda: Thank you.

300
01:29:08.610 --> 01:29:14.070
Karen Fireman: The stuff in the boxes, where they seconds or minutes in the box, that the boxes were seconds three.

301
01:29:15.090 --> 01:29:16.020
Faculty Office Hours: seconds yes.

302
01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:17.250
Karen Fireman: Thank you, sorry.

303
01:29:17.730 --> 01:29:19.560
Faculty Office Hours: And that only has.

304
01:29:21.090 --> 01:29:23.670
Faculty Office Hours: meaning in the context of.

305
01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.560
Faculty Office Hours: The time it takes to load and unload.

306
01:29:30.210 --> 01:29:33.120
Faculty Office Hours: As far as your solution.

307
01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:39.960
Faculty Office Hours: I mean, it may be that, like.

308
01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:50.790
Faculty Office Hours: most fabulous routing of all but you still have to load and unload the kegs and.

309
01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:52.710
Karen Fireman: That we would have to have that.

310
01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:54.180
Faculty Office Hours: difference between like.

311
01:29:55.410 --> 01:30:01.890
Faculty Office Hours: You have the truck for one day or you have the truck for two days kind of yeah okay.

312
01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:11.280
Karen Fireman: which we can we get that from looking through the data and analyzing it and saying Oh well, we would need the truck for an extra day because of all this extra time or we wouldn't.

313
01:30:11.670 --> 01:30:13.080
Karen Fireman: yeah God, thank you.

314
01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:14.160
Good.

315
01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:32.340
Wright, Beth: So, Professor when I was running through the constraint right the constraint were saying you only have 29 K, I was having a lot of.

316
01:30:33.690 --> 01:30:39.660
Wright, Beth: A lot of problem with the constraint and realize that the reason was in creating the.

317
01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:51.690
Wright, Beth: In the imputed variable or trying to figure out the total number of bags I had been referencing notes, instead of delivery nodes and.

318
01:30:52.080 --> 01:31:05.910
Wright, Beth: I couldn't for the life of me figure out why that was a problem, and in the model itself because nodes and delivery nodes were the same to me in the bag, this is in fixing the baggage problem we get that figured out but um.

319
01:31:06.930 --> 01:31:17.490
Wright, Beth: Do you like, I still can't wrap my head around why it worked with delivery nodes but now, maybe that's because the note the nomenclature was just too close and they're really different things, but.

320
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:22.230
Karen Fireman: Also delivery nodes not have Heathrow in it, it doesn't have the depot.

321
01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:27.630
Faculty Office Hours: Will it depends on whether you're looking at the.

322
01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:31.170
Faculty Office Hours: Like the the British version or the.

323
01:31:32.970 --> 01:31:37.440
Faculty Office Hours: Or the Houston version, but the.

324
01:31:39.330 --> 01:31:47.940
Faculty Office Hours: Delivery nodes don't consider the depot so in terms of the.

325
01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:51.360
Faculty Office Hours: The problem you're trying to solve.

326
01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:54.330
Faculty Office Hours: You don't really care.

327
01:31:55.380 --> 01:32:12.270
Faculty Office Hours: about the depot you don't care about how many kegs they need at the depot because they're there, I mean it's just like you know, like I locked the door, and there are the kegs there.

328
01:32:13.350 --> 01:32:18.660
Faculty Office Hours: So you don't need you don't need to deliver kegs anywhere.

329
01:32:21.090 --> 01:32:22.770
Faculty Office Hours: But the delivery nodes.

330
01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:27.210
Faculty Office Hours: So.

331
01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:29.130
Faculty Office Hours: If.

332
01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:30.270
If.

333
01:32:32.250 --> 01:32:32.880
Wright, Beth: Any.

334
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:39.750
Faculty Office Hours: depot if you include the depot then you're kind of like.

335
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.280
Faculty Office Hours: Making the problem harder than it needs to be.

336
01:32:47.130 --> 01:32:57.870
Wright, Beth: right and it makes sense that it wouldn't have worked, because I, when I restricted the number of trucks Israelis and the way we were to choose number of tracks or trips would be to.

337
01:32:58.110 --> 01:33:04.350
Wright, Beth: Take the phone number of tags that we knew we needed to deliver and divide them up by the number of case in.

338
01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:12.420
Faculty Office Hours: The the the the the kegs that we're going to the the brewery.

339
01:33:13.290 --> 01:33:16.230
Faculty Office Hours: yeah be yeah there will be kind of like over.

340
01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:21.750
Faculty Office Hours: It you don't you didn't deliver those tags.

341
01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:23.400
Wright, Beth: Sorry.

342
01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:24.450
Faculty Office Hours: ignore them.

343
01:33:27.930 --> 01:33:31.830
Karen Fireman: pretty much ignore the empties altogether right, I mean that's kind of like a given.

344
01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:48.120
Faculty Office Hours: Yes, yes, I mean based on the characteristics of the truck and the problem, yes, you don't need to worry about the the empties coming back because you always have more.

345
01:33:49.770 --> 01:33:57.660
Faculty Office Hours: I mean you're gonna you're gonna I mean presumably they're not too many difference, but you always have.

346
01:33:58.890 --> 01:34:01.830
Faculty Office Hours: Plenty of space for the empties coming back.

347
01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:14.760
Karen Fireman: yeah in this problem, the way you did it, it was just context, but in some other problem if we had a different limitation, etc, it could be an issue, not just problem.

348
01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:17.160
Faculty Office Hours: Yes, that is correct, yes.

349
01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:21.660
Wright, Beth: I also have.

350
01:34:22.890 --> 01:34:43.020
Wright, Beth: On run times so when when I started working on the the actual brewery delivery problem I noticed that when I put in the number, especially as you increase the number of trucks you increase the complexity of the models potato really long time to run.

351
01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:55.470
Wright, Beth: And, and sometimes like this visualization kind of says it has a problem in just producing that many graphs and without expected in your results that it would take a really long time to run.

352
01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:19.710
Faculty Office Hours: It takes a reasonably long time to run and if you increase the number of of vehicles, it could take you know quite a long time to run I mean if you look said, if there were 10 vehicles or more than that yeah it could it could it could take a long time to run.

353
01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:28.830
Wright, Beth: is inherently mean that I made a mistake doesn't mean I didn't make a mistake for nine years.

354
01:35:29.250 --> 01:35:35.010
Faculty Office Hours: If it if it works with for vehicles or for vans and.

355
01:35:37.170 --> 01:35:44.430
Faculty Office Hours: And, and it takes much longer for 10, then I wouldn't worry about yes, that is a problem yeah.

356
01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:02.220
Faculty Office Hours: I definitely wouldn't want to take more than 10 trips on that down.

357
01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:17.910
Wright, Beth: But I assume, though, that tinkering with the number of vehicles is something that we can do to determine if there are there is a more optimal number of vehicles.

358
01:36:18.210 --> 01:36:21.780
Faculty Office Hours: yeah you could but but keep in mind that.

359
01:36:22.950 --> 01:36:27.960
Faculty Office Hours: When you consider the solution with one vehicle when Bam.

360
01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:30.960
Faculty Office Hours: It gives you.

361
01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:34.620
Faculty Office Hours: A smaller transit time.

362
01:36:36.330 --> 01:36:38.310
Faculty Office Hours: Because i'm.

363
01:36:39.420 --> 01:36:44.310
Faculty Office Hours: Not well, I mean if you don't worry about the capacity of the bands.

364
01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:54.960
Faculty Office Hours: If if they're like big vans and you don't worry about how many cakes can go on there then there's no reason to go back to the depot.

365
01:36:57.270 --> 01:37:00.930
Faculty Office Hours: genius know what I mean it'd be that just takes more time.

366
01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:02.370
Faculty Office Hours: So.

367
01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:12.330
Faculty Office Hours: Then one one van or one vehicle is got always be the best solution.

368
01:37:14.490 --> 01:37:21.810
Wright, Beth: Is that true if you're going between three and four between four and five, as well the smallest number bands so it's going to be the moral.

369
01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:31.560
Faculty Office Hours: Yes, I mean in in still you unless you start to introduce capacity.

370
01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:45.750
Faculty Office Hours: I mean just think about it, I mean you go from you know A to B, or you go back to the to the depot and then go back to be it's always better to go.

371
01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:48.420
Wright, Beth: that's not always true.

372
01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:54.720
Faculty Office Hours: But when when you have a class and you may need more than one.

373
01:37:55.740 --> 01:37:59.790
Faculty Office Hours: trip, or more than one vehicle or however you want to think about it.

374
01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:03.690
Wilson Pineda: Now, can you make it.

375
01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:05.610
For a while we sorry.

376
01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:10.260
Wilson Pineda: i'm you have to deliver some one day.

377
01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:22.950
Wilson Pineda: So even if you have any definitely capacity can be your seniors one bass and you good they one half or whatever you do the model chosen the to the rest.

378
01:38:26.010 --> 01:38:28.860
Faculty Office Hours: i'm sorry I did not understand the question.

379
01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:37.620
Wilson Pineda: No it's Okay, I think that will come probably on the on the on the business bar don't know.

380
01:38:38.730 --> 01:38:41.610
Wilson Pineda: I think I thought through it and I think this.

381
01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:47.850
Wilson Pineda: is not part of the limitation my problem or a part of part of the business and they ran all the lines.

382
01:38:49.770 --> 01:38:53.160
Faculty Office Hours: yeah if there wasn't a capacity on the on the bands.

383
01:38:54.510 --> 01:39:05.430
Faculty Office Hours: So, if he could have as many kegs as you wanted to on the band's then one van or one trip would be the best route.

384
01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:14.880
Alejandro Chacon: Professor I have a question, do you have one example where you show the code to.

385
01:39:16.290 --> 01:39:28.680
Alejandro Chacon: Two mile in the capacity that we have to implementing in this because it because I the guy but I don't I don't know the way to to link the constraint.

386
01:39:30.150 --> 01:39:34.200
Alejandro Chacon: They have to apply to a split the the.

387
01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:53.430
Alejandro Chacon: The point where he say he he cannot be the note and say Okay, this is a maximum capacity, they have to chase to come back to their base and can I know I have to be.

388
01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:56.640
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so um.

389
01:39:57.720 --> 01:39:59.250
Faculty Office Hours: let's think about the.

390
01:40:00.930 --> 01:40:08.010
Faculty Office Hours: The vehicle routing problem, the baggage delivery problem where they have.

391
01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:10.590
Faculty Office Hours: At most.

392
01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:14.490
Faculty Office Hours: A certain amount of time.

393
01:40:16.110 --> 01:40:17.160
Faculty Office Hours: For each van.

394
01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:19.560
Alejandro Chacon: Okay.

395
01:40:19.890 --> 01:40:25.590
Faculty Office Hours: and try and translate that into instead of the most amount of.

396
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:28.500
Faculty Office Hours: Time.

397
01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:35.310
Faculty Office Hours: The most amount of bags that can be.

398
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:40.320
Faculty Office Hours: In the band so it's just a question of.

399
01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:44.850
Faculty Office Hours: kind of redefining the implicit variable.

400
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:50.370
Faculty Office Hours: To compute a different quantity.

401
01:40:51.030 --> 01:41:06.030
Alejandro Chacon: So, at the end you want to minimize all the time, but you have to put that the the cost, again, there is a number of gets the total number of cats that you.

402
01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:06.570
Faculty Office Hours: can do.

403
01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:07.980
Alejandro Chacon: They leave anybody knows node.

404
01:41:08.250 --> 01:41:11.340
Faculty Office Hours: should be at most a certain amount yes.

405
01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:14.190
Alejandro Chacon: yeah bio know how to make this.

406
01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:17.370
Alejandro Chacon: Ah, because again.

407
01:41:19.170 --> 01:41:21.570
Alejandro Chacon: I can send you the code is why why.

408
01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:24.210
Faculty Office Hours: Are my clothes me the code that been fine but.

409
01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:29.280
Faculty Office Hours: If you can calculate the number of eggs that are required uh huh.

410
01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:30.270
Alejandro Chacon: I did that.

411
01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:33.270
Faculty Office Hours: They made that possible by.

412
01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:38.130
Alejandro Chacon: I calculate the total cats by customer.

413
01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:56.700
Alejandro Chacon: And with this one, I get the I know that okay in each know, I have to deliver this kit and this one gave me, I still got time guys a low and low multiply by the Skype but I don't know how to split the.

414
01:41:57.750 --> 01:42:00.390
Alejandro Chacon: cartel a maximum number of gets.

415
01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:04.890
Faculty Office Hours: Well, if you can calculate the number of kegs.

416
01:42:06.450 --> 01:42:20.010
Faculty Office Hours: By by vehicle or by a trip, then you should be able to use that same amount to making a constraint.

417
01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:24.960
Faculty Office Hours: I mean.

418
01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:38.970
Faculty Office Hours: If you can print the print the value and you can calculate it, then you should be able to to make sure that it's not more than a certain value.

419
01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:55.920
Alejandro Chacon: yeah I can paint pick the them them them among of get that will be or how I have to delivering some.

420
01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:59.280
Alejandro Chacon: With some costumer but.

421
01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:09.210
Alejandro Chacon: I don't know how to make this because I tried to add this and they give you the total number of cat, but this is for one hour.

422
01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:13.830
Alejandro Chacon: So when when I do when it got to split the tiles.

423
01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:26.790
Alejandro Chacon: They don't find any solution the, this is the problem without a solution say this, the output, so I don't know, maybe it's a constraint is no corporate.

424
01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:41.730
Faculty Office Hours: So so let's think about the number of stops so one of the constraints in the model concerns number of stops it because of the symmetries in the problem.

425
01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:58.380
Faculty Office Hours: It helps to solve it to say that the number of stops in the first vehicle is more than the number of stops or or, at most, the number of stops in the second vehicle.

426
01:43:59.670 --> 01:44:00.210
Faculty Office Hours: Right.

427
01:44:01.470 --> 01:44:02.010
Faculty Office Hours: and

428
01:44:03.450 --> 01:44:08.250
Faculty Office Hours: The m the implicit variable that calculates the number of stops.

429
01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:15.360
Faculty Office Hours: You could easily translate if you have the data available.

430
01:44:16.410 --> 01:44:22.260
Faculty Office Hours: Instead of the number of stops available number of stops made the number of.

431
01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:24.330
Faculty Office Hours: bags.

432
01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:30.180
Faculty Office Hours: or capacity, whatever you want to call it.

433
01:44:31.470 --> 01:44:31.980
Alejandro Chacon: OK.

434
01:44:33.150 --> 01:44:33.690
Faculty Office Hours: OK.

435
01:44:34.410 --> 01:44:43.140
Alejandro Chacon: So I have to take the this guy dies desktops and change it by capacity does is a.

436
01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:48.150
Faculty Office Hours: Will I would say, change the implicit variable.

437
01:44:48.270 --> 01:44:48.720
Alejandro Chacon: uh huh.

438
01:44:49.140 --> 01:45:03.960
Faculty Office Hours: So that it in, in addition to the number of stops it calculates the capacity in a row bags of kegs and then.

439
01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:08.970
Faculty Office Hours: use that.

440
01:45:10.110 --> 01:45:11.580
Faculty Office Hours: Implicit variable.

441
01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:12.810
Okay.

442
01:45:13.950 --> 01:45:17.310
Faculty Office Hours: To come up with a constraint.

443
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.870
Okay, I.

444
01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:22.530
Faculty Office Hours: mean so like we had a constraint that says.

445
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:31.650
Faculty Office Hours: The total time in the baggage delivery model is at most 100 minutes.

446
01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:33.690
Alejandro Chacon: Yes, yes.

447
01:45:34.740 --> 01:45:55.320
Faculty Office Hours: So you should be able to come up with a similar constraint that says that, instead of the total number of transit, time is less than or equal to 100 Minutes that total capacity of each vehicle is that most.

448
01:45:57.570 --> 01:45:58.410
Faculty Office Hours: kegs.

449
01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:09.420
Alejandro Chacon: Exactly, but the point is the a you have different note on the different each know has.

450
01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:14.100
Alejandro Chacon: A specific demand so when when.

451
01:46:16.110 --> 01:46:27.720
Alejandro Chacon: Does the soul bear make the their own say okay this these five note has this X capacity dice less than that no one.

452
01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:41.250
Alejandro Chacon: If I pass this one, I need to come back to the base and go make another trip I don't know how to make this constraint, this is the point.

453
01:46:43.470 --> 01:46:46.530
Faculty Office Hours: i'm not clear on what you're asking.

454
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:50.970
Alejandro Chacon: Okay, the question is.

455
01:46:53.370 --> 01:46:55.950
Alejandro Chacon: I can define the empower empower bar.

456
01:46:57.210 --> 01:47:02.010
Alejandro Chacon: barbell they say Okay, the the the total.

457
01:47:03.570 --> 01:47:21.540
Alejandro Chacon: capacity is equal to the a demand of a each note Okay, and this half the construction that will be less than 29 there is a maximum capacity die, I can low in the in the each tower.

458
01:47:22.530 --> 01:47:24.180
Alejandro Chacon: So when it when they.

459
01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:31.950
Alejandro Chacon: I don't know how to make to the tape to make the program to say when is achieve this.

460
01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:44.580
Alejandro Chacon: go back to their base and low that make a new car because they have to go to come back to the the database and make on your own, or we need to put that.

461
01:47:45.870 --> 01:47:49.110
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, let me try and interpret this in a different way.

462
01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:52.020
Faculty Office Hours: Each trip.

463
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:54.060
Faculty Office Hours: Yes, Nicole.

464
01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:56.130
Faculty Office Hours: makes.

465
01:47:58.170 --> 01:48:01.620
Faculty Office Hours: Great memories and then goes back to the base okay.

466
01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:08.730
Faculty Office Hours: So each each vehicle is.

467
01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:12.750
Faculty Office Hours: going to have at most.

468
01:48:14.730 --> 01:48:16.410
Faculty Office Hours: kegs delivered.

469
01:48:18.210 --> 01:48:24.780
Faculty Office Hours: Regardless of how many times how many how many seconds, it takes to do the deliveries.

470
01:48:25.290 --> 01:48:25.830
Okay.

471
01:48:29.370 --> 01:48:31.980
Faculty Office Hours: And then you know you know, based on.

472
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:35.910
Faculty Office Hours: How efficiently route each.

473
01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:42.480
Faculty Office Hours: Vehicles deliveries, I mean.

474
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:48.360
Shadi Kilani: So, Dr Hoffman if you don't mind me asking a good question you.

475
01:48:48.510 --> 01:49:05.130
Shadi Kilani: Are on this point, Sir, so we don't have to make a complete delivery for each customer right, it could be that they get half of what they need, and then we send another trip trip and bring we don't have to factor in that they need to get a complete delivery every time right.

476
01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:08.550
Faculty Office Hours: I believe that's one of the follow up questions.

477
01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:14.850
Faculty Office Hours: One of the follow up questions is.

478
01:49:17.610 --> 01:49:19.230
Shadi Kilani: Oh yes, yes you're right you're right sorry.

479
01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:21.480
Faculty Office Hours: Does it make sense to.

480
01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:28.080
Faculty Office Hours: Only make complete deliveries or split them up.

481
01:49:30.540 --> 01:49:34.980
Faculty Office Hours: And I think you're gonna have to kind of like figure it out for yourself, I mean.

482
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:42.360
Faculty Office Hours: yeah you can try and modify the model or you can just kind of use common sense about that or it's just.

483
01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:51.150
Shadi Kilani: No, but I mean when you optimize you don't have to at least so probably you put that constraint on the number and then you could see what kind of solution, you get.

484
01:49:51.690 --> 01:49:59.430
Shadi Kilani: And if you look at visually and you could see that you're going to the same node twice that means that you made a partial delivery right.

485
01:50:01.050 --> 01:50:06.150
Shadi Kilani: I mean that's how I would get my mind, giving up too much i'm sorry i'm doing that.

486
01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:20.100
Faculty Office Hours: It kind of depends on how you define the variables to when you say i'll see if I go back twice, I mean if the question is mean.

487
01:50:21.150 --> 01:50:37.770
Faculty Office Hours: Because your constraints might say that you visit each do every note exactly once, in which case you would only go there once so I mean it kind of depends on how you set up the constraints.

488
01:50:40.170 --> 01:50:47.010
Faculty Office Hours: Whether you actually would see that you would go there more than once.

489
01:50:53.850 --> 01:51:00.120
Wright, Beth: And that's controlled by the flow in turn correct is there's this thing, this is no so.

490
01:51:00.570 --> 01:51:02.370
Faculty Office Hours: So so So if you have.

491
01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:08.910
Faculty Office Hours: The flow in and flow out, I mean kind of based on the assumption that you make.

492
01:51:10.740 --> 01:51:15.150
Faculty Office Hours: One delivery for each node.

493
01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:25.890
Faculty Office Hours: Then you go in and out what's right, but if you were to go out more than one time, then that would be different.

494
01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:32.910
Faculty Office Hours: And that that that may or may not, you know um.

495
01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:41.400
Faculty Office Hours: I guess that's part of the question i'm asking you might actually.

496
01:51:43.290 --> 01:51:58.140
Faculty Office Hours: think that maybe it could be an advantage to going to the same customer more than once, but I mean kind of like so it's part of its common sense and part of it is.

497
01:52:02.220 --> 01:52:03.900
Faculty Office Hours: You know, it also.

498
01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:10.650
Faculty Office Hours: To some extent, has to do with the numbers but I mean it's mostly common sense.

499
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:21.150
Faculty Office Hours: me if you're going to go to the same customer more than once and you're going to have to.

500
01:52:24.030 --> 01:52:27.690
Faculty Office Hours: make an additional trip back to the brewery.

501
01:52:29.370 --> 01:52:33.540
Faculty Office Hours: Right and that's got to be justified in some sense if you're in a do that.

502
01:52:38.970 --> 01:52:43.260
Faculty Office Hours: Based on the kind of like common sense notion that.

503
01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:47.700
Faculty Office Hours: If there was no capacity.

504
01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:58.980
Faculty Office Hours: On the Van or the order to be called the vehicle, I mean you would just do one trip right I.

505
01:53:00.210 --> 01:53:02.940
Faculty Office Hours: mean there's no reason to do two trips.

506
01:53:04.890 --> 01:53:08.400
Faculty Office Hours: except for the fact that there is a capacity on the vehicle.

507
01:53:12.210 --> 01:53:19.020
Faculty Office Hours: right because it's always better not to go back to the depot and take that additional time.

508
01:53:20.550 --> 01:53:25.350
Faculty Office Hours: But if you have capacity constraints, then.

509
01:53:26.970 --> 01:53:38.040
Faculty Office Hours: It makes sense to make multiple trips or or my you can kind of interpret them as multiple vehicles right.

510
01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:50.160
Karen Fireman: One point this or if we do extra days on the truck that's outside of this and they're not extra trips back it's just the trips that are in the middle of the mall.

511
01:53:57.660 --> 01:53:58.710
Faculty Office Hours: i'm not quite.

512
01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:02.310
Faculty Office Hours: 100% sure on what the question is asking.

513
01:54:02.670 --> 01:54:05.160
Karen Fireman: Okay, all right i'll work on it thanks yeah.

514
01:54:05.190 --> 01:54:21.090
Faculty Office Hours: I mean, but but I mean the question about whether you need a vehicle for multiple days I mean you know, based on the authorization how long you'll need it at the bare minimum.

515
01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:26.280
Faculty Office Hours: And you know how long it's going to take.

516
01:54:27.300 --> 01:54:28.350
Faculty Office Hours: To do the.

517
01:54:30.090 --> 01:54:31.890
Faculty Office Hours: drop offs and pickups.

518
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:44.760
Faculty Office Hours: So you can kind of ballpark how long the total amount of time would be to see if it could be accomplished within one day or you didn't a second day.

519
01:54:47.490 --> 01:54:47.820
Karen Fireman: Thank you.

520
01:54:51.360 --> 01:54:54.480
Faculty Office Hours: Were give someone in your group from Houston.

521
01:54:58.590 --> 01:54:58.980
Faculty Office Hours: Just make.

522
01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:00.720
Faculty Office Hours: up.

523
01:55:02.850 --> 01:55:04.200
Faculty Office Hours: Make the deliveries, you know.

524
01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:04.740
yeah.

525
01:55:07.110 --> 01:55:07.740
Karen Fireman: yeah thanks.

526
01:55:09.810 --> 01:55:10.170
Karen Fireman: y'all.

527
01:55:11.970 --> 01:55:12.360
Karen Fireman: got it.

528
01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:15.510
Karen Fireman: My friend got it you're all heart.

529
01:55:16.890 --> 01:55:17.370
Jim Clark: That my.

530
01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:18.450
Jim Clark: My first thought when they.

531
01:55:18.510 --> 01:55:30.330
Jim Clark: said, we came up is we're going to have to assume that this is the nominal amount of time it takes whether it's big night or whether it's 12 Min whether it's eight in the morning, or whether it's five in the afternoon.

532
01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:42.360
Jim Clark: Just it's gonna it's going to vary what's the weather is it raining you know it, you know so that that has to be mean time.

533
01:55:43.710 --> 01:55:46.110
Jim Clark: Some day to go faster, some day to go slower.

534
01:55:46.650 --> 01:55:49.170
Faculty Office Hours: So do you mean the transit times are.

535
01:55:49.170 --> 01:55:57.030
Faculty Office Hours: The items to deliver the kegs mean like to take the kegs.

536
01:55:58.290 --> 01:56:01.590
Faculty Office Hours: From the truck and back to.

537
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:04.590
Faculty Office Hours: The empties back to the.

538
01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:18.360
Jim Clark: know, I think that time is is not going to change with with external conditions, but I do, I do think the transit time between the locations that's going to have to be nominal because I think we have enough.

539
01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:34.260
Jim Clark: Information to challenge that to say, it should be more or less, but you might want to make a case of the time and motion studies of getting things on or off the truck at the customer that that's something that I had to think about.

540
01:56:35.190 --> 01:56:36.000
Faculty Office Hours: sure now.

541
01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:55.800
Faculty Office Hours: let's think about that, so the the times in seconds that are in the data set are from some you know arbitrary point you know, like could be 2pm could be could be whatever time they decided to get the data from.

542
01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:02.520
Faculty Office Hours: So I guess you need to kind of think about.

543
01:57:04.650 --> 01:57:08.430
Faculty Office Hours: It and it kind of informs.

544
01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:19.710
Faculty Office Hours: How, you know about what the traffic patterns are in Houston and so forth mean so let's say.

545
01:57:20.910 --> 01:57:30.720
Faculty Office Hours: let's say you have for routing patterns for vehicles so that's it they're not separate vehicles but they're just like trips right.

546
01:57:31.770 --> 01:57:34.650
Faculty Office Hours: doesn't matter what order they do you do live in.

547
01:57:36.210 --> 01:57:38.040
Faculty Office Hours: Or is that.

548
01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:43.410
Faculty Office Hours: Is that like totally dependent on Houston traffic.

549
01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:45.090
Karen Fireman: I.

550
01:57:46.410 --> 01:57:47.970
Karen Fireman: got another question when you're done with that.

551
01:57:49.530 --> 01:57:52.500
Wilson Pineda: Traffic to a matter because that way you're giving us the time.

552
01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:57.840
Faculty Office Hours: i'm giving you the time but.

553
01:57:59.250 --> 01:58:00.390
Karen Fireman: I think we'll send you can.

554
01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:05.190
Karen Fireman: infer it that it may be different at different times a day and that's part of the answer to your question that's probably.

555
01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:16.200
Wilson Pineda: I mean, why would you make that assumption that was the case, we have to treat table for different part of the day, so we just have one table made the assumption that is what it is.

556
01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:18.570
Faculty Office Hours: Well, maybe you would have like.

557
01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:21.660
Faculty Office Hours: hundred tables right.

558
01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:26.700
Wilson Pineda: yeah I understand, but on this particular case is just one, so we use that one.

559
01:58:27.390 --> 01:58:37.290
Karen Fireman: yeah but he's saying, if you expand your mind and there were some more complex thing um can I can I go into one other question sort of on a specific on the code here for a second.

560
01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:38.700
Faculty Office Hours: Sure sure.

561
01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:46.770
Karen Fireman: Okay inside your proc SG plot, which is kind of far down in the code, this was the baggage code that we're converting.

562
01:58:47.190 --> 01:58:47.550
Faculty Office Hours: You know.

563
01:58:47.880 --> 01:59:02.010
Karen Fireman: We put in a label and before, when I say we you did all the work you had label before you had a label of the location on that was all well and good, when we have the baggage data and it had location.

564
01:59:03.690 --> 01:59:15.960
Karen Fireman: It seems like when I put in code in there, it doesn't seem to recognize that, even though I read in stuff using code and i'm a little confused why it's thinking that's not a variable.

565
01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:20.790
Faculty Office Hours: So you are.

566
01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.290
Karen Fireman: I had to do the brackets you.

567
01:59:22.290 --> 01:59:33.120
Karen Fireman: know the square brackets I had code in the square brackets but later when I when I said data label equals just the word code if it was like hey I don't know that I don't know that variable.

568
01:59:37.530 --> 01:59:39.480
Faculty Office Hours: So I mean.

569
01:59:41.100 --> 01:59:44.310
Faculty Office Hours: i'm trying to answer that question so.

570
01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:48.540
Faculty Office Hours: So the graphing.

571
01:59:49.590 --> 01:59:50.010
Faculty Office Hours: code.

572
01:59:51.780 --> 01:59:52.710
Faculty Office Hours: Is it different.

573
01:59:54.390 --> 02:00:02.670
Faculty Office Hours: SAS procedure and it's asking you kind of what to label the nodes right.

574
02:00:03.300 --> 02:00:08.520
Faculty Office Hours: Right and your question is, you have chosen a different.

575
02:00:10.650 --> 02:00:14.640
Faculty Office Hours: Different variable to to to to label and.

576
02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:29.880
Karen Fireman: So wait a minute I think I see Okay, I think I see wait a minute okay you kind of you kind of gave me a hint there alright i'm going to hold for you other people ask your questions, I can have a look, thank you, I think you just kind of answer me thank you sure.

577
02:00:29.970 --> 02:00:33.870
Faculty Office Hours: that's fine I mean so so's House has a lot of.

578
02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:49.020
Faculty Office Hours: There, there are a lot of capabilities that SAS has to produce output, but it's kind of a question of you know how how how.

579
02:00:49.980 --> 02:01:00.060
Faculty Office Hours: How deep or how dark you want to go into it to kind of like get the graphs you want, or do you want to just like go in there and kind of like get something.

580
02:01:00.630 --> 02:01:16.980
Faculty Office Hours: yeah this this works and i'm that's fine so i'm hoping that you just kind of like modify what i've done, I mean you could you could do a whole lot more, but I don't really think that.

581
02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:22.200
Faculty Office Hours: you're gonna achieve a lot of benefit from it, I mean.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:24.720

02:01:48.330 --> 02:01:48.780
So.

587
02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:57.150
Coleman, Clay: It was, it was the one about the gap, and I mean that that made sense, I just want to make sure I wasn't you know barking up the wrong tree or anything.

588
02:01:59.490 --> 02:02:12.090
Jim Clark: Okay, I would say that I follow the same category of trying to be more of a list or a questionnaire, but this people are asking great questions and learning just by listening and so.

589
02:02:13.230 --> 02:02:14.340
Faculty Office Hours: yeah me too.

Faculty Office Hours: Just like.

611
02:03:55.800 --> 02:04:01.500

612
02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:15.570
Faculty Office Hours: Apart from using prakash model, just like you know it's okay i'm going to do it this way i'm going to go here under here on here and just calculate the number of seconds, so I mean it's not like.

613
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:21.510
Faculty Office Hours: You know, you could come up with a solution.

614
02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:45.630
Faculty Office Hours: A reasonable solution mean I mean just just pretend you're like the guy driving the truck and say you know here, you know deliver these tags and he comes up with some solution that's like okay i'll do it based on you know right to left or you know, whatever and and and come up with.

615
02:04:46.740 --> 02:05:01.440
Faculty Office Hours: Something and that gives you a basis for comparison, so I mean if you're wondering whether you're whether you're a solution is reasonable or not in terms of the number of seconds just think of like doing it.

616
02:05:04.050 --> 02:05:12.510
Faculty Office Hours: Some other way somebody we hiding how to you know how to how to route them and just go by that.
