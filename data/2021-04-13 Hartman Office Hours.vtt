1
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.890
Faculty Office Hours: Sorry, I kind of lost track of time.

2
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.870
Faculty Office Hours: But i'm here now.

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.759
Faculty Office Hours: What it's worth.

4
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.150
Jim Clark: working.

5
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.660
Jim Clark: Noise in.

6
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.640
Jim Clark: My house catch.

7
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.100
Jim Clark: My phone off for a second.

8
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.480
Okay.

9
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.900
Jim Clark: I was going to try to ask you a question about.

10
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.820
Jim Clark: number five.

11
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.490
Jim Clark: i'm not sure how to how to ask in such a way that.

12
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.690
Jim Clark: You directly, whether or not.

13
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.060
Wright, Beth: Jim I actually have the same question, so I wonder if the idea is not enough with.

14
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.120
Karen Fireman: me too, I was wondering if I had it right, I think I do, but I could have a completely backwards.

15
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.460
Faculty Office Hours: Also does one of you want to share.

16
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.290
Wright, Beth: yeah I got it.

17
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.070
Okay.

18
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:10.350
Wright, Beth: Okay, so adding the change to the code phrase is relatively simple, we want to make sure we're using the right algorithm but, and then we want to expand the inventory balance to see what feeds into that.

19
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.560
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I would say just before you go any further.

20
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.490
Wright, Beth: mm hmm.

21
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.800
Faculty Office Hours: It shouldn't be necessary to turn the pre solver off.

22
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.260
Wright, Beth: Okay.

23
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:34.260
Faculty Office Hours: So that turning the pre solver off is something we do and we use the warm start option Okay, but it's not necessary for just using the network simplex.

24
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:47.670
Faculty Office Hours: Okay it's not it's not a bad thing, but sometimes the pre solver can make some simplifications and then the network simplex can follow up on that, but yeah.

25
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.200
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so it.

26
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:59.250
Wright, Beth: really changed whether something can be solved in that pure or not, or would that cause us to change.

27
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.470
Faculty Office Hours: The will, there are some kind of weird things that the pre solver does.

28
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:16.710
Faculty Office Hours: I would say that this is the more straightforward way to do it is to not involve the pre solver, but you can experiment with it, if you want just to try it with and without and see what happens.

29
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.540
Karen Fireman: See you just turn that.

30
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.630
Karen Fireman: awesome it just would take that part out the priest or nun that you just take that whole line out that point yeah.

31
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:32.010
Faculty Office Hours: So they're there they're completely separate options, but they may interact with each other okay so there's your.

32
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.940
Wright, Beth: mm hmm yep.

33
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:55.350
Wright, Beth: So yep, so this is what we're looking at to determine what's coming in and out of that node So when I looked at it, I rearranged the equation, so we could see what was on what side, so these three pieces are going into it right.

34
00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:03.180
Wright, Beth: And number produced and priests inventory previous period, and then.

35
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.350
Wright, Beth: You know that.

36
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.420
Faculty Office Hours: It should make sense and and kind of inventory sense.

37
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.650
Wright, Beth: mm hmm.

38
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.040
Wright, Beth: Okay hey yeah which yeah because you have.

39
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:29.460
Wright, Beth: Well, you have all this extra stuff that you need the stuff that you made this period and stuff you're carrying over from last grade yeah it does make sense, and then the reason that you would pick so I picked demand is the parameter.

40
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:41.580
Wright, Beth: To because it this coefficient match the fourth period demand in that print statement.

41
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.320
Faculty Office Hours: Okay let's do that, so what.

42
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:44.640
I would say that.

43
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:53.250
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, but what I would add to that is that demand is a parameter array.

44
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.870
Wright, Beth: Okay.

45
00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:06.240
Faculty Office Hours: And if i'm asking for the value of an individual parameter then demand is not quite the full picture so let's look at some of the other inputs or outputs.

46
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.380
Karen Fireman: wouldn't it be demand left bracket for right before me refresh.

47
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.340
Faculty Office Hours: That would be the parameter so so.

48
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.780
Faculty Office Hours: Individual.

49
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:25.710
Faculty Office Hours: component of a parameter array is itself a parameter and that's more what i'm looking for here, and you can see that that as it relates to the inputs, that you have.

50
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:35.820
Faculty Office Hours: The same thing that that num prod and i'm in br also arrays but you've selected a particular time period.

51
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.040
Karen Fireman: Right.

52
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.120
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, does that does that answer your question.

53
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:49.980
Wright, Beth: yeah I think so, as long as it's not i'm not but, so why i'm the one link that i'm not making as well as.

54
00:06:51.480 --> 00:07:00.360
Wright, Beth: Like how demand comes out of that maybe it's because i'm trying to think of it to literally in terms of like demand is because demands not production.

55
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.530
Wright, Beth: Right is that separate piece so i'm.

56
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.840
Faculty Office Hours: Well, so I guess.

57
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.310
Faculty Office Hours: Looking at the following way.

58
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:19.770
Faculty Office Hours: In terms of inputs and outputs so you you, you make things and those things go into inventory and then you have a carry over from previous period.

59
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.580
Faculty Office Hours: And what goes out.

60
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:32.760
Faculty Office Hours: You know, think of it as kind of physically like going into a storage locker and then being taken out, so what comes out is.

61
00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:34.200
Wright, Beth: That.

62
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.960
Faculty Office Hours: What is necessary to satisfy demand.

63
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:45.750
Faculty Office Hours: And then, whatever is left is carried over into inventory for the subsequent month the complicating factor here is that.

64
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:58.020
Faculty Office Hours: If we don't have enough to satisfy demand then we're having to pull from somewhere else you can think of that unmet demand is coming from a separate source, if you want.

65
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.600
Faculty Office Hours: or it could just be that.

66
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:08.820
Faculty Office Hours: That we have to pay for Jim beam to get that supply from somewhere else.

67
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:20.160
Karen Fireman: Can you put the numbers underneath these each one of like where you have the nominee for right now i'm in for is just like for edification but also.

68
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:20.940
Faculty Office Hours: Say yeah you.

69
00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.160
Faculty Office Hours: Put the numbers underneath if that helps you.

70
00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:24.510
Karen Fireman: It does mean.

71
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.990
Faculty Office Hours: That it's it's an equivalence right.

72
00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.610
Karen Fireman: yeah but.

73
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:37.320
Faculty Office Hours: So the constraint says that, regardless of what the values are they have to be the, it has to equate.

74
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:44.670
Faculty Office Hours: and putting this specific values in for the solution says that in the solution they're also the same.

75
00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:58.650
Karen Fireman: It seemed to me that the one that little thing that they put up there when you did when you did the expand where they had constrained inventory balance for colon mind numbing of for.

76
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:12.630
Karen Fireman: US and met demand of four plus nonprofit four plus nothing equals 2600 that to me told me where to put everything because of the pluses and minuses.

77
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:23.400
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so so it's just a question of the way we think of the constraint usually everything is positive, so it kind of tells you to shift things from one side to the other.

78
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:38.520
Faculty Office Hours: But when the solver is ready to solve the model it just it doesn't need any intuition, it just does the math that puts all the variable terms on one side and all the numeric terms, on the other, so that's what you see when you say expand.

79
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:49.710
Faculty Office Hours: In the same way that when you are winning class we expanded the the overtime.

80
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.250
Faculty Office Hours: constraints, instead of adding overtime, to the right it's attracted it from the Left.

81
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:57.990
Faculty Office Hours: So it's.

82
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:06.030
Faculty Office Hours: It would be nice if it displayed it in exactly the same way that you declared it but.

83
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:10.680
Faculty Office Hours: that's what the compiler people decided is the appropriate thing to display.

84
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.570
Karen Fireman: yeah.

85
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.650
Karen Fireman: So we're just supposed to write them in into your picture right and give you the.

86
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.110
Faculty Office Hours: Right okay cool.

87
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:23.790
Jim Clark: It will.

88
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.130
Jim Clark: Let me share mine I think there's.

89
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.350
Jim Clark: Something like.

90
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:30.180
Jim Clark: This.

91
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.950
Jim Clark: yeah something to that sort of idea.

92
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.170
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so so you can.

93
00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:05.490
Faculty Office Hours: I don't know if the the flow in is kind of extraneous it helps you understand so So those are both part of flow in.

94
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:20.640
Faculty Office Hours: But it's not necessary to include that in the labeling and then like like her first diagram you want to you want to amend the demand to a specific.

95
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.650
Faculty Office Hours: time period.

96
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:41.940
Jim Clark: Now, now that now that i've seen that she doesn't think maybe that's what I should do, but I was just trying to categorize instead of a generic number, something that was related to what was the code so i'll often do some more and make a decision okay.

97
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.170
Faculty Office Hours: yeah The other thing you can do instead of putting flow in and and flow out is just kind of put a put a line.

98
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:56.400
Faculty Office Hours: Put a line through the node that kind of divides the inputs and the outputs.

99
00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:05.190
Faculty Office Hours: That kind of accomplishes the same thing just tells which are the flows in and flows out so like you're you're lying would kind of go.

100
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:21.570
Faculty Office Hours: Under the blue line and to the left of the red line if that makes sense, just to to to put a kind of like a delineation between the arcs that go in and the arcs that go out.

101
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:25.470
Jim Clark: and be more generic Thank you.

102
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.030
Jim Clark: Sorry.

103
00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:28.950
Jim Clark: All right, thank you.

104
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:42.360
Faculty Office Hours: Sure, and in the solution i'll put a kind of a generic diagram that that illustrates all of the time periods, but i'm only asking you to to look at this specific one.

105
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.820
Karen Fireman: I can show you mine sure okay okay.

106
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:50.520
Karen Fireman: Your screen.

107
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.330
Karen Fireman: So that was my drawing here can you see.

108
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.040
Faculty Office Hours: I can see it.

109
00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:05.550
Karen Fireman: I took it from up here, but it got cut off when I I just do it by hand, so I just read this little note from what you just said just now down here, but this is what I had I had zero.

110
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.590
Faculty Office Hours: Right now, what you have is fine and.

111
00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:14.970
Faculty Office Hours: The The numbers are are not necessary, because, like I said it's.

112
00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.730
Karen Fireman: I knew I just like to be in there.

113
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:19.110
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

114
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:21.450
Karen Fireman: that's why I was wanting to know if it was okay okay.

115
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.470
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I mean if it helps like making sure that things kind of add up to the right.

116
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:34.950
Karen Fireman: it's exactly right like I had her here and I was like wait a minute this doesn't add up add all these guys so dragged on wait a minute i'm off yeah and I pulled I pulled the wrong number.

117
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:35.700
Faculty Office Hours: should be fine.

118
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.550
Karen Fireman: Okay cool i'll do you want this thing up here too I mean we can I can copy it, it was there I just.

119
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.800
Faculty Office Hours: mean in terms of the in the.

120
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.540
Karen Fireman: summary, I mean.

121
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.080
Karen Fireman: that's very.

122
00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.460
Faculty Office Hours: helpful because.

123
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.770
Faculty Office Hours: Otherwise I wouldn't have to go into your program to see that you expanded it.

124
00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:54.210
Karen Fireman: No worries you'll have it.

125
00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:55.650
Karen Fireman: Okay, thank you.

126
00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.540
Faculty Office Hours: i'll stop.

127
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:10.350
Jim Clark: Now basis of my question, so I think i'm good.

128
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:12.570
Karen Fireman: me too.

129
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:16.560
Karen Fireman: Okay, I think i'm gonna drop off if that's okay yeah.

130
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.350
Faculty Office Hours: we'll miss you but it's okay.

131
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:21.420
Karen Fireman: i'll miss you so.

132
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:23.070
Jim Clark: we'll.

133
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.090
Karen Fireman: See you.

134
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:25.440
Jim Clark: On Thursday.

135
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:31.410
Karen Fireman: yeah let's do Thursday I guess they're taking a stealing half an hour Maybe you can Maybe you can be like a pilot make it up.

136
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:35.550
Faculty Office Hours: I think I would be risky.

137
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.970
Karen Fireman: Thank you, Dr harmon take care okay bye bye.

138
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.160
Christian Gover: I had a question.

139
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:48.930
Faculty Office Hours: Okay.

140
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.860
Faculty Office Hours: Is this Christian.

141
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:51.330
Christian Gover: Yes, this is me.

142
00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:52.080
Faculty Office Hours: Christian.

143
00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.160
Faculty Office Hours: what's what's your question.

144
00:14:54.270 --> 00:15:09.720
Christian Gover: On question three I wasn't sure if I was doing on correctly, it seemed pretty complicated um I don't know if there's a more elegant way to do it, but I don't know if I should share my code with you.

145
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:11.730
Faculty Office Hours: Well, so, so this is the.

146
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.360
Christian Gover: overtime question right yeah the 30 point question, yes.

147
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.110
Faculty Office Hours: Right, and so this this is going to mimic the.

148
00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:22.980
Faculty Office Hours: The demonstration that we did in class.

149
00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:37.590
Faculty Office Hours: So is as as elegant or inelegant as the version we did in class was you can expect years to be roughly the same with just different numbers and different data sets.

150
00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.520
Christian Gover: All right, okay I love that Thank you.

151
00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.780
Faculty Office Hours: Okay sure.

152
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:44.550
um.

153
00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.480
Monica A. Harwig: Dr hartman is Monica.

154
00:15:48.840 --> 00:16:02.370
Monica A. Harwig: Monica hi Okay, so this is, I mean I understand all the homework in five was my question, so I understand that now, so this is not regards to the hummers just an idea I had, and I wanted to get your opinion on it.

155
00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:13.170
Monica A. Harwig: Okay okay so it's all kind of optimization because Okay, so I see in the McDonalds you know what we're doing for that, which I think is I like that and I thought.

156
00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:23.430
Monica A. Harwig: Okay, so do you know I want to do the same thing, but for just for calories and nutritional information in general for foods.

157
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:35.400
Monica A. Harwig: Because, for my own personal use, because I was using you know i'm you know count calories if i'm good i'm smart and I was using this service noon, but it costs 50 bucks a month.

158
00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:43.350
Monica A. Harwig: And it's good, but you got to put all your I mean you're putting all your data, like everything I eat everything every.

159
00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:50.250
Monica A. Harwig: way goes into their little database and I don't like that I don't feel comfortable with it so um.

160
00:16:50.940 --> 00:17:00.390
Monica A. Harwig: And I was wondering, I know I was thinking, well, I can do my own calorie counter optimization kind of like you do at the McDonalds that my question is.

161
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:17.160
Monica A. Harwig: I look for data I don't want to obviously redo the table, and I know there's a lot of calorie tables out there they're they're available, but do you know, a place where you can go where you feel safe getting a table like that you know it's already been done.

162
00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:23.250
Faculty Office Hours: I don't I don't know that I know that a lot of like you say.

163
00:17:24.570 --> 00:17:27.060
Faculty Office Hours: programs have.

164
00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:33.540
Faculty Office Hours: Databases like that, and some of them are more complete than others.

165
00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.560
Faculty Office Hours: I might I might ask my wife.

166
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.970
Faculty Office Hours: Kathy do you know if there any like.

167
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:51.810
Faculty Office Hours: Are there any like databases that you can use it obviously that you can look up your calorie.

168
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:55.050
Faculty Office Hours: and

169
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:05.340
Faculty Office Hours: Then the APP store, so my wife is saying that there's a there's an APP called chronometer.

170
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:13.890
Faculty Office Hours: that's available in the APP store that's free I don't know that I guess that would be kind of a question of whether or not the.

171
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.820
Faculty Office Hours: What they do with your your private information but.

172
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:19.800
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

173
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.530
Monica A. Harwig: What I wanted to do was use it.

174
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:31.140
Monica A. Harwig: Also for my professional development, you know as far as getting a table and opt trying, you know, trying to optimize it kind of like we're doing in class.

175
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:39.180
Faculty Office Hours: So, in terms of getting a big table I I don't know about that, I think that a lot of these services are built kind of like on queries.

176
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:52.050
Faculty Office Hours: So you could you could say okay like like you're doing now, you could say, well, this is what I ate and they will give you the information for it, but I don't know that you're going to.

177
00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:01.350
Faculty Office Hours: I don't know if you're going to be able to find some place that will let you download a huge file.

178
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:10.620
Faculty Office Hours: But you could kind of build that up over time, so if you use an APP that's more anonymous than the new.

179
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:12.450
Faculty Office Hours: Then.

180
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:20.550
Faculty Office Hours: You know, every time you add something in you can take their data and add it to your table.

181
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:27.210
Faculty Office Hours: mm hmm i'm just not sure kind of what what format, they may provide the data to you.

182
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.980
Faculty Office Hours: Whether it's going to be easy or hard to add it to the table.

183
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:34.140
Monica A. Harwig: Okay.

184
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:45.060
Monica A. Harwig: Well i'll just do some more research on some searching on it, I see I see what I can find on it and.

185
00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.340
Monica A. Harwig: So I thought that mcdonald's was good, I was like well I don't really eat at mcdonald's.

186
00:19:51.780 --> 00:20:00.660
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so but I mean in terms of the the optimization model, how you could see that helping you would be maybe something like.

187
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.110
Faculty Office Hours: You know, eating a couple of meals.

188
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.820
Faculty Office Hours: And you want to figure out Okay, what can I eat for dinner that's going to.

189

Faculty Office Hours: You know satisfy my macros.

190
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.230

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:17.100
Monica A. Harwig: mm hmm.

192
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.280
Faculty Office Hours: And then, like make suggestions to you, but but.

193
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:24.630
Faculty Office Hours: it's possible that there's also you know Apps that will do that same thing.

194
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:27.840
Faculty Office Hours: Right tell you, based on what you've already done.

195
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.610
Faculty Office Hours: And i'm not sure if.

196
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:34.980
