00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.690
Jones, Edward R: You know I can put sunglasses on and all it just a hat on and it'll still recognize me with the mask on now.

3
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.929
Jones, Edward R: you'd think they would have figured that out right.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.430
Jones, Edward R: Well that's right if I can't I have to do this thing differently now.

5
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.710
Jones, Edward R: There it is OK.

6
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.480
Jones, Edward R: OK interrupt pass code.

7
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.610
Jones, Edward R: All right.

8
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.090
Jones, Edward R: Okay, good good all right great so.

9
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.580
Jones, Edward R: Am I sharing your screen can everybody see that.

10
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.220
Jones, Edward R: No.

11
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.740
Jim Clark: Yes, we can see you, but not that's.

12
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.010
Jones, Edward R: Not the screen Okay, I need to share the screen then let's.

13
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.490
Jones, Edward R: Wear.

14
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.420
Jones, Edward R: Like a teeny weeny monitor Okay, where is it.

15
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.780
Jones, Edward R: I think it's here, I have to make this larger something there you go and then I have to go share screen.

16
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.850
Jones, Edward R: and

17
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.080
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

18
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.300
Jones, Edward R: This can you see Okay, you can see it good.

19
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:49.500
Jones, Edward R: All right, so if you go down to the the direction the link it's the links on the left hand side you'll see wi fi refinances freeze there there's nothing there okay I don't know about you, but it was yeah I lost a lot of time on week five.

20
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.990
Jones, Edward R: We had power up and down 30 minutes on 30 minutes off me and the good news is we didn't get cold The bad news is.

21
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.560
Jones, Edward R: I think you'd be right in the middle of doing some programming or something on the computer and the computer and stop break.

22
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:15.870
Jones, Edward R: Fortunately, the computer did not break on man, thank God, for that, but so I got kind of used to watching the clock and saving stuff but it got.

23
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:25.380
Jones, Edward R: It got it didn't get enough done as I wanted, and then, as he dragged on and on, I found out there were people much worse off than me.

24
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:37.320
Jones, Edward R: Some students who had no power at all some students who were traveling and then trying to get back and then I got back and their house is all messed up and everything so and then.

25
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:48.270
Jones, Edward R: You know, of course, everybody's wearing a mask and trying to not get sick so last week was I figure well let's just go ahead and move on.

26
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:57.600
Jones, Edward R: Hopefully, everybody is going to recover Houston is really good at this it's like I was thinking about this and I don't know whether you live in Houston you know what hurricanes like.

27
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:07.320
Jones, Edward R: i'm thinking this may have been worse than hurricane because i'll tell you what, why did why I think so because you didn't see it coming.

28
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:19.080
Jones, Edward R: If no warning is like well here with the hurricane it's like okay three or four day warning okay get to get gas in the car get some something to stay warm or cool.

29
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:28.560
Jones, Edward R: Do we live, do we stay or do we leave us about food, you know you have time to think about it and you mentally prepared for it, this was like you woke up the first time I knew about it was.

30
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:41.550
Jones, Edward R: Three o'clock in the morning on Monday, no power power went off So the first thing you think about is the power line blue down again and it'll be on 30 minutes and Sure enough, it was on 30 minutes, so I think we're going to go.

31
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:53.010
Jones, Edward R: 30 minutes, so I was getting a copy ready and everything you know thinking okay well i'll go get the class ready and and come to work on come here on Tuesday.

32
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.500
Jones, Edward R: And then it's like off again and I don't know this is gonna be difficult getting ready for class.

33
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:10.710
Jones, Edward R: And then up and down and down again and up and up and then my wife says she starts screaming in the kitchen no water now she is she my wife is add okay.

34
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:22.980
Jones, Edward R: And she has to everything in the right place the the everything has to be clean and put away so this idea of having dirty dishes in the sink was very foreign for her.

35
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:34.050
Jones, Edward R: And she was like, no, no, so I don't know what was worse, the cold or listen to my screen, so I told her I said i'm leaving if you if you can't stop that screaming.

36
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:45.540
Jones, Edward R: I can handle the kill, but not the screaming so it was it was a rough deal, and I think in some respects, it was worse than a hurricane in the good news is, at least for most people.

37
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:57.300
Jones, Edward R: it's been a temporary experience i'm sure there's some of you up there out there that have not found that to be the case and i'm sorry I really, really.

38
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.650
Jones, Edward R: You know the little bit of an inconvenience that I had was nothing compared to what some people are going through so.

39
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:24.030
Jones, Edward R: But hopefully we'll all recover on this and get moving forward and and I tell you I hear more and more people every day in the vaccine and in I see the numbers going down, which is good, you know, like that was good so anyway, I see, we have a baby in the audience oh.

40
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.460
Jones, Edward R: Who is this.

41
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.980
Jones, Edward R: Oh Hello.

42
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:42.240
Jones, Edward R: I don't see him name next year you're beautiful picture beautiful kid okay all right so tonight what we're going to do is we're going to talk a little bit about.

43
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:52.170
Jones, Edward R: The week for assignment and and then we'll move on to talking about natural language processing using Google.

44
00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:01.920
Jones, Edward R: And then hopefully we'll move on to talking about drones and what we're going to be doing with that that's going to be an ongoing thing for the next few classes.

45
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:13.830
Jones, Edward R: So, if you would go to let's see if we go to week number four and you open that up and if you go to the week for assignment let's see it should show.

46
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:23.160
Jones, Edward R: The actual solution here at the bottom H O w for communicate P, why.

47
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.050
Jones, Edward R: So.

48
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.240
Jones, Edward R: Let me see if I can.

49
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.940
Jones, Edward R: Get anaconda working on my computer here.

50
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.620
Jones, Edward R: yeah.

51
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.010
Jones, Edward R: Coming up.

52
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.730
Jones, Edward R: So Leah that's your baby.

53
00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.390
Leiah Wyckoff: yeah she's about four years old and she's.

54
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:11.850
Leiah Wyckoff: Like.

55
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.570
Jones, Edward R: No tissue tissue loose powered during the last week or.

56
00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.980
Leiah Wyckoff: I did.

57
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:26.670
Leiah Wyckoff: But I took every opportunity that we did basically every time I would feed her I would put another bottle on the warm or, just in case the power was out.

58
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.190
Leiah Wyckoff: That hungry so.

59
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.110
Jones, Edward R: Okay, though.

60
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.670
Leiah Wyckoff: yeah she was okay.

61
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.730
Leiah Wyckoff: She started eating baby food, last week, also so that was help.

62
00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.570
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so.

63
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:51.840
Jones, Edward R: With that account is still there Okay, and I need to go off of the base environment and go to the Google environment.

64
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:57.990
Jones, Edward R: And so I have two different environments, one for Google and one for drone.

65
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:10.230
Jones, Edward R: And I guess you could combine though you could do put both of them together, but I haven't bothered to do that sink is probably safer to just keep them separate.

66
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:15.480
Jones, Edward R: OK.

67
00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.470
Jones, Edward R: And i'm going to start up Hello.

68
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.170
Jones, Edward R: spider.

69
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:49.800
Jones, Edward R: So you're talking about the campus you have you have this solution, which is what I would expect Forum, the typical submission and then I have another one which is you'll see it in the week six folder.

70
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.620
Jones, Edward R: and

71
00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:01.830
Jones, Edward R: i'm going to just go ahead and start yet up i'm, so this is where are we okay we'll see what.

72
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.620

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.070
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

74
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:19.590
Jones, Edward R: And I keep getting these advertisements for new versions of this and that i'm going to i'm going to minimize this for right now.

75
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.380
Jones, Edward R: and cancel that and i'm gonna go to week six now.

76
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:29.160
Jones, Edward R: and

77
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.860
Jones, Edward R: there's nothing in week five.

78
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:44.550
Jones, Edward R: In the first file at the top of week six is the improved hw four solution so i'm going to actually download that and start Daddy in in spider.

79
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.640
Jones, Edward R: see where it's going.

80
00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.500
hey.

81
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.770
Jones, Edward R: let's see how do I minimize oh there it is yeah.

82
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.590
Jones, Edward R: Okay i'm trying to maximize or.

83
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:21.780
Jones, Edward R: minimize the.

84
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:27.360
Jones, Edward R: Video here can hide whatever um.

85
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.700
Jones, Edward R: How do I do that.

86
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.500
Jones, Edward R: So I give you more more of the you can see more of the screen.

87
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.380
Jones, Edward R: Right now, I can't even find thanks.

88
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:46.830
Jones, Edward R: So.

89
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.130
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

Jones, Edward R: How do I get rid of the zoom.

91
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:09.150
Jones, Edward R: that's that's my problem let's see if I if I type on zoom and i'm already joined down, so I don't have to do that.

92
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.830
Jones, Edward R: I don't want to leave the meeting, so I want to.

93
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:20.850
Jones, Edward R: hide the video panel there we go all right, thank God.

94
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:28.380
Jones, Edward R: Because i'm trying to give you the I got a small screen here and i'm trying to maximize what i'm what i'm going to be showing here.

95
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.110
Jones, Edward R: So i'm let me look at.

96
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.670
Jones, Edward R: The folder that I usually keep all of this and.

97
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.360
Jones, Edward R: I just downloaded hw for.

98
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.460
Jones, Edward R: The improved version.

99
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:43.650
Jones, Edward R: and

100
00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:46.170
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

101
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:48.840
Jones, Edward R: looks like i'll have to.

102
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:51.990
Jones, Edward R: bring it over.

103
00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:00.150
Jones, Edward R: There it is hw four with mods and i'm going to bring it over into.

104
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.830
Jones, Edward R: Week five trains you.

105
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.360
Jones, Edward R: Okay it's there alright, so now go to spider.

106
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.540
Jones, Edward R: and open that up.

107
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.230
Jones, Edward R: Your dish.

108
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:42.210
Jones, Edward R: So i'm hoping I hope you're following along with me doing the same thing, opening up hw four with mods.

109
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.090
Jones, Edward R: Okay, and.

110
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.450
Fireman, Karen: i'm sorry I don't see that, where do we do that.

111
00:12:52.500 --> 00:13:05.310
Jones, Edward R: you'll find inside of the week six folder at the very top, the first file in week six you'll find it says hw four communicate.

112
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:11.580
Jones, Edward R: And i'm going to try to make the code here on the screen a little larger.

113
00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:17.310
Jones, Edward R: So you can hopefully see and see what i'm doing a little better.

114
00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:22.830
Fireman, Karen: And we are going to okay hw for communicate yes.

115
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.540
Jones, Edward R: And Karen I can't really make out what you're saying.

116
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:30.840
Jones, Edward R: it's kind of muted.

117
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.930
Fireman, Karen: Myself Okay, thank you.

118
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.190
Jones, Edward R: yeah so.

119
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:42.120
Jones, Edward R: All right, so this is this is hw four and if I run it.

120
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.810
Jones, Edward R: See, why is it that I can't minimize the screen over here.

121
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:51.330
Jones, Edward R: Oh there it is.

122
00:13:53.850 --> 00:14:02.520
Jones, Edward R: There we go okay that's better, so let me run this and it should should show there it is alright.

123
00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:14.790
Jones, Edward R: So this is the, this is the version that I put up produced it's it's a little bit more or a little different what's different is, I have a option here to change the source.

124
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:25.920
Jones, Edward R: From English to Spanish and other words by I didn't expect you to do this, I expected all you do and have the by default, you could say how are you today.

125
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:43.530
Jones, Edward R: Something like that, and maybe you want to produce that in English and then, if you click speak loops error both is the target language and source language, so the same so maybe we'll we'll do is change it to Spanish here and see what it says.

126
00:14:45.300 --> 00:15:00.930
Jones, Edward R: say so that's you should show the texts here and hear it on the microphones if if the could they if they language is supported by Google so not all these languages, for example.

127
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:13.890
Jones, Edward R: Zulu is not that they don't have a text to speech translator you can translate this into sulu so, for example, if I change that to zillow and hit speak.

128
00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:29.700
Jones, Edward R: You get the translation, but how do you pronounce that not sure, and there is the Google speech to text, I mean text to speech translator is limited to about 10 languages.

129
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:41.340
Jones, Edward R: Some of them kind of common you know, Spanish and German So if I go to Italian, for example, and say translate.

130
00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:47.280
Jones, Edward R: So that was the Italy Italian version of how are you today.

131
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.670
Jones, Edward R: German became a seaman yeah.

132
00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:55.830
Jones, Edward R: So if I hit that, by the way.

133
00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:58.080
Jones, Edward R: it's kind of interesting.

134
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:12.330
Jones, Edward R: yeah that's that's the formal version of how are you today that's if you were speaking to somebody at work or a little bit older than you or something like that became a seaman on the street you just say Bill Gates.

135
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:24.720
Jones, Edward R: that's a familiar form, and of course in Spanish, you have the same sort of structure, we have two different versions and familiar and the formal.

136
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:43.740
Jones, Edward R: So that is the familiar form in Spanish, the status so come with us, and if you need se como style said if you're using the formal version in Spanish so it's interesting, the French go, I mean the Spanish it's like informal and then in German it's funnel so.

137
00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:50.580
Jones, Edward R: that's kind of cute but at any rate, if you have any issues with this.

138
00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:55.470
Jones, Edward R: homework, please bring them up at the our Q amp a.

139
00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.320
Jones, Edward R: or send me an email.

140
00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:11.310
Jones, Edward R: Now, the first thing you might want to do is just take a look at the code here for this this example and if there's something you to understand, about the solution the code, let me know and we'll work on that.

141
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:13.440
Jones, Edward R: Now.

142
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:22.620
Jones, Edward R: i'm going to tell you this Watson i'll tell you tell you it again before we leave tonight, there is no class next Tuesday, why not.

143
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:36.750
Jones, Edward R: Next Tuesday used to Texas Independence Day and the governor the governor and or whoever's in charge of here has declared this a State holiday for all government workers so that means all universities and.

144
00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:53.730
Jones, Edward R: State supported you know facilities are going to be closed next Tuesday just for one day, so in those in that on this is the free I didn't even know, we had a Texas Independence Day, did you know Jamie okay I should know that sort of.

145
00:17:55.890 --> 00:18:05.610
Jones, Edward R: yeah so it's March, the second and I don't know what that corresponds to reset the is that the the.

146
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.200
Jones, Edward R: Treaty of not know which treaty, but whatever we'll look it up.

147
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.360
Fireman, Karen: Maybe San jacinto.

148
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:14.100
Jones, Edward R: yeah it could be.

149
00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:19.320
Jones, Edward R: San jacinto or picabo the hill logo I don't know.

150
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.010
Fireman, Karen: Though that.

151
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:24.060
Jim Clark: April 21 is the anniversary of that balance changer Sarah.

152
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.430
Jones, Edward R: Okay, and you said oh okay.

153
00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:33.240
Fireman, Karen: You transpose this supposed to run when we click f5 because my just hung there.

154
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:34.740
Jones, Edward R: You mean the homework for.

155
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:36.660
Fireman, Karen: yeah.

156
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.650
Fireman, Karen: Oh there it is.

157
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:39.930
Fireman, Karen: it's in again i'm sorry Thank you got it.

158
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:45.270
Jones, Edward R: Okay yeah of course it's you can see the on the import statements, you have to have.

159
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:48.660
Jones, Edward R: The Google cloud material.

160
00:18:49.080 --> 00:19:05.460
Jones, Edward R: installed in your environment, and you can see what they are here on my screen if you in and, of course, you would got you would have gotten the message about hey it's doesn't don't recognize that particular important, but if you got to pass that it should run.

161
00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:21.090
Jones, Edward R: OK now Another thing I want to point out we're getting ready to switch gears here pretty soon well i'll talk about this later in some detail, but I wanted to mention that, up until now nearly I think.

162
00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:34.500
Jones, Edward R: All of the widgets that we've been using have been the tinker widgets that's the TT K widget there's a whole nother family that that actually.

163
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:48.450
Jones, Edward R: They use when they developed tinker they actually derived the button for tinker from the tk version of button so there's a whole family of widgets call the tk but.

164
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:59.730
Jones, Edward R: widgets that you can use and, in fact, you can have you can use both of them, so you could have one button in your ui using the TT K version.

165
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:08.070
Jones, Edward R: And then another one, using the tk version now why would you want to do that, while you're going to see you're going to see another good week today.

166
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:21.780
Jones, Edward R: Where I did that I ended up I have learned to make something really kind of fancy looking at here and so with the tk version, you can control things like put an image in your button.

167
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:36.660
Jones, Edward R: or change the height, you can change the height around it tk but but a tk button, you can so you have more options in the tk environment for modifying the widget than you do in the TT K.

168
00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:46.620
Jones, Edward R: So what is this about the people who created the tck version of the widget this so thinking let's make it easy let's make it easy to use, something subtle.

169
00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:55.260
Jones, Edward R: If you look at the tk version you've got like 20 or 30 options and they said now let's just put it down to like 10 or so.

170
00:20:55.740 --> 00:21:04.290
Jones, Edward R: The major ones that we use and for the rest of them out okay well that's fine if you're just going to put something together and it's a simple sort of thing.

171
00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:08.280
Jones, Edward R: Like a pop up you know you want to pop up in your program that comes up and says.

172
00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:19.680
Jones, Edward R: warning warning you know the sky is falling, or something like that you, you don't need something really integrating in and really complicated, so you can make a little widget that pops up for that.

173
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:25.560
Jones, Edward R: And you could use a tinker widgets for that and it'll it should it will work fine.

174
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:34.620
Jones, Edward R: But if you're making a nap that you're going to use and you're going to present to other people to use maybe you want something a little more fans little fancy.

175
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:47.160
Jones, Edward R: You might want to put an icon or your logo in part of the part of the fixture and doing that and tinker you can do it is not as elegant as doing that in tk.

176
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:57.390
Jones, Edward R: So, so now you're going to see some tk widgets that I used and you'll see the sort of thing, and you also have assignments as week six assignment.

177
00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:07.410
Jones, Edward R: You have two weeks to do that assignments okay and i'm probably going to add a little bit more to the assignment this assignment is.

178
00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:27.240
Jones, Edward R: Basically, if you look at the week six assignment you'll see it, it says, take the homework solution for week three and modified a little bit, and so I don't think it's all that challenging but it is, it will require you to use some of the things that we're going to talk about tonight.

179
00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:42.510
Jones, Edward R: So let me go ahead and shut that down and now we're going to talk to start there this tonight is going to be devoted divided into two different areas, the first area we're going to talk about natural language.

180
00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:45.180
Jones, Edward R: programming.

181
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:48.270
Jones, Edward R: And nlp in PO.

182
00:22:50.280 --> 00:23:02.220
Jones, Edward R: nlp excuse me natural language processing or programming and we're going to talk about in sentiment analysis now, this goes back to this last summer.

183
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:15.360
Jones, Edward R: Stat you know step 656 we talked about sentiment analysis and that is a technique for judging whether the emotional content of what's being talked about or what's being said.

184
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:33.930
Jones, Edward R: And you might recall, we use the a thin version of sentiment analysis, which means that words were signed were identified as emotional words and if they were sentiment words, they would receive a weight like anywhere from minus five through a plus five.

185
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:43.020
Jones, Edward R: But Google has their own version of sentiment analysis and we're going to look at that and it's going to be a scale between minus one in plus one.

186
00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:57.810
Jones, Edward R: Well, so there's that hack actually has kind of an audience by steel, for me, because i'm thinking well it's always a pain trying to figure out what is a minus three what does that mean well it, whereas if it's a minus point eight I know it's like it's 80% negative.

187
00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:09.810
Jones, Edward R: it's a plus point eight it's like 80% positive because something like that right so also the technique that's being used here with Google is very different, the.

188
00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:23.100
Jones, Edward R: The afm technique you ever you have a dictionary of emotional words and each this is additional one word each word that's in that dictionary is assign weights of minus five plus five.

189
00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:32.130
Jones, Edward R: Google does it differently they're using deep learning techniques and so they're going to be there, they have basically when about fitting.

190
00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:40.500
Jones, Edward R: Deep learning fitting neural networks that will predict what the emotional content is for the entire sentence or paragraph.

191
00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:47.640
Jones, Edward R: Based upon the combination of words, not just a single word counts, but the combination of words and so.

192
00:24:48.060 --> 00:25:02.250
Jones, Edward R: In some regards I think that they're there to approach is more robust than the fan approach but we'll take a look at that so let's go back to a campus and show you let me show you where we are.

193
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:08.700
Jones, Edward R: Okay, we aren't there I can't post right okay wait a minute.

194
00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:20.760
Jones, Edward R: let's black there we go okay so there's a folder on week six call in LP natural language processing files right let's open that up.

195
00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:33.660
Jones, Edward R: And you can see, there are a bunch of files in here there we're going to look at the first one we're going to look at it, as nlp one so let's click on that download it and open it up in.

196
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.490
Jones, Edward R: In.

197
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:41.010
Jones, Edward R: Okay, where are we here.

198
00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:50.730
Jones, Edward R: Oh, is this is this noise, like the always apple is wants to be so sure about Python.

199
00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:53.100
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

200
00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:03.600
Jones, Edward R: Why are we doing that okay don't do that.

201
00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.000
Jones, Edward R: So.

202
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:26.580
Jones, Edward R: So i'm going to be sure, wherever you you're you're taking the nlp one right and i'm putting that in my week five folder now be sure, wherever you're putting it that you have the Jason the credentials in that in that directory.

203
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.210
Jones, Edward R: So.

204
00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:37.170
Okay.

205
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:47.550
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

206
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:02.340
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

207
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:07.110
Jones, Edward R: So should have Google, where is it.

208
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.280
Jones, Edward R: There, oh no yeah there it is okay.

209
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.680
Jones, Edward R: So.

210
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.650
Jones, Edward R: The the natural language processor in Google is.

211
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:35.940
Jones, Edward R: fairly straightforward.

212
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:49.020
Jones, Edward R: You do need to have installed the what's called the Google cloud language version one underscore V1.

213
00:27:50.370 --> 00:28:03.000
Jones, Edward R: So I believe you already have that installed because that's the that's the the import that we use with translating texts boy, you know texts that translating text.

214
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:14.880
Jones, Edward R: So if you should have import Google dot out a u Th that's the Google routine that we use to authenticate using credentials credentials.

215
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:29.190
Jones, Edward R: And then from Google cloud import language underscore V1 version one as language Okay, so this is a library, whether we're going to be using the language underscore V one.

216
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:48.870
Jones, Edward R: There are two functions at the top, one of them is get text sentiment and the other is get text classification for now we're just going to talk about sentiment, how you how they how that's handled when you call this function at the top yeah you have your credentials here client.

217
00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:59.070
Jones, Edward R: That are being passed in, and then the text now that could be a single sentence or it could be a paragraph or it could be an entire book.

218
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:00.990
Jones, Edward R: A long string.

219
00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:09.480
Jones, Edward R: You have to set up the document characteristics and so you see document, and you can see language document.

220
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:23.940
Jones, Edward R: And it's of course it's text language is een it turns out that you can get some of it for other languages about 10 or so languages and Spanish is one of them.

221
00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:39.210
Jones, Edward R: And you do that by e N, is for English, but then you change that to as if you're doing Spanish it for Italian and so forth, and so on, this is very cool because I don't have the a fan list for Spanish.

222
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:51.480
Jones, Edward R: At the fan approach is strictly English, so what they've done somebody did a lot of work here they fit a neural network to all these different languages, where.

223
00:29:51.720 --> 00:30:07.740
Jones, Edward R: You know the the way you would do this in a practical sense is you take a bunch of movie reviews and on the movies, this is OK for star three star five Star and then you fit a neural network to predict the number of stars based upon the words the words that are in that.

224
00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.220
Jones, Edward R: You know that critique.

225
00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:22.500
Jones, Edward R: And so, then you would have a model than the model says you give me a paragraph i'm going to check the words in there and i'm going to cook the and i'm going to then predict the number of stars, the.

226
00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:26.940
Jones, Edward R: sentiment for that particular combination.

227
00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:34.440
Jones, Edward R: So that's a sort of a general way that they have done this and it doesn't matter whether it's Spanish Chinese or English.

228
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:54.000
Jones, Edward R: You can fit that model for any for any particular language provided you have a good corpus, a good collection of reviews in that language that you feel are good to worth doing now The other thing you see here, it says type language document type plain text oh.

229
00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.090
Jones, Edward R: Jones Could I just oh.

230
00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:57.480
Jones, Edward R: hi there.

231
00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:06.930
Fireman, Karen: I don't know if we have this in our library so there's something we can do for pip install or would we want.

232
00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:07.470
Jones, Edward R: Those.

233
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:09.060
Jones, Edward R: What do you, what is your question Karen.

234
00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.030
Fireman, Karen: it's throwing an error, just when i'm trying to do.

235
00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:13.500
Jones, Edward R: you're trying to run this and it's giving you.

236
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.380
Fireman, Karen: Just the three import statements and 789.

237
00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:22.440
Jones, Edward R: Okay, you probably don't have these things installed on your computer, for your environment.

238
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:30.030
Fireman, Karen: Right so i'm in the right environment, so I guess, maybe, none of us has it So what do we do condo or pip or what is the right thing.

239
00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.110
well.

240
00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:32.910
Jones, Edward R: let's.

241
00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:40.110
Jones, Edward R: You should be you should have, I think we haven't we should have been installing this in the earlier.

242
00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:42.300
Fireman, Karen: Everything.

243
00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:50.760
Swanson J, Charles Richard: Dr Jones, this is the House um we don't have the language underscore V1 from Google cloud.

244
00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:53.640
Jones, Edward R: Okay that's the one.

245
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:58.500
Jones, Edward R: I think let's hang on just a second here.

246
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:11.160
Jones, Edward R: I believe you just you just say Google cloud language be one, but let me, let me double check on that, while we're here.

247
00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.910
Kilani, Shadi: also need to enable it in your Google profile.

248
00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.800
Kilani, Shadi: allow it to operate to me do that as well.

249
00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:26.430
Jones, Edward R: Well, hang on just a second here.

250
00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:31.290
Coleman, Clay: We shouldn't have to do you shouldn't have to enable and it should already be enabled.

251
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.480
Coleman, Clay: Right, rather than others.

252
00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:36.990
Jones, Edward R: dead depends if it's it would be if you picked it in the right directory.

253
00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.070
Jones, Edward R: Right so Google cloud.

254
00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:45.030
Jones, Edward R: language.

255
00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:55.260
Fireman, Karen: Thank you for your help on this.

256
00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.210
Jones, Edward R: One okay.

257
00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:06.390
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so here it is.

258
00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:15.120
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

259
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:21.630
Coleman, Clay: If you check the chat we've also it's it's pip install Google dash cloud bash language.

260
00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:24.120
Fireman, Karen: Okay, thank you, thank you.

261
00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:32.760
Jones, Edward R: that's what I thought it was so it's it's Google cloud language to underscore V1 right.

262
00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:33.810
Fireman, Karen: No V1.

263
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:38.640
Coleman, Clay: No it's just pip install Google dash cloud dash language.

264
00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:41.280
Jones, Edward R: No V1.

265
00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:42.990
Fireman, Karen: Nobody one.

266
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.900
Fireman, Karen: And then do we have to do anything else clay or now it'll work.

267
00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.790
Coleman, Clay: I don't know I haven't tried it since then, but that's that's the install that.

268
00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:55.320
Jones, Edward R: Normally, you know, normally, what I do is I go into spider and do this and spider.

269
00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.760
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so down here on the end the icon to support over here.

270
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:02.820
Jones, Edward R: Normally I try to go pip.

271
00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:14.850
Jones, Edward R: In the environment i'm working in a certain environment here i'm in this case, I have a Google environment, so I say pip install.

272
00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:20.880
Jones, Edward R: And then just Google cloud.

273
00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:22.710
Jones, Edward R: That language.

274
00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:24.600
Jones, Edward R: like that.

275
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.200
Jones, Edward R: and

276
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:30.870
Jones, Edward R: In my case it's going to say.

277
00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:40.020
Jones, Edward R: spam.

278
00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:44.190
Jones, Edward R: What does it say.

279
00:34:45.450 --> 00:34:50.160
Jones, Edward R: cannot find a version that satisfies the requirement Google cloud language.

280
00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:52.140
Jones, Edward R: From versions.

281
00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:54.450
Fireman, Karen: They were dashes, I think, maybe.

282
00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:58.410
Fireman, Karen: One or dashes not dance.

283
00:34:59.670 --> 00:35:03.390
Jones, Edward R: Here, but you said you said it was Google cloud that language right oh.

284
00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:05.790
Fireman, Karen: No, the periods are hyphens.

285
00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.670
Coleman, Clay: it's yeah it's a dash not a dot.

286
00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:15.720
Fireman, Karen: dash.

287
00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.200
Fireman, Karen: Here back up to the period.

288
00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:21.270
Fireman, Karen: yep.

289
00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.910
Fireman, Karen: And the next one's a dash awesome.

290
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:25.890
Fireman, Karen: Yes.

291
00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:27.600
Jones, Edward R: It is oh.

292
00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:28.560
Fireman, Karen: Give us the G.

293
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:30.120
Faculty Office Hours: Look in the chat.

294
00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:37.470
Jones, Edward R: yeah see I got a small screen I don't see a chat.

295
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:42.960
Fireman, Karen: If this now worked I tried it.

296
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:44.580
Jones, Edward R: Look, if.

297
00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:48.210
Wilson Pineda: You misspell install Dr Jones.

298
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.600
Fireman, Karen: Oh, you did install is in school yeah.

299
00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.040
Jones, Edward R: I don't see a chat.

300
00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:58.680
Fireman, Karen: If install it there's a queue instead of an A.

301
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:00.300
Fireman, Karen: There you go.

302
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:03.900
Jones, Edward R: yeah well it's already installed on my computer so that's.

303
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:08.400
Fireman, Karen: Oh, you got it okay we've got it to thank you.

304
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:14.400
Jones, Edward R: So it's pip install Google dash cloud Dutch Dutch language and know be one.

305
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:16.410
Fireman, Karen: Perfect Novi one.

306
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.720
Fireman, Karen: that's it Okay, thank you.

307
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:19.860
and

308
00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:26.160
Jones, Edward R: Now, after you do that sort of thing you're going to have you should restart the current.

309
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:42.000
Jones, Edward R: So make sure you're doing this, all within the environment that where you want us to be resident, I have three or four environment, so if I did it in one in the base environment and then moved over to a different environment they wouldn't see it.

310
00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:52.350
Jones, Edward R: So after do the fifth thing then normally you restart the I would normally restart the Colonel up here go to restart.

311
00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:58.140
Jones, Edward R: And then do Google music condo list.

312
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:01.290
Jones, Edward R: So, like john.

313
00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.480
Jones, Edward R: And it's kinda.

314
00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:08.850
Jones, Edward R: list.

315
00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:19.020
Jones, Edward R: which shows everything that kind of sees as far as install packages sister concern, and if we scroll through this up to Google.

316
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:32.370
Jones, Edward R: So you should see cloud dash language Novi one.

317
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.610
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

318
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:37.290
Fireman, Karen: Yes.

319
00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:44.490
Jones, Edward R: you're right i'm sorry for all the trouble I thought we had already installed this.

320
00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:50.520
Jones, Edward R: I we'd start we install the speech and the text to speech and the translate all that.

321
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:54.690
Jones, Edward R: We just hadn't we hadn't installed, the language.

322
00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.510
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

323
00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:01.110
Jones, Edward R: All right.

324
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:12.570
Jones, Edward R: So we can move ahead, I was, I was just talking about the document characteristics, and so one of the characteristics that's useful is to be able to change the language.

325
00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:21.990
Jones, Edward R: The other thing that's useful here is the type, in addition to plain text you can you can have this actually look at html.

326
00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:29.550
Jones, Edward R: That means you can process a web page without having to convert it to pull out the text.

327
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:45.750
Jones, Edward R: So this has been built smart enough so that it will actually read html and gentlemen and basically ignore the markup symbols and language that's in the html webpage html and then produces a sentiment for that webpage.

328
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:58.950
Jones, Edward R: The next thing that you see, is it says responses equal to client dot analyze sentiments, so this is going to go into the language package.

329
00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:06.990
Jones, Edward R: And this is a class, then the language package for analyzing sentiment client, of course, is your credentials that are passed him.

330
00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:21.450
Jones, Edward R: document equal to the document, the document is described in that upper line right here in coding type is equal to now the reason, this is there is because some languages don't use.

331
00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:37.920
Jones, Edward R: Our form of encoding ut of 32 or ut of eight, so these were often these would be like Asian languages, where they have different symbols, and so they they can change the encoding type correspond to the language that you're using.

332
00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:50.940
Jones, Edward R: And then you just say sentiment is equal to response dot document sentiment and and then you'll get the return the sentiment score.

333
00:39:51.690 --> 00:40:03.000
Jones, Edward R: So that's that's basically in a nutshell, how you go about getting sentiment from a single string or if it's a document and you represent that document by a string.

334
00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:10.170
Jones, Edward R: In addition to that this package allows us to do classification Now this is kind of cool.

335
00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:19.590
Jones, Edward R: When we didn't we didn't talk about this it wasn't something that we had available to us and natural language, processing and 656.

336
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:29.640
Jones, Edward R: And 656 we focused on sentiment and also topic analysis, you know, identifying what we're really talking about what are the topics that they're talking about well.

337
00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:42.630
Jones, Edward R: They have something here, which is not topic analysis but sort of similar and they're calling it classification and what it is, is they have about 20 or 30 business type classifications.

338
00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:54.060
Jones, Edward R: And they go into the document and determine whether what the what is the probability that this document corresponds to this particular category.

339
00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:57.990
Jones, Edward R: For example, one of the categories is computer and technology.

340
00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:05.490
Jones, Edward R: And so, if they look at the document and they're looking for they're looking for certain keywords like computer related words they see a bunch of them.

341
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:13.440
Jones, Edward R: Then they will tell you that this document is it belongs part of the document anyway belongs to the category computers.

342
00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:30.150
Jones, Edward R: And that gives you a confidence number, which is a number between zero and one about how strong that relationship is so this allows you to look at business documents very quickly and find out identify once that might or might not be more related to what you're looking for.

343
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:31.950
Jones, Edward R: and

344
00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:43.110
Jones, Edward R: It returns that information, the categories associated with each document, and then the confidence or probability that that categories associated with that document.

345
00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:53.940
Jones, Edward R: And you have the same kind of structure where you first set up the document type, so the text the the language and plain text or html.

346
00:41:54.810 --> 00:42:05.910
Jones, Edward R: And the you do a response, but when you do the response, instead of going client Doc sentiment analyze sentiment you're doing quiet dot classify text.

347
00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:28.710
Jones, Edward R: And then it'll returns or gives you that classification now we're going to take a look at both of these and for in this particular analysis we're going to look at an x an excel file and the excel file is also in the week six folder it's called text sentiment cases.

348
00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:43.770
Jones, Edward R: And so, if you could please download text send them a cases and put them in I have it right now the best says folder called excel and I put them in that excel file folder.

349
00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:55.380
Jones, Edward R: right next to the code that i'm running and it's called text sentiment cases Now let me check to make sure it's there and in this computer.

350
00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:02.100
Jones, Edward R: So there is an excel folder right up here at the top of that up and you can see, it says.

351
00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:04.830
Jones, Edward R: It says test.

352
00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:10.200
Jones, Edward R: sentiment cases is a tester texts, what is the code say again.

353
00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:13.530
Jones, Edward R: The town.

354
00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:15.390
Jones, Edward R: test.

355
00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:17.370
Fireman, Karen: test test yeah.

356
00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:22.740
Jones, Edward R: So it's test pst cinema cases let's.

357
00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.100
Jones, Edward R: let's go ahead and run this and.

358
00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:30.600
Jones, Edward R: you'll see on the what happens.

359
00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:50.550
Jones, Edward R: And so there it goes what it's doing is it's taking each sentence this excel file has about 20 different sentences and it calculates the sentiment for each one of those those lines now i'd like you to open up.

360
00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:51.540
Jones, Edward R: That file.

361
00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:54.150
Jones, Edward R: test set of cases.

362
00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:58.470
Fireman, Karen: So, Dr Jones.

363
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.970
Jones, Edward R: Was this.

364
00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:07.020
Fireman, Karen: Is Karen was hanging up online 49 text equals contents, it says content is not defined did I miss something up.

365
00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:11.250
Jones, Edward R: What is lead line three nights six give me a.

366
00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:15.450
Fireman, Karen: 949 says text equals contents or maybe I don't have a whole thing.

367
00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:18.240
Jones, Edward R: Okay line number 49 is blank on my screen.

368
00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:24.030
Fireman, Karen: text my the wrong file.

369
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:25.920
Coleman, Clay: Oh Karen if you look at his.

370
00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.110
Coleman, Clay: His paper he's getting the same error.

371
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:31.560
Coleman, Clay: Oh man contents not defined right there.

372
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:32.790
Fireman, Karen: Online at seven.

373
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:34.080
Oh.

374
00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.680
Jones, Edward R: Thank you see what happened here hang on.

375
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:45.600
Brian Frankel: You check the chat the solution has been provided by Robert line 78 says to be modified slightly.

376
00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:51.630
Fireman, Karen: But mine is on 49 does nobody ever does anybody else have that same problem 149.

377
00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:06.150
Jones, Edward R: there's another file this this this is this is there's another file that is trying to read it's called IBM texts txt txt.

378
00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:09.630
Jones, Edward R: And it's looking at looking for a folder.

379
00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:15.840
Jones, Edward R: Okay, I thought I took I thought I took all of this out of this program.

380
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:19.980
Fireman, Karen: One other question for you, Sir, are we using nlp one or an MP3.

381
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:22.080
Jones, Edward R: Oh, this is this is.

382
00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:24.480
Fireman, Karen: Violence this which which file.

383
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:26.430
Jones, Edward R: It should be one, but it looks.

384
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:27.450
Fireman, Karen: Like it's a look.

385
00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:31.710
Jones, Edward R: It looks like it's the whole all three of them actually.

386
00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:33.450
Jones, Edward R: alright.

387
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.980
Jones, Edward R: So.

388
00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:36.480
Fireman, Karen: As line numbers one or two.

389
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:39.540
Jones, Edward R: It looks like it's all three of them, and not just.

390
00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:56.610
Jones, Edward R: Not just the I took the main file this file and I broke it up into three pieces so that So if you could with me for me go ahead and take all of the lines from number 49 all the way to the bottom, and do, and erase them.

391
00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:01.140
Jones, Edward R: Like just like i'm doing down here.

392
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.490
Jones, Edward R: So that's that's what happened here just do that.

393
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:14.520
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so that I only wanted to process that excel file not not those other files here.

394
00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:21.540
Jones, Edward R: So if we run this now that we shouldn't you shouldn't see any strange business at the bottom.

395
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:25.410
Jones, Edward R: There all right there we go.

396
00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:36.660
Jones, Edward R: 49 and on should be erased and then go to the excel file here and that you have an open it up.

397
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:42.030
Jones, Edward R: Coming up here.

398
00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:12.240
Jones, Edward R: was just taking show on.

399
00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:14.790
Jones, Edward R: verifying excel.

400
00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:25.350
Fireman, Karen: Does it care if they're capitals and smalls and the names it doesn't matter right.

401
00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:28.860
Faculty Office Hours: Now it matters care.

402
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.450
Fireman, Karen: Okay.

403
00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:34.020
Faculty Office Hours: What depends on Linux or windows, but yeah.

404
00:47:35.370 --> 00:47:40.800
Fireman, Karen: i'm in windows and I have something with a capital excel on a small excel a small ones not showing up.

405
00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:46.980
Fireman, Karen: that's what i'm asking it's not copying it in but it's not.

406
00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:53.220
Jones, Edward R: Okay it's not that some things are this computers like it's not opening this up it's not like this will open it.

407
00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.630
Jones, Edward R: So this is an excel problem for me.

408
00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:13.650
Jones, Edward R: There it is I don't want to go along Okay, so this is the excel file and I hope you can see, this on your screen, if you have a copy of it.

409
00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:19.350
Jones, Edward R: And i'm going to make this larger so that it'll show up a little better.

410
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:26.340
Jones, Edward R: Okay, there can you read that okay.

411
00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:32.340
Jones, Edward R: All right, the first sentence, the first sentence is, this is a bad movie right so that's negative sentiment.

412
00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:42.180
Jones, Edward R: The eighth and analysis gives you the gives that sentence a score have negative three and the Google sentiment is negative point nine.

413
00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:51.960
Jones, Edward R: So both of them are showing this is highly negative, this is a good movie, then you get a plus three and a point nine so they're they're kind of consistent here.

414
00:48:53.490 --> 00:49:05.070
Jones, Edward R: In that in that regard, this is not a bad movie Okay, so that gets a plus three in a fun analysis, but only a point five in Google.

415
00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:16.260
Jones, Edward R: So that seems to be a little bit odd there because I would have thought it would be just the opposite of you know, the other 1.9 0.9.

416
00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:25.260
Jones, Edward R: And then you have, this is not a good movie movie and you get a minus three for the fan and a minus point nine for Google see that.

417
00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:35.610
Jones, Edward R: So why do we get a point five instead of point nine, and this has to do, I think, with the the moat they're using some kind of model, a neural network model.

418
00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:46.530
Jones, Edward R: And so it's not just looking at not and bad, but probably also movie and it's it's looking historically at when people say it's not a bad movie.

419
00:49:47.610 --> 00:50:04.200
Jones, Edward R: Is that a point nine is very, very positive very enthusiastic and what google's saying is that well it doesn't really mean that it's all of that good it's not a bad you know, usually if I say something, and it wasn't bad and then.

420
00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:07.650
Jones, Edward R: Somebody was great okay.

421
00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:23.220
Jones, Edward R: So that wasn't bad So you can see how these two two different here are the point nine being very, very positive are very negative, and here I get a negative two, for I did not like this movie.

422
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:28.110
Jones, Edward R: And a negative point nine, which is very negative right for Google.

423
00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:32.730
Jones, Edward R: And then you can see how they they switch up now look at this one.

424
00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:37.410
Jones, Edward R: This this this one, I saw was interesting that was a sin.

425
00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:41.760
Jones, Edward R: ethan says that's neutral sentiment.

426
00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:44.340
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

427
00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:48.240
Jones, Edward R: And Google is saying no no that's good.

428
00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:51.540
Jones, Edward R: That was a sin okay.

429
00:50:52.680 --> 00:51:00.780
Jones, Edward R: and the next one that was sinful I would have thought those two would have gotten the same score that that was assuming that was simple right.

430
00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:17.910
Jones, Edward R: i'm not sure what the difference is grammatically I think that is that was a sin is probably grammatically incorrect, but you can see that was sinful is to get a fantasy in it, oh that's a negative three and Google is saying not so bad.

431
00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:34.410
Jones, Edward R: Really okay So you see, they do differ in some areas and and when I looked over this entire list, which is not exhaustive that just to say you know these are one word one sentiment word per sentence, so to speak.

432
00:51:36.210 --> 00:51:50.460
Jones, Edward R: But what I found was that the the Google seem to be going, you know negative nine positive point nine and, whereas the a fan you get numbers so more very numbers.

433
00:51:51.240 --> 00:52:02.220
Jones, Edward R: But, in general, if they use it, the university rarely do you see where Google says it's negative and Nathan says it's positive you don't see that kind of a change.

434
00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:11.880
Jones, Edward R: So I think they're in for the most part, consistent with one another, but I do like the way that Google handles handles us a little bit better.

435
00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:21.600
Jones, Edward R: Because I think it's taking a more holistic approach by looking at the entire collection of worse, not just a single word or two words that are in the document.

436
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:26.370
Jones, Edward R: But maybe somebody could do a project on this right.

437
00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:36.810
Jones, Edward R: That would be a good project say check them out to how are you comparing the fan list of the Google list and the try to characterize in some way.

438
00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:45.450
Jones, Edward R: How they're the same how and where they are different, maybe find some cases that that they're very different and then.

439
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:55.350
Jones, Edward R: Try to investigate that a little bit and see why that might be the white by that that might that be, by the way, I haven't found all the documentation on the Google side.

440
00:52:57.390 --> 00:53:06.930
Jones, Edward R: There should be some documentation on more specifically, how they generate their sentiments and using their newer letter work or what have you.

441
00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:12.480
Jones, Edward R: Okay let's go back to the week for.

442
00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:19.590
Fireman, Karen: James, can I ask you a question on 38 i'm throwing an error that I can stand it saying.

443
00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:24.930
Fireman, Karen: xlr D and I already installed xlr D.

444
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:26.910
Fireman, Karen: it's not working.

445
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:37.320
Fireman, Karen: Online 38 D E, F equals PD dot read excel excel file it's not working it's a really simple statement but it's not working.

446
00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.710
Swanson J, Charles Richard: Karen do you have an excel folder.

447
00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:43.620
Fireman, Karen: In yes, yes, I do and I have that file in.

448
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.090
Swanson J, Charles Richard: All right, don't know what did you.

449
00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:51.990
Fireman, Karen: shake your take that out, but I, but I have one okay.

450
00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:53.850
Swanson J, Charles Richard: But I probably directory issue.

451
00:53:55.260 --> 00:54:00.180
Fireman, Karen: No, I don't know it says i'm says.

452
00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:06.360
Fireman, Karen: I don't know there's 10 lines always D F equals PD read that that that line and.

453
00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:08.130
Jones, Edward R: Which one, are you talking about.

454
00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:15.270
Fireman, Karen: 3838 we're def equals PD read excel excel file that one.

455
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:19.110
Jones, Edward R: Okay that's what that's what pandas do you have worked pandas.

456
00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:20.160
Fireman, Karen: I sure do.

457
00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:22.710
Fireman, Karen: Yes, sir.

458
00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:23.670
yeah.

459
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:32.520
Jones, Edward R: And is the is that the file name exactly the same as you see there in the in the line 37.

460
00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:34.620
Fireman, Karen: Well, I think so.

461
00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:37.050
Jones, Edward R: to sit reading part of the file and not the rest of it.

462
00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:39.570
Fireman, Karen: I don't think it's reading any of it.

463
00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:47.100
Jones, Edward R: Okay, then I would double check to make sure that the path that you see there is exactly where you, you have.

464
00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:55.950
Jones, Edward R: When you're in windows, when you download it sometimes it'll insert a one or two, in the name I hate that.

465
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:59.910
Fireman, Karen: I know what you mean but I don't think that's there i'll double check I don't I know.

466
00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:05.850
Jones, Edward R: Tom check check your check your window go into that directory make sure the excel directory.

467
00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:08.430
Jones, Edward R: is in the same folder with your code.

468
00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:09.480
Fireman, Karen: yeah it is.

469
00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:14.760
Jones, Edward R: And then, make sure that the file is spelled exactly the will you see here in the line 37.

470
00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:24.390
Fireman, Karen: test sentiment cases with individual caps on each one dot X X X El es es that's what you've got.

471
00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:25.860
Jones, Edward R: uh huh.

472
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:27.270
Can you open it in excel.

473
00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.710
Fireman, Karen: Can I open it I guess i'll try that's a good question.

474
00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:33.990
Fireman, Karen: yeah.

475
00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:36.240
Jones, Edward R: It may have gotten corrupted when you download it in.

476
00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:39.240
Fireman, Karen: A way it works.

477
00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:44.760
Faculty Office Hours: I Karen quite foot chat he is there's a package that.

478
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:50.820
Faculty Office Hours: The pip install that he has to install to get that to work.

479
00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:55.410
Fireman, Karen: Oh i'm sorry where's that Thank you oh Okay, thank you both you.

480
00:55:56.970 --> 00:55:58.320
Fireman, Karen: see that I was looking.

481
00:56:00.810 --> 00:56:02.010
Fireman, Karen: At the install open.

482
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:03.840
Fireman, Karen: Thank you.

483
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:10.950
Jones, Edward R: What is the package, what are we talking about here who shouldn't open P, why so.

484
00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:18.930
Coleman, Clay: yeah it, so I went through the documentation and every time I was getting the same error, I had solid XL RD.

485
00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:32.100
Coleman, Clay: But it didn't apparently I installed the 2.0 point one version and it didn't want that one, and then it asked me to a pip install open P, why excel and then everything works not sure what's going.

486
00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:34.410
Jones, Edward R: On in here but supposed to be just appear to school.

487
00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:41.070
Coleman, Clay: yeah no I I saw that it's something about the sls file extension that it didn't like.

488
00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:49.260
Jones, Edward R: Well i've been using Panda screw you know some years and never have that perfect home.

489
00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:51.840
Coleman, Clay: yeah no sense of you it worked.

490
00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:52.350
Fireman, Karen: Thank you.

491
00:56:52.740 --> 00:57:00.780
Coleman, Clay: same same here same here, but I i'm not sure it's just not liking, the file extension xlr sucks.

492
00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:06.630
Jones, Edward R: hmm that's the new system they've been so some number of years.

493
00:57:08.850 --> 00:57:10.410
Jones, Edward R: So that means band, this is a bug.

494
00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:17.250
Coleman, Clay: it's possible that already had a dependency that wasn't installed.

495
00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:23.160
Jones, Edward R: I don't know if anybody finds out, let me know.

496
00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:28.170
Coleman, Clay: Oh let's right there Craig it's a recent change due to security hole at their.

497
00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:30.120
Jones, Edward R: advantage to change.

498
00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:36.330
Coleman, Clay: yeah it used to now uses open P, why XL engine interesting there you go.

499
00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:37.500
Look.

500
00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:42.840
Jones, Edward R: So i'm using i'm probably using the previous version, or something and that's why.

501
00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:46.920
Jones, Edward R: it's not worth it works for me then work for you, I say.

502
00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:53.190
Fireman, Karen: One other question on that on that change you having a chat on changing line 78, what are we changing it to.

503
00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:57.810
Coleman, Clay: We don't we deleted everything past line 49 so it.

504
00:57:57.810 --> 00:57:58.290
Coleman, Clay: Should matter.

505
00:57:58.890 --> 00:57:59.220
Okay.

506
00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:02.760
Jones, Edward R: Okay let's see if we can.

507
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:10.830
Jones, Edward R: Open up kiva mpl to if you download Google infield to nlp to excuse me.

508
00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:14.850
Jones, Edward R: and

509
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:17.940
Jones, Edward R: we're going to take a look at that one.

510
00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:19.920
Jones, Edward R: So.

511
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:26.340
Jones, Edward R: Open that Google nlp to.

512
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:31.530
Jones, Edward R: Let me, let me double check real quick to make sure I got the right one here.

513
00:58:35.370 --> 00:58:35.820
Jones, Edward R: whoops.

514
00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:43.560
Jones, Edward R: yeah.

515
00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:49.830
Jones, Edward R: So this file we're using the same functions text sentiment and text classification.

516
00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:52.980
Jones, Edward R: But instead of looking at the.

517
00:58:54.030 --> 00:59:15.630
Jones, Edward R: excel spreadsheet we're going to like take a look at one text file and that's IBM dot txt, which is also available in the week six folder as you'll see a folder there a file called IBM dot txt that you'll want to download that and put it into a directory called text.

518
00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:20.490
Jones, Edward R: If you can let me double check mine and see if it's there.

519
00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:26.430
Fireman, Karen: same errors coming up with the contents to be deleted again part of the file.

520
00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:31.710
Fireman, Karen: Line 46.

521
00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:36.360
Fireman, Karen: Sir, it says text equals contents.

522
00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.400
Fireman, Karen: Not to find.

523
00:59:57.510 --> 01:00:02.880
Coleman, Clay: Did you check your IBM texts and make sure to the correct file for the file folder.

524
01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:05.580
Fireman, Karen: i'll double check, I thought so but i'll double check.

525
01:00:15.330 --> 01:00:16.050
Jones, Edward R: yeah IBM.

526
01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:17.820
Fireman, Karen: IBM is not.

527
01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:18.510
Okay.

528
01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:21.210
Fireman, Karen: Okay, thanks.

529
01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:38.730
Fireman, Karen: Young oh there it is.

530
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:45.150
Fireman, Karen: It doesn't seem to be downloading when I click on it, you have to right click it you.

531
01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:52.410
Fireman, Karen: know how do you save this I get to save it once it opens.

532
01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:08.880
Jones, Edward R: Alright, so if you have that setup you have a directory called text and then in there, IBM dot txt.

533
01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:12.780
Jones, Edward R: And we're going to run in peel nlp.

534
01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:17.700
Jones, Edward R: And we'll try that here.

535
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:27.210
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so in this case, what we're doing is we're taking a look at a entire document, instead of just one sentence.

536
01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:37.770
Jones, Edward R: And we're going to get the sentiment for that document, so I just ran it in mind is this is what i'm seeing on the right hand side here.

537
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:49.980
Jones, Edward R: So what it does, is it first just displays the entire paragraph, which is the description of IBM that you get from alpha vantage.

538
01:01:51.570 --> 01:02:01.050
Jones, Edward R: And it says that the entire text sentiment in magnitude is zero sentiment and the magnitude of point seven.

539
01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:18.360
Jones, Edward R: The the sentiment is really the number we're looking for so they're saying that this is neutral not positive not negative and how was that done what it was done the same way that we just did except instead of sending a sentence we're sending the entire paragraph.

540
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:21.990
Jones, Edward R: So here we're opening the file.

541
01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:34.950
Jones, Edward R: And then reading that and putting the contents of that file in a variable called contents and then I move that over to a variable called text and here's the document set up plain text.

542
01:02:36.270 --> 01:02:38.400
Jones, Edward R: The response analyze sentiment.

543
01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:45.120
Jones, Edward R: And then the actual should have a calculation itself right here.

544
01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:51.480
Fireman, Karen: So quick question for you, Sir in phone if the try except doesn't work, and it goes to accept that he won't have.

545
01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.940
Fireman, Karen: thing in the text, because the content will be empty.

546
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:56.340
Jones, Edward R: I do understand what you're saying.

547
01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:04.650
Fireman, Karen: Online 38 try except if it goes to accept you won't have anything to execute online 46 calls texts and contents won't be there.

548
01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:12.000
Jones, Edward R: yeah I should add all you're doing when if it fails you're just going to get an error message.

549
01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:14.550
Fireman, Karen: 46 it'll fail.

550
01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:17.790
Fireman, Karen: Because there won't be a contents to that you load it in the trash.

551
01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:18.990
Jones, Edward R: that's right that's right.

552
01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:20.850
Fireman, Karen: So that's what's happening online.

553
01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.910
Jones, Edward R: it'll say unable to open and then it'll fail.

554
01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:25.020
Fireman, Karen: Right.

555
01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:33.450
Jones, Edward R: that's right because it's trying to open and if it can't if the files not there if it doesn't see the file it can't open it it's going to fail.

556
01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:35.520
Because they can't go any faster.

557
01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:37.560
Jones, Edward R: yeah.

558
01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:49.560
Jones, Edward R: Now some people would put an exit or you know, an exit out right in here underneath that pretty but I didn't bother with it.

559
01:03:50.790 --> 01:03:53.640
Jones, Edward R: So, are you are you getting the exception on able to open.

560
01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:59.520
Fireman, Karen: yeah and I don't know why, but maybe I just rerun the Colonel another work, maybe nope same problem.

561
01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:02.520
Jones, Edward R: it's No, this is a standard text file.

562
01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.110
excel.

563
01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:08.730
Jones, Edward R: So you want to make sure that you, you have the full.

564
01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:17.520
Fireman, Karen: text oh okay Thank you, Sir, I see it now, thank you got it it's in texts, not an xml got it.

565
01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:19.110
Jones, Edward R: Right.

566
01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:24.750
Jones, Edward R: yeah i'm not using pandas here we're just using the standard Python read text file.

567
01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:33.870
Jones, Edward R: And then, what happens is it comes when it actually prints out the sentiment, for you here.

568
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:41.790
Jones, Edward R: And then it does have the second time showing a different technique, the same you're getting the same number.

569
01:04:44.310 --> 01:04:53.460
Jones, Edward R: In one case i'm using response document underscore sentiment and then the other case i'm using client to analyze sentiment.

570
01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:56.910
Jones, Edward R: Okay, give you the same number.

571
01:04:59.910 --> 01:05:02.580
Jones, Edward R: Then it goes forward and.

572
01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:10.440
Jones, Edward R: It is now going to look at the sentiment for each sentence in this document.

573
01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:14.820
Jones, Edward R: You can do that, and so it says for sentence.

574
01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:18.780
Jones, Edward R: In response response dot sentences.

575
01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:28.980
Jones, Edward R: So this is something that the Google people that provided for us the ability to sort of automatically go through a document and look at each sentence separately.

576
01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:47.700
Jones, Edward R: So this in some cases, could be useful, because you, you could see well, is there any expression of real negative content somewhere in the documents, and so the identify the sentence, where this occurs or positive where this occurs right.

577
01:05:48.810 --> 01:05:58.590
Jones, Edward R: So in this little for loop for sentence and response synthesis allows you to go through the document and for each sentence do whatever you want.

578
01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:05.910
Jones, Edward R: And in this case, what we're doing is we're actually looking at the sentiment score for each sentence separately.

579
01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:16.890
Jones, Edward R: And you'll see at the bottom here, then it prints out it's showing you sentence, you know number one number two number three actually given you the text for that sentiment.

580
01:06:17.370 --> 01:06:25.980
Jones, Edward R: And then the score now most of these are scoring zero this, this is, overall, overall, this the score zero for the entire document.

581
01:06:26.490 --> 01:06:35.580
Jones, Edward R: But there are a couple places where it sounds a little negative to the system and negative point to here for that sentence and negative point one.

582
01:06:36.270 --> 01:06:45.750
Jones, Edward R: not terribly bad, but most of them are neutral zero the company was founded in 1911 and is headquartered in armonk.

583
01:06:46.710 --> 01:07:05.220
Jones, Edward R: New York so that's the sea rooms and then there is a there are a total of nine sentences and if you looked at the total sentiment from all of that adding up all of the ones you get a negative point one actually should have been negative, this is the.

584
01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:12.330
Jones, Edward R: i'm not sure that should have been a negative point three Okay, other than that happen.

585
01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:21.270
Jones, Edward R: So average total sentiment of CTI.

586
01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:31.800
Jones, Edward R: that's weird.

587
01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:33.480
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

588
01:07:36.270 --> 01:07:37.890
Jones, Edward R: Because like i've got one since.

589
01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:42.720
Fireman, Karen: Waiting aren't you waiting it by the length of a sentence, so that it's not just every.

590
01:07:42.930 --> 01:07:46.260
Jones, Edward R: Well, no that's a different that's a different different things, so this is.

591
01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:49.500
Jones, Edward R: This is the number right here says average sentiment.

592
01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:52.230
Jones, Edward R: And so that's.

593
01:07:53.280 --> 01:08:09.570
Jones, Edward R: Oh wait a minute, this makes this is correct yeah, no, no, the other one up there, the total sentiment, the total sentiment is this thing called is in e se mti total sentiment, then you can see that's just the collection of the addition of each sentiment score right here.

594
01:08:11.070 --> 01:08:11.760
Jones, Edward R: and

595
01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:20.760
Jones, Edward R: i'll have to go back and take a look into the mode to look at this but it looks like is the scenario that, because this is a negative to hear.

596
01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:31.500
Jones, Edward R: negative point two, and a negative point one here, it should have been a negative point three or unless there's some positive one here so oh there it is okay positive point to the top.

597
01:08:32.610 --> 01:08:38.760
Jones, Edward R: So there's a positive that positive point to we kills the negative two and it's right okay.

598
01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:44.910
Jones, Edward R: So more and more information, so this is how you do the entire document.

599
01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:48.510
Jones, Edward R: Larger document anyway.

600
01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:57.540
Jones, Edward R: Okay, one more to that will look at here and then we'll going to take a break there's one.

601
01:08:58.830 --> 01:09:08.940
Jones, Edward R: If we go to that week for folder there's one called in LP three and so i'm going to download that nlp three.

602
01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:14.610
Jones, Edward R: And, and then move that over into the same area.

603
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:18.270
Fireman, Karen: Does it go inside text or excel or something.

604
01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:22.050
Fireman, Karen: No okay.

605
01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:25.110
Jones, Edward R: This this is code.

606
01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:26.670
Jones, Edward R: Right nlp three.

607
01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:29.730
Jones, Edward R: and

608
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:37.110
Jones, Edward R: looks like it's having trouble coming down I guess everybody's doing the same time.

609
01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:22.680
Jones, Edward R: Okay looks like that came down and open it up now, this file is going to require one of the other files to and.

610
01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:29.250
Jones, Edward R: You know p3.

611
01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.300
Jones, Edward R: same sort of deal, except that this case we're.

612
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:45.630
Jones, Edward R: we're going to read.

613
01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:49.140
Jones, Edward R: html, this is a webpage.

614
01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:51.420
Jones, Edward R: This is.

615
01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:57.930
Jones, Edward R: A web page from a newspaper in Lhasa on Mexico it's in English.

616
01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:02.970
Jones, Edward R: But if you take a look at the webpage you can see.

617
01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:05.970
Jones, Edward R: let's say.

618
01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:19.290
Jones, Edward R: If you're if you're the URL for the web pages here, if you want to take a look at it, but basically what they're talking about is you're going to be a tourist and muzzle on how do you get the covert test.

619
01:11:20.250 --> 01:11:30.360
Jones, Edward R: So they set up a system, the hotel South that allow their people that tourists to visit to get a covert test, so they get back in United States fly back and.

620
01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:41.610
Jones, Edward R: i'm sure they're making money on that somebody's making money on that, but at any rate, this is a demonstration of how you process html webpage and so.

621
01:11:42.390 --> 01:12:02.160
Jones, Edward R: What i'm doing here is i've downloaded the webpage as html and it's an html page is to text file and i'm reading that, as you would just an ordinary text file and the only thing that's different here is the type for the document, instead of saying type plain text it's saying type html.

622
01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:05.820
Jones, Edward R: And the encoding type is still ut of eight.

623
01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:16.620
Jones, Edward R: And then, this goes about basically reading the html and assigning the sentiment to that so i'm going to run this oops.

624
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.710
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

625
01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.070
Jones, Edward R: Name contents is not defined.

626
01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:27.360
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

627
01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:34.740
Jones, Edward R: Did it error here yeah there it out oh it doesn't I don't have that file.

628
01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:37.620
Jones, Edward R: In my text area.

629
01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:41.700
Jones, Edward R: So I have to download that as well.

630
01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:48.030
Jones, Edward R: So if I go blaming it we right here.

631
01:12:48.090 --> 01:12:56.190
Fireman, Karen: Saving that file I save as and I gave it that name and I put it in text, and then it seems to not think it's there.

632
01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:57.360
Jones, Edward R: You know, to.

633
01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:06.660
Swanson J, Charles Richard: Karen you can't save it as a text because of html file, you need to right click on it and shape link as.

634
01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:11.220
Swanson J, Charles Richard: And then you'll be able to download it as html file.

635
01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:17.880
Fireman, Karen: Right click it it doesn't give us save link as choice, it just gives us even as choice it's not going to work.

636
01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:18.780
Coleman, Clay: that'll work.

637
01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:23.550
Fireman, Karen: When I tell it to call it that it doesn't listen.

638
01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:26.310
Jones, Edward R: You just go copy here.

639
01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:28.020
Fireman, Karen: Who do you mean.

640
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:30.300
Jones, Edward R: well.

641
01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:31.920
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

642
01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:38.790
Fireman, Karen: I like the name and I tell it the ending period html but it doesn't find it.

643
01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:43.920
Jones, Edward R: yeah i'm having the same problem during because I can right click on this on this pad.

644
01:13:45.390 --> 01:13:47.490
Jones, Edward R: This will get this like white clicking.

645
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:49.410
Jones, Edward R: So.

646
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:51.510
Fireman, Karen: It isn't.

647
01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:52.380
Like all right.

648
01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:01.020
Coleman, Clay: Brian also put it in the chat if you want it, if you scroll up a little bit there's a file that's already saved.

649
01:14:02.130 --> 01:14:02.910
Fireman, Karen: Oh, thank you.

650
01:14:06.330 --> 01:14:06.750
Fireman, Karen: Thank you.

651
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:08.100
Fireman, Karen: Brian.

652
01:14:09.090 --> 01:14:09.240
The.

653
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:11.940
Fireman, Karen: URL that's what it does.

654
01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:15.030
Coleman, Clay: So we now know the name.

655
01:14:15.090 --> 01:14:17.010
Coleman, Clay: Know it's an H well.

656
01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:18.210
Fireman, Karen: This is.

657
01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.730
Coleman, Clay: ya know I say that but it's an html file.

658
01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:25.440
Fireman, Karen: So we changed to you what says URLs html.

659
01:14:28.110 --> 01:14:29.310
Swanson J, Charles Richard: there's another one we just.

660
01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:30.870
Coleman, Clay: yeah there's another one right there.

661
01:14:31.290 --> 01:14:31.530
Fireman, Karen: Okay.

662
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:34.350
Ryan David: I just posted white can grab that one that's an html.

663
01:14:35.190 --> 01:14:37.080
Fireman, Karen: Thank you, sorry that.

664
01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:40.890
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

665
01:14:43.410 --> 01:14:43.770
Jones, Edward R: Thank you.

666
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:46.830
Jones, Edward R: Alright it's now.

667
01:14:48.300 --> 01:15:55.980
Jones, Edward R: 715 let's take a break until 730 and come back at 730.

668
01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:30.510
Fireman, Karen: That they put in their works in the chat it's Karen.

669
01:17:34.170 --> 01:17:37.260
Fireman, Karen: That that file is saved in there for the html it works.

670
01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:00.300
Jones, Edward R: Alright it's.

671
01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:06.390
Jones, Edward R: 730 so let's go ahead and get back on time here.

672
01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:18.120
Jones, Edward R: Just a nerd marine one of the drones here it's got red propellers.

673
01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:34.800
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so one more thing we want to talk about before we get on to the drone so that is classification and so, if you go into into that the nlp folder on the week six you'll see a code labeled.

674
01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:49.350
Jones, Edward R: nlp classified, and this is an example, the classification is more varied thing you can pull out sentences and classify them and classify entire document you can also assign.

675
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:58.320
Jones, Edward R: sentiments to the classification is just pretty pretty unusual things that you can do with this, but we're going to look at the simple thing which is.

676
01:28:58.710 --> 01:29:18.030
Jones, Edward R: How do you take a document, especially a business document and automatically classify so where would this be useful, well, you might remember the Enron trial in Houston where you had these guys were doing some funny things with the energy company in rhyme.

677
01:29:20.310 --> 01:29:21.090
Jones, Edward R: So.

678
01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:22.110
Jones, Edward R: I hope we guys.

679
01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:30.750
Jones, Edward R: Right yeah I hope we're not going to go through one of those again but at any rate the, the bottom line there is that when they went to court.

680
01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:45.300
Jones, Edward R: They the state that had to prove that these people were misusing the funds mismanaging the corporation, and in order to do that, they asked for they wanted to introduce this evidence and the trial.

681
01:29:46.470 --> 01:29:59.460
Jones, Edward R: email about 40,000 email, and it just says no, you can't do that you have to read every single email that is presented as evidence and you have to tell us why you're presenting it so.

682
01:30:00.030 --> 01:30:07.830
Jones, Edward R: What they did was they had some people write a program to go through and read that the actually read the email looking for contact.

683
01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:17.490
Jones, Edward R: And so, this sort of thing about classifying would be very useful if you had to go through thousands of emails looking for the emails that had certain types of content.

684
01:30:18.150 --> 01:30:24.930
Jones, Edward R: And so, this is more or less automatic way to do that it's the sort of thing that Google does well, which is searching.

685
01:30:25.770 --> 01:30:35.340
Jones, Edward R: A search engine right, so this is just a massive search engine on text saying that Okay, are these categories of topics in that in that document.

686
01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:41.220
Jones, Edward R: And then it's going to come back and tell you If REACH document, yes, it will get you a he actually gives you a.

687
01:30:41.730 --> 01:30:49.260
Jones, Edward R: Confidence number between zero and one, the larger the number of the more confident, they are that this is a topic that's in that document.

688
01:30:49.980 --> 01:31:02.850
Jones, Edward R: So we're going to look at how we do that it's it's also using the same package language package and so please download this this little file called Google in LP underscore classified dot P y.

689
01:31:04.350 --> 01:31:15.120
Jones, Edward R: And also, if you could create another folder in your directory called corporations and inside that folder let's download these.

690
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:25.200
Jones, Edward R: three cases, so now, you could have as many documents in this folder as you'd like but we're only using three year, for you know for time purposes, but.

691
01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:45.270
Jones, Edward R: In reality, you would have thousands of documents in here, and one of the things that you might, for example, think about is let's suppose that you want to classify hotel reviews and so you might have so many thousands of those, and this is one way one approach to doing that.

692
01:31:47.010 --> 01:31:59.250
Jones, Edward R: Once you've downloaded that also at the top level put in this file here is called index file, no, no txt know it's Ls or anything like that, just a file called index file.

693
01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:14.880
Jones, Edward R: At the top, this is actually a Python directory if you open it up it's a text file that has a Python directory in it and and it's just abused by the program so i'm going to go ahead and open up the program in LP classify.

694
01:32:16.110 --> 01:32:17.790
Jones, Edward R: And then over here.

695
01:32:18.990 --> 01:32:19.380
Jones, Edward R: and

696
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Jones, Edward R: Do open it up here you'll see there are a lot of functions, we have two of them that look for failure, they should be very familiar to us, they get to text sentiment.

697
01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:50.610
Jones, Edward R: and get text classification we've been using those in the previous program but now we have a bunch more dealing with one here's one called classify so you give it some text and it'll classify the text that's in that document.

698
01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:54.690
Jones, Edward R: And then there's another one here called query.

699
01:32:56.010 --> 01:32:58.830
Jones, Edward R: And this is to query text.

700
01:33:00.630 --> 01:33:01.230
Jones, Edward R: and

701
01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:03.390
Jones, Edward R: This is.

702
01:33:04.410 --> 01:33:12.360
Jones, Edward R: query category, so you can give it a file and ask whether or not a particular category string.

703
01:33:13.230 --> 01:33:29.640
Jones, Edward R: Is in that text now the list of categories that are available from Google are at this URL the list of available labels, the calling them labels or categories is available here at this particular URL and.

704
01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:31.530
Jones, Edward R: I haven't.

705
01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:33.120
Jones, Edward R: Really.

706
01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:39.000
Jones, Edward R: curious to see what that what that looks like.

707
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:42.510
Jones, Edward R: and

708
01:33:46.350 --> 01:33:47.940
Jones, Edward R: see if I can pull this.

709
01:33:49.770 --> 01:33:51.630
Jones, Edward R: Content categories okay.

710
01:33:52.650 --> 01:34:06.750
Jones, Edward R: So you can see, adults this number one category and then arts and entertainment of all sorts music performing arts and autos it's alphabetical so.

711
01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:16.680
Jones, Edward R: This is very just a very general broad lists search list right, so if you're if you're saying i'm going to see, for example, aging.

712
01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:30.360
Jones, Edward R: Healthy aging in geriatrics you know, maybe I want to see if other any particular set of documents contain some opinion on that or discussion of that, then I could launch the specify that we're getting ready to do.

713
01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:33.390
Jones, Edward R: And so.

714
01:34:35.010 --> 01:34:36.600
Jones, Edward R: that's a massive search engine.

715
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:48.180
Jones, Edward R: So we're going to do that what's going to happen there are a bunch of functions up here that that you can explore and might want to try using in your projects, or whatever you want to do.

716
01:34:49.500 --> 01:35:01.080
Jones, Edward R: But we're going to have a directory called corporation, in this case, and what I did was the Alpha vantage has the ability to download the corporate.

717
01:35:02.130 --> 01:35:12.210
Jones, Edward R: For any corporation it's listed download the the description of that corporation, and so we right now in corporate folder corporations, we have three.

718
01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:22.830
Jones, Edward R: descriptions, we have one for IBM, and I think one for alpha Seneca and the other one is I forget the name of it but it's there we'll find out we're going to see that in just a minute.

719
01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:32.190
Jones, Edward R: So when you run this it's going to go into a directory and every document in that directory is going to be classified is going to use this classification engine.

720
01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:40.890
Jones, Edward R: On each one of those files separately, so this is this format is a little different we don't have an excel file where you're looking at each row.

721
01:35:41.370 --> 01:35:53.790
Jones, Edward R: And then that sort of thing we have a directory, and in that directory, we have a collection of you know, documents and we're going through all of that, so let me run this and we'll see what what comes out of that.

722
01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:57.090
Jones, Edward R: and

723
01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:03.090
Jones, Edward R: Let me see i'm trying to.

724
01:36:04.290 --> 01:36:05.730
Jones, Edward R: Get that out of the way again.

725
01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:10.440
Jones, Edward R: Back to zoom.

726
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:13.530
Jones, Edward R: and turn off.

727
01:36:15.450 --> 01:36:17.190
Jones, Edward R: Video panel again.

728
01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:24.600
Jones, Edward R: So, if you look at the output, which is here, there are three files IBM.

729
01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:31.740
Jones, Edward R: API oh it's apple and a CN is alphas zenica I think it's what they pronounce.

730
01:36:32.910 --> 01:36:42.900
Jones, Edward R: So you can see, IBM, of course, it's categories, computers and electronics enterprise technology IQ score of point seven three high score.

731
01:36:43.770 --> 01:36:57.480
Jones, Edward R: And then, a business and industrial business services, a little bit lower score apple consumer and electronics consumer same sort of thing consumer electronics confidence, point six six.

732
01:36:58.170 --> 01:37:07.170
Jones, Edward R: Maybe there's some confusion at their website their in their description and then this is the alpha zenica they're the folks are making the back, one of the vaccines.

733
01:37:07.650 --> 01:37:27.210
Jones, Edward R: And you can see, business and adjustable form of schools sickles in biotech point nine three yes and also help Point six nine or seven, so this is like I say is useful if you have a large collection of documents, and you know you want to go through and classify those documents.

734
01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:29.400
Jones, Edward R: Now.

735
01:37:30.990 --> 01:37:42.540
Jones, Edward R: let's talk about just briefly the assignments, so far, for I may add a little bit to this tomorrow, but if you right now, if you go into week six.

736
01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:46.020
Jones, Edward R: And if you look at.

737
01:37:48.150 --> 01:37:51.030
Jones, Edward R: The week six assignment open this up.

738
01:37:52.410 --> 01:37:59.940
Jones, Edward R: you'll see something that's familiar, this is the homework assignment from week three so you have that code.

739
01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:11.100
Jones, Edward R: And what i'm saying is let's modify it so instead of adjusted close here we're going to make this button and i'm going to make it called replace with narrative.

740
01:38:11.670 --> 01:38:24.780
Jones, Edward R: I just going to call it narrative and so what's going to happen is when you click on that button, instead of getting a graph here you're going to get the description for that company, this will be coming in from alpha vantage.

741
01:38:25.980 --> 01:38:34.560
Jones, Edward R: And so you're going to instead of putting a graph inside of the text area you're just going to put the description of the company, this is easier actually.

742
01:38:35.610 --> 01:38:46.890
Jones, Edward R: Now, the new thing you see this checkbox list here, which is really cool and cute looking we're going to replace that with something called a spin box.

743
01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:57.600
Jones, Edward R: I don't know where that name came from, but if you Google spin box spi n Bo X you'll see that it's a widget in the tk.

744
01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:01.830
Jones, Edward R: version of widgets not in the TT K.

745
01:39:02.850 --> 01:39:10.890
Jones, Edward R: And now, this you're going to see a spin box and just a minute okay i'll show you what one looks like very cool they're very easy to set up.

746
01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:16.710
Jones, Edward R: And you can basically have a list of stuff you click on this list and select the one that you want.

747
01:39:17.340 --> 01:39:28.470
Jones, Edward R: So that's what you'll have here is will have a list of 15 to 20 or more corporations, you can click on any one of those and it will then select that one.

748
01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:36.090
Jones, Edward R: And you will give you if you want the price the closing price, the volume and also the narrative for that company.

749
01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:46.290
Jones, Edward R: And not just the narrative but the category classification for that company, so now, this is going to require more artistic programming.

750
01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:53.520
Jones, Edward R: So you want to have the text that coming out and then at the top, or the bottom, the categories for that company.

751
01:39:54.180 --> 01:40:08.340
Jones, Edward R: So you'd have a category description and then the confidence point 9.8 whatever it is, and usually there are two or three categories for each company, so you want to maybe have some room for that okay.

752
01:40:09.450 --> 01:40:16.200
Jones, Edward R: we'll we can talk more about this during the Q amp a, but I think that's a reason it's going to require you learn something about the.

753
01:40:16.590 --> 01:40:25.140
Jones, Edward R: spin box, which by the way, you're going to see it here in a minute really easy and you're going to have to go back to this APP and and retool it.

754
01:40:25.770 --> 01:40:34.560
Jones, Edward R: Reuse it, so to speak, so I think it's very cool now i'm thinking, maybe you want to add something to this and what what I want to add to the assignment.

755
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:43.230
Jones, Edward R: Is, I would like each of the each of you that are paired with you should at this point be have a partner one or groups of two or three.

756
01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:53.220
Jones, Edward R: And what i'd like to see is i'd like to see a description, and this is be one or one or two, paragraph description it doesn't have to be anything more than one page.

757
01:40:53.940 --> 01:41:00.300
Jones, Edward R: Of what you want to do, for your project for this class now i've already got gotten a couple of responses like that.

758
01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:07.710
Jones, Edward R: And my intention is to use the next two weeks to get caught up on grading and also to.

759
01:41:08.370 --> 01:41:24.630
Jones, Edward R: Look at these look over the descriptions of the projects and give you feedback on that and, but when we get back after the next class well when we get our next class one of the things that we're going to do is we're going to get down to talking about what those projects look like now.

760
01:41:25.890 --> 01:41:34.680
Jones, Edward R: These projects don't have to cure world hunger it's not a cast capstone and I think it's just something you find interesting to do.

761
01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:43.680
Jones, Edward R: I mentioned one of the things today is, you might want to somebody might want to compare the eighth instead of it or other set of us to Google.

762
01:41:44.430 --> 01:41:53.910
Jones, Edward R: and try to understand why the how they're different and why they're different How does Google actually develop the sentiment, I found no documentation on the details.

763
01:41:55.470 --> 01:42:10.440
Jones, Edward R: I can only infer by looking at other stuff that they do, and what I saw that says yeah they were using a neural there's probably a neural network model on this, but the details on the documentation on that I didn't say no that's kind of exists somewhere.

764
01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:17.460
Jones, Edward R: Because if somebody there, by the way, if you use these tools, you have to pay Google money right so.

765
01:42:18.150 --> 01:42:27.810
Jones, Edward R: I would imagine if somebody is using these tools and paying for the sentiment calculations that somebody is told somebody and all of its you want the details go look at document X.

766
01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:46.920
Jones, Edward R: Something like that so um do you think that that exists, so that would be kind of a cool project now other types of projects might be, you know those things of translating text to a voice and so forth, and so on, you might come up with a cool widget that allows kids to learn Spanish.

767
01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:50.310
Jones, Edward R: Through this widget right so.

768
01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:59.310
Jones, Edward R: Some of the things you might do is say the you know the maybe the the the widget speaks to them in Spanish, and then they have to type it in.

769
01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Jones, Edward R: What they think what they think it means, and then the thing actually translates in comparison so forth, and so on.

770
01:43:06.930 --> 01:43:20.640
Jones, Edward R: So it's kind of a, in fact, when I was taking those you know Spanish in school that would have been a cool thing to have it sounds like Okay, I suspect there are Apps like that now, then they they have different ways to do that.

771
01:43:21.690 --> 01:43:22.230
Jones, Edward R: and

772
01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:31.920
Jones, Edward R: You know so things like that, and with some of the other things we've done with the Googles and the end the day advantage.

773
01:43:32.460 --> 01:43:45.690
Jones, Edward R: Of the business analysis, using the off advantage information we've just scratched the surface on that, so you might want to do that, like, for example here and they say homework three you have a time series right.

774
01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:52.560
Jones, Edward R: Now you guys already had a time series class last summer was it or was it the.

775
01:43:53.940 --> 01:44:02.070
Jones, Edward R: fall fall yeah, so this is what is this is this a ar one is this an ar two.

776
01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:04.860
Jones, Edward R: Is this a.

777
01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:11.040
Jones, Edward R: I am i'm a one or something like that, but is this, and so you might.

778
01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:25.980
Jones, Edward R: Allow that kind of investigation with this APP and you might, for example, have there there's a process called auto arena, where people do basically a grid search on different are remodels.

779
01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:41.070
Jones, Edward R: Air one or two and so forth, and so on, and find the best model and then fit it to the data that you could you could do all that right in this area here to showing the the analysis, the results of the analysis, the forecasts and so forth.

780
01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:53.910
Jones, Edward R: That could be pretty and off depending upon how far you're going to take it, I don't expect you're going to do, the whole thing okay.

781
01:44:55.110 --> 01:44:57.330
Jones, Edward R: That would be that would be we're talking months.

782
01:44:58.380 --> 01:45:03.180
Jones, Edward R: To do a really good job on something like that, instead, I would be expecting something like.

783
01:45:04.410 --> 01:45:10.680
Jones, Edward R: Okay i'm going to fit an error one model this and show you the forecast and show you some goodness of fit of that okay.

784
01:45:12.210 --> 01:45:21.690
Jones, Edward R: or they are two or something like that, or maybe maybe you know you click on your sandbox to to tell me what what you want to want you want to you want to three, what do you want.

785
01:45:22.170 --> 01:45:28.500
Jones, Edward R: i'm going to fit the air, water, the two or what have you and then i'm going to give you a measure of goodness of fit.

786
01:45:29.730 --> 01:45:32.700
Jones, Edward R: Based upon that model and.

787
01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:42.150
Jones, Edward R: or it could be something like a Durban Watson statistics that you calculate where you're looking at whether or not it's an error one model fits that puts the data.

788
01:45:43.050 --> 01:45:54.240
Jones, Edward R: You might look at differently, you know, like Okay, if I do a different scene on this series this it right now, is there a trend here is somebody probably not but.

789
01:45:54.960 --> 01:46:00.930
Jones, Edward R: You know if you had a model where you're looking at the trend of some sort you, I want to look at some different seem to see.

790
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:06.030
Jones, Edward R: If I take the first differences does I get rid of that trend and this look like random noise.

791
01:46:06.450 --> 01:46:11.400
Jones, Edward R: You know, one of the first things you do with the time series you look at first and second differences to see.

792
01:46:11.730 --> 01:46:22.170
Jones, Edward R: Whether or not it, it looks like random noise and then you fit that noise to an air or water, what have you so some some fun things here if you're interested in time series that you could be doing.

793
01:46:22.650 --> 01:46:29.790
Jones, Edward R: With this kind of APP now we're going to start talking about drones today, and you could look at doing some Apps on that to.

794
01:46:30.270 --> 01:46:43.050
Jones, Edward R: Some programs on the on on drones so the main thing i'd like to get to with our drone thing is how do you write a program so that the the drone goes over and drops off the package.

795
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:53.130
Jones, Edward R: So you you somebody tells you an address, and you figure out the coordinates and then you go drop off the package, how do you do that.

796
01:46:54.330 --> 01:47:03.660
Jones, Edward R: So you giving you giving the you know the direction and how far it is and that sort of thing now these drones that we're working with here are a little bit limited.

797
01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:15.810
Jones, Edward R: You cannot fly them more than about 100 feet away, otherwise you lose the signal and the they they say they'll go up 200 feet I don't believe it.

798
01:47:17.730 --> 01:47:30.480
Jones, Edward R: I think the reception on these this is limited, so you be aware of that is that you have the you basically have to stay within about 50 to 100 feet of where wherever you are.

799
01:47:32.670 --> 01:47:43.110
Jones, Edward R: And what anyway let's let's go ahead and talk about the drones then, if you can so we're done talking about Python per se well not entirely done.

800
01:47:43.650 --> 01:47:52.290
Jones, Edward R: But we are you know done with talking about natural language processing for tonight and now we're going to switch over and talk about drones so.

801
01:47:53.310 --> 01:47:54.030
Jones, Edward R: hang on here.

802
01:48:09.570 --> 01:48:20.700
Jones, Edward R: Okay, some of you may have already made a purchase a drone some of you may not and there's no requirement to purchase one, but if you have a look at this i'm going to show you what you're going to see.

803
01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:30.450
Jones, Edward R: There are two different kinds of tella drones there's one called the EDU version which is, I think about $25 or $30 more expensive it's about.

804
01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:49.530
Jones, Edward R: 125 for the EDU version and it's about 89 or $90 plus tax for the non EDU version now, this is to show you what it looks like i'm going to open it up here, so it comes in a nice little box and so like protected here and.

805
01:48:50.700 --> 01:49:02.580
Jones, Edward R: The open it up like a like an egg or something and lips upside down turn it around there it is so this is the EDU version i'm not sorry the the non EDU version and.

806
01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:08.970
Jones, Edward R: You can see that it comes a little white miking white anyway and.

807
01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:16.890
Jones, Edward R: What you'll notice is that it has four propellers each of the propellers are guarded by these little little things here now.

808
01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:28.320
Jones, Edward R: One of the things you want to do with this kind of a drone is you want to just turn the propellers gently with your finger whatever make sure they do not hit the guard.

809
01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:36.570
Jones, Edward R: If you try to launch one of these things, and you hear a thud won't that means propeller probably hit the guard.

810
01:49:36.990 --> 01:49:44.760
Jones, Edward R: If you continue to do that you're probably going to raise up about two feet slide turn upside down and in in crash.

811
01:49:45.330 --> 01:49:57.270
Jones, Edward R: Okay, now it turns out, pretty easy to fix that because you can just been these little guards a little bit to get them out of the way but it's just if you crash everybody crashes, by the way.

812
01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:09.960
Jones, Edward R: If you're not crashing and having fun and so you crash, what are we going to do, typically what happens is you hit the wall, it goes it goes flat on the wall and then turns off and.

813
01:50:10.530 --> 01:50:30.210
Jones, Edward R: drops down Okay, no usually 90% of the time there's no damage to the little drunk and there's no damage to your wall or anything like that one of the things you should be aware of is these propellers are turning pretty fast like 1000 rpm or so and they're very thin bladed.

814
01:50:31.410 --> 01:50:40.950
Jones, Edward R: I want to tell you a story, I actually ran one was moving around and read one of these things, and it took off and hit me in the head in the face.

815
01:50:41.670 --> 01:50:51.120
Jones, Edward R: And one of these little blades just a bubbly I it was enough that I was bleeding Okay, and I was thinking boy i'm glad that was not done in my eye.

816
01:50:52.770 --> 01:51:05.100
Jones, Edward R: So if you are wearing a blind these around yourself yourself or other people it's a good idea to wear glasses, if you have them, or at least protect your face at all place you know.

817
01:51:06.450 --> 01:51:10.410
Jones, Edward R: don't do what I did, and if you have pets.

818
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:17.460
Jones, Edward R: lot of dogs and cats are pretty inquisitive tattle think this is a bird and they'll go whoo yeah.

819
01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:22.650
Jones, Edward R: I would probably not have a cat or dog in the same room with this okay.

820
01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:41.130
Jones, Edward R: I have flown in large drones, by the way, outside and around the bottom 100 feet birds get interested and some birds like hawks they'll attack the drone some people have lost drones that way, believe it or not, I mean like what do you think.

821
01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:47.700
Jones, Edward R: But if you think about it for a minute what happens is a drunken stuff about 100 feet and hovers.

822
01:51:48.690 --> 01:52:00.030
Jones, Edward R: that's the same behaviors as a as a predator had the bird Hawk Hawk that stuff and hover said about 100 feet so they're thinking oh I got competition and go check this out right.

823
01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:09.030
Jones, Edward R: So not surprising that sort of thing happens and it's always the big birds, but not is sometimes a flock of birds will come over.

824
01:52:09.480 --> 01:52:17.460
Jones, Edward R: And then the flock will attack the drone like they're trying to force it out of the area, because they don't like hawks right, I mean that's what the.

825
01:52:17.910 --> 01:52:25.440
Jones, Edward R: crowd man, you know how these birds run around in crowds out here that's what that's all about they want to discourage hawks from coming around.

826
01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:27.510
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so.

827
01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:33.120
Jones, Edward R: that's what the the EDU version looks like now.

828
01:52:35.670 --> 01:52:40.980
Jones, Edward R: The i'm sorry that's a non EDU version, this is the new version.

829
01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:45.660
Jones, Edward R: yeah because, in the summer baggage yeah.

830
01:52:47.310 --> 01:52:54.810
Jones, Edward R: The only thing that's different is really it's black instead of white, so you can tell them apart right off the BAT.

831
01:52:55.320 --> 01:53:07.440
Jones, Edward R: But in addition to that it's programmed a little differently and i'll tell you about what how they're different in that way now, in addition to the drone you also get extra propellers which you may find here.

832
01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:15.570
Jones, Edward R: And an accord for charging the battery and you'll come with one drone comes with one battery.

833
01:53:16.650 --> 01:53:24.000
Jones, Edward R: Generally speaking, you want about three batteries i'm sorry yeah about three three batteries this.

834
01:53:25.230 --> 01:53:27.180
Jones, Edward R: Is what I usually go for that's.

835
01:53:28.410 --> 01:53:34.740
Jones, Edward R: Each batteries, you know $20 but in one battery one charge battery lasts about.

836
01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:43.710
Jones, Edward R: 11 minutes that's for this little drone about 11 minutes and then you'll need to recharge it takes about 30 minutes to recharge.

837
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:48.090
Jones, Edward R: So it's not a you know so okay.

838
01:53:48.810 --> 01:54:00.000
Jones, Edward R: What we're going to be doing one battery be sufficient, but you may find yourself getting coffee or something like that it depends on how how many times, you have to try it out different things.

839
01:54:01.980 --> 01:54:03.630
Jones, Edward R: Let me show you what the battery looks like.

840
01:54:04.770 --> 01:54:08.070
Jones, Edward R: Oh, by the way in the ED version, you also have.

841
01:54:09.330 --> 01:54:27.870
Jones, Edward R: pads these are called mission pants and it looks looks they look odd they are and they look a little bit, but each one actually has a number on it, like, for example, this one is the number eight you see that this is the number one so each of these pads.

842
01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:36.570
Jones, Edward R: And by the way, it's there's a different number on each side, so you have four pads a total of eight different possible numbers.

843
01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:47.160
Jones, Edward R: And you can use these to create interesting missions, where you can tell the drone go point pad number three and it'll go over and try to do that.

844
01:54:48.000 --> 01:55:06.390
Jones, Edward R: The EDU drone is the only one that comes with a pad and it's the only one that has that capability to to actually search for these pads everything else is pretty much the same between the EDU and the other the other simpler version, except for one thing.

845
01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:10.410
Jones, Edward R: With EDU version, you can you can.

846
01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:23.400
Jones, Edward R: Do a swarm of programming now I don't know how many of you seen a the latest cool thing you can do instead of fireworks you can have like 1000 drones.

847
01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:32.610
Jones, Edward R: That fly around with lights and then show different things it's amazing if you if you haven't seen one, you should go see one of these it's pretty amazing.

848
01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:42.570
Jones, Edward R: I would love to see mechanically how they actually do that, but they have each drone is on a slightly different frequency looking for a different signal.

849
01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:58.530
Jones, Edward R: And they have a ray of computers and they're talking to the drones and the drones are following go right five feet go left five feet, you know that kind of thing, and so the precision is amazing these drones have only one sensor.

850
01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:06.600
Jones, Edward R: And there are actually two little laser lights at the bottom of the drone they look like little eyes or little glass eyes right.

851
01:56:07.110 --> 01:56:18.300
Jones, Edward R: Those are laser lights that are used to look for the ground, these are basic to almost all copter drones and what they do is.

852
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:36.030
Jones, Edward R: When they're landing they use these on takeoff and landing to determine how fire, they are above the ground so on takeoff it jumps up and hovers at about a half a meter two to three feet and those lights are used to judge, where it is and where it's hovering.

853
01:56:37.230 --> 01:56:43.740
Jones, Edward R: that's called the downward sensor right but they're there they don't do much else.

854
01:56:44.940 --> 01:56:46.050
Jones, Edward R: They help land and take off.

855
01:56:47.190 --> 01:56:51.600
Jones, Edward R: No both both of these drones have that kind of a sensor.

856
01:56:52.710 --> 01:56:57.690
Jones, Edward R: On larger drones they have sensors top bottom.

857
01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:02.610
Jones, Edward R: Left right all the way around and, in fact.

858
01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:09.600
Jones, Edward R: One of the things you're looking for, and as you if you're going to buy a more expensive drone is how many sensors that they have.

859
01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:20.700
Jones, Edward R: And what kind of sensors are they using So these are infrared sensors they also have Lego sensors, which is a different technology that's coming out now, that is a little better than that.

860
01:57:21.210 --> 01:57:39.960
Jones, Edward R: Also, the larger drones use GPS, and so they use GPS to know where they are and where you are, and so they if you say Come on, they know where you are and they can come find you and they do so by you know going up to a high altitude flying over and then coming down generally.

861
01:57:42.690 --> 01:57:46.650
Jones, Edward R: Now these drones this one these also have a camera.

862
01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:55.650
Jones, Edward R: And you can take pictures with this and you can you can also do video with this, and this camera is used as part of its navigation.

863
01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:05.910
Jones, Edward R: So there is some intelligence there's an artificial intelligence been used to look around this and and to use that to determine where you are where it is and.

864
01:58:06.330 --> 01:58:12.090
Jones, Edward R: avoid try this thing doesn't avoid very well, I mean that's a joke it easily runs into anything.

865
01:58:12.990 --> 01:58:28.380
Jones, Edward R: But that's Okay, I mean you have it's basically you want something light and and something that's usable and I mean the cool thing is, we can write a Python program to tell this thing to take off land turn around run around go over here over there, the whole nine yards.

866
01:58:29.490 --> 01:58:43.830
Jones, Edward R: And with the EDU version we can programs forms, so we can program two or three drones to fly simultaneously in coordination with one another, you apparently have that ability to do that.

867
01:58:45.150 --> 01:59:01.590
Jones, Edward R: Now I want to do to do a little bit of this year, the question is how do you fly this thing well, there are a couple of options, the main option we're going to look at ultimately is we're going to use the computer and the computer is going to talk to the drone using bluetooth basically.

868
01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:03.960
Jones, Edward R: And wi fi.

869
01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:18.450
Jones, Edward R: Primarily wi fi so it sends a wi fi signal to the drone and then over that signal it since commands Python commands to the drone and says okay turn around come back you know that kind of thing.

870
01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:32.820
Jones, Edward R: Most drones are they run on the wi fi type signal the same frequency, as you have at home, what does that mean, though well if you're flying it.

871
01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:42.990
Jones, Edward R: You could have a little interference, so these things you'll you'll you'll experiences sometimes you'll be flying this thing around all of a sudden they'll start wandering somewhere.

872
01:59:43.710 --> 01:59:54.150
Jones, Edward R: that's could be because of wi fi interference, so in the office, I have a wi fi connection and Sure enough, you know you get confused.

873
01:59:55.020 --> 02:00:01.170
Jones, Edward R: The other thing that you see is because these are so light that when it gets close to an object, like a wall.

874
02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:11.310
Jones, Edward R: The wind will blow off of that wall come back on the drone and push it away or bring it into the wall, so when you're about one and a half to two feet close to a wall.

875
02:00:12.180 --> 02:00:22.200
Jones, Edward R: You want to watch real flesh slowly what's happening and be prepared to back out because these will tend to be I don't know, for whatever reason, the walls like magnet school.

876
02:00:23.130 --> 02:00:32.490
Jones, Edward R: You know that comes in, like that the same thing can happen with if you're near person were chair, or something like that you can see the drone might actually.

877
02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:42.000
Jones, Edward R: tend to move in that direction or away from that direction, based upon how that will that wind is being you know come around okay so.

878
02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:44.400
Jones, Edward R: let's see here.

879
02:00:59.340 --> 02:01:12.030
Jones, Edward R: So this is the battery the battery looks very small right and the way this works is it goes in the back end right here one end of it is the camera.

880
02:01:12.570 --> 02:01:19.740
Jones, Edward R: And the opposite in this a battery battery goes down the the layer labeling you see the labeling on this goes down.

881
02:01:20.670 --> 02:01:36.030
Jones, Edward R: And the other part, stays up and you'll see that as it goes, and it just clicks click stop like that now once you have it in that position, there is an on and off button on the maybe the right side a little turn that on.

882
02:01:37.380 --> 02:01:45.540
Jones, Edward R: And you'll see some little flashing lights occur, here it goes through a secrets it's checking that system to make sure that it's okay.

883
02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:55.980
Jones, Edward R: And at this point it's pretty harmless it's not running and everything, so you can hang on to it, and then, once it figures out that okay i'm okay it starts flashing yellow real quickly.

884
02:01:56.430 --> 02:02:03.210
Jones, Edward R: Like that then it's ready to take off once you see the yellow flash then it's ready to respond to a command.

885
02:02:03.690 --> 02:02:14.790
Jones, Edward R: If you leave it there long enough it'll go read, which means i'm getting tired of us are you going to do anything or not, and then eventually it'll shut off by itself, if you don't do anything.

886
02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:29.100
Jones, Edward R: You if you're controlling this on the software, you want to look for the yellow the yellow or the quick read and then you can you know directed to take off or land or whatever you want to do.

887
02:02:30.090 --> 02:02:48.600
Jones, Edward R: You can also Should you decide to have some fun and the way you do, that is, you can use your cell phone or your iPad to control this thing you can fly this thing with your iPad or SOFA.

888
02:02:49.740 --> 02:02:52.110
Jones, Edward R: How do you do that well there's an APP.

889
02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:57.960
Jones, Edward R: And it's called a TELCO out so you go to your favorite store.

890
02:03:00.210 --> 02:03:08.700
Jones, Edward R: Online, of course, this is a free APP, by the way, but I want to show you what it looks like here, you probably have already.

891
02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:12.720
Jones, Edward R: There is okay.

892
02:03:14.550 --> 02:03:18.780
Jones, Edward R: Oh, there we go, so this is what when you when you.

893
02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:22.650
Jones, Edward R: jump there is you're like one page ahead.

894
02:03:23.700 --> 02:03:25.770
Jones, Edward R: Okay, this is not supposed to jump there.

895
02:03:31.740 --> 02:03:32.400
Jones, Edward R: Now.

896
02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:36.390
Jones, Edward R: No.

897
02:03:46.410 --> 02:03:51.510
Jones, Edward R: Okay, when you when it starts up maybe if I do it on my phone, you can see it.

898
02:03:55.410 --> 02:04:04.530
Jones, Edward R: So my phone is pretty small that's why I brought the iPad, but they do work, the same it doesn't matter whether you're on the phone you're on a smartphone.

899
02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:21.690
Jones, Edward R: Here it is okay so that's what Oh, why you do, that I didn't want you to do that okay when it first comes up it hasn't black orange looking picture cool.

900
02:04:22.230 --> 02:04:33.840
Jones, Edward R: And then it jumps over to this little screen that says connect I want to connect to somebody I was I did it doesn't see that APP yet this is now you still flashing okay so.

901
02:04:35.070 --> 02:04:53.550
Jones, Edward R: It does see it, you see, when it does connect you disconnected this guy you can see what the camera sees So if I pick it up and move it around i'm actually the cameras on, and so I can see, on my phone what it sees like that.

902
02:04:54.570 --> 02:04:58.500
Jones, Edward R: Now I think what i'm going to try to do is do it early okay.

903
02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:01.680
Jones, Edward R: i'm trying to do it on this guy.

904
02:05:04.980 --> 02:05:05.490
Jones, Edward R: and

905
02:05:21.660 --> 02:05:27.510
Jones, Edward R: i'd rather fly you use this, if I can rather than that because this is a lot larger.

906
02:05:30.060 --> 02:05:30.690
Jones, Edward R: However.

907
02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:59.580
Jones, Edward R: Oh, I know the problem is yeah you have to connect your if you're using a phone or your iPad you have to connect to the drone using wi fi so on apple there is a little wi fi setting and you go into that wi fi setting i'm going to turn it off here and i'm going to go here turn it on.

908
02:06:00.750 --> 02:06:02.640
Jones, Edward R: And i'm going to.

909
02:06:04.410 --> 02:06:23.910
Jones, Edward R: Okay it's on and it's not showing me all of the different networks that are available here one of them says hello, and a number serial number for that guy right there, so you choose you, you know you select hello, and it will then connect with it eventually.

910
02:06:25.530 --> 02:06:30.270
Jones, Edward R: It says unsecured network, yes, Sir it's unsecured and now it's connected.

911
02:06:31.410 --> 02:06:33.360
Jones, Edward R: Now, once it's connected to their.

912
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:36.090
Jones, Edward R: Then you can go to your TELCO APP.

913
02:06:38.220 --> 02:06:45.000
Jones, Edward R: And you should see what the drone sees on your TELCO out in the middle of all the see that.

914
02:06:46.350 --> 02:06:55.200
Jones, Edward R: So you can't see my iPad but that's what's happening here, and you notice it's flashing green.

915
02:06:56.610 --> 02:07:05.130
Jones, Edward R: Green flash means i'm connected and i'm happy i'm working fine Oh, can the yellow flash is it didn't like me handling is picking it up.

916
02:07:05.700 --> 02:07:16.140
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so we're good there now, if you look at the drone you'll see there's an on the upper left hand corner there's an arrow pointing up that's a take off indicator okay.

917
02:07:16.620 --> 02:07:34.260
Jones, Edward R: So we can use to be play punch that it's going to say, do you want to take off, yes or no yeah okay i'm going to do it by countdown 321 up okay so that's the way it works there now when it does take off it doesn't go like scrambling often and.

918
02:07:35.370 --> 02:07:50.400
Jones, Edward R: It just covers with about three feet, from where he was and sits there waiting for you to do something okay now these little round circles that you see on the bottom are used to control forward back up down and so forth, and so on.

919
02:07:52.230 --> 02:07:58.080
Jones, Edward R: It takes a while to get used to this, and what I would suggest you do is.

920
02:07:59.130 --> 02:08:02.490
Jones, Edward R: just focus on the left hand circle for now.

921
02:08:04.230 --> 02:08:08.370
Jones, Edward R: This left hand circle handles up and down and rotate.

922
02:08:09.630 --> 02:08:15.780
Jones, Edward R: And you can see, if you look at the this the logos that are in that left hand circle you'll see an up arrow.

923
02:08:16.290 --> 02:08:26.790
Jones, Edward R: On the top down arrow on the bottom, so that goes up it goes down and then the rotations you can see that it's going to respectfully rotate at whatever wherever it happens to be.

924
02:08:27.690 --> 02:08:41.010
Jones, Edward R: Now, if you want to land this apparel here in reverses direction once it takes off you hit it again and then it'll land wherever it is so you want to make sure that.

925
02:08:42.090 --> 02:08:50.370
Jones, Edward R: You know it's someplace flat it's going to land, so what i'm going to do, then, is i'm going to put this on the ground.

926
02:08:54.510 --> 02:08:55.200
Jones, Edward R: like that.

927
02:08:56.730 --> 02:09:06.780
Jones, Edward R: That way when it takes off and I hit land it's going to come back down about that position so i'm going to hit take off and it says, you really want to do that i'm going to say yes.

928
02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:09.330
Jones, Edward R: And there you go so okay.

929
02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:12.180
Fireman, Karen: where's the button.

930
02:09:13.890 --> 02:09:14.220
Fireman, Karen: where's the.

931
02:09:16.020 --> 02:09:30.150
Jones, Edward R: button, be careful here you got glasses okay good So you see our suffering there right it's not going anywhere now you see this little circle i'm going to hit the up arrow.

932
02:09:32.220 --> 02:09:32.640
well.

933
02:09:34.470 --> 02:09:34.950
Jones, Edward R: There you go.

934
02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:36.240
Jones, Edward R: This.

935
02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:46.680
Jones, Edward R: Making funny noise that's coming into the microphone.

936
02:09:53.250 --> 02:09:54.690
Jones, Edward R: I hope it's not too annoying.

937
02:09:56.640 --> 02:09:58.590
Jones, Edward R: Alright, so let's rotate.

938
02:09:59.700 --> 02:10:01.080
Fireman, Karen: let's hit this round.

939
02:10:01.170 --> 02:10:02.820
Jones, Edward R: On the on the left hand side.

940
02:10:04.590 --> 02:10:06.000
Jones, Edward R: You just hold it down.

941
02:10:07.590 --> 02:10:10.050
Jones, Edward R: And you see it through okay now 360.

942
02:10:11.250 --> 02:10:15.780
Jones, Edward R: like that, and if I want to run the other direction, I think the other circle.

943
02:10:17.070 --> 02:10:17.790
Jones, Edward R: and pull it.

944
02:10:19.170 --> 02:10:19.980
Jones, Edward R: out like that.

945
02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:23.880
Jones, Edward R: Right push it down and pull it out.

946
02:10:26.340 --> 02:10:27.000
Jones, Edward R: The Hello.

947
02:10:30.210 --> 02:10:30.840
Okay.

948
02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:37.320
Jones, Edward R: Okay, now, if you look on your screen.

949
02:10:38.700 --> 02:10:52.170
Jones, Edward R: You should see a battery up here in the top and right now it's showing that the battery is pretty cool so we're cool cool, by the way, when you get down about 20% of your full battery it's going to land.

950
02:10:53.250 --> 02:10:57.630
Jones, Edward R: it'll say i'm done i've worked enough that's it land.

951
02:11:01.170 --> 02:11:17.790
Jones, Edward R: it's tell you also in the top how strong the wi fi signal is, you see the little wi fi signals okay that's that's going to show you if you get too far you're going to start losing that signal, so you want to watch that and now if I want to take a picture.

952
02:11:18.900 --> 02:11:19.410
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

953
02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:26.010
Jones, Edward R: Let me turn it, let me turn this around so let's take a picture of here we go.

954
02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:30.030
Jones, Edward R: yeah I got it I got you guys all right.

955
02:11:31.110 --> 02:11:37.230
Jones, Edward R: The movie a little bit here all right, take a picture you hit the little white circle up the right hand corner.

956
02:11:38.610 --> 02:11:39.960
Jones, Edward R: And I just took your picture.

957
02:11:41.340 --> 02:11:43.680
Jones, Edward R: let's take another one for good luck and.

958
02:11:44.940 --> 02:11:46.560
Jones, Edward R: let's turn over here and.

959
02:11:47.580 --> 02:11:48.540
Jones, Edward R: there's janie.

960
02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:54.210
Jones, Edward R: Take your picture yeah I got that.

961
02:11:55.890 --> 02:11:56.460
Jones, Edward R: All right.

962
02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:09.120
Jones, Edward R: And now i'm going to change this circle to read, if you push the little camera next to the circle it changed from the photograph mode to the video mode.

963
02:12:09.930 --> 02:12:21.930
Jones, Edward R: And that the circle is red and I press press it like that it's the video is now recording so now it's actually recording the video and whatever I move this or turn this around.

964
02:12:24.300 --> 02:12:25.980
Jones, Edward R: There we go yeah.

965
02:12:27.090 --> 02:12:27.600
Jones, Edward R: So.

966
02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:45.450
Jones, Edward R: We go by you're getting look differently, you know they go back up and she just sits there pretty steady in here in my office it jumps around a lot, because the room is small, so if you're doing this in a small room and don't expect that kind of behavior this is pretty cool.

967
02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:53.190
Jones, Edward R: This is what safer environment than running a little office customer on that so very nice.

968
02:12:54.420 --> 02:13:03.270
Jones, Edward R: And we're gonna have we're gonna have some fun here with it, so now i'm going to say land so i'm going to push the upper left hand board button, which is the air down arrow.

969
02:13:03.690 --> 02:13:14.760
Jones, Edward R: And i'm going to push it once click at once, and it says tap the land or land in your hand, you can have a training to land in your hand i'm going to just say go to the ground.

970
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:18.990
Jones, Edward R: So they are typically once and now who.

971
02:13:20.130 --> 02:13:38.640
Jones, Edward R: knows it's there we go, so how did they do the landing and use those little sensors sensors that so one of the things they tell you is don't fly at night, because you can see the floor and the sensors don't work if it's not enough light in the room, so be aware of that okay.

972
02:13:40.470 --> 02:13:47.370
Jones, Edward R: So this is one option, you can use an iPad I think the cool nice thing about this option is, you have a pretty good picture.

973
02:13:47.850 --> 02:13:55.770
Jones, Edward R: of whatever the drone is saved, so you can actually you're not supposed to do this, but you can fly this and other drones without.

974
02:13:56.250 --> 02:14:02.190
Jones, Edward R: Without actually being with them, you know you can fly them into another room and see what they're seeing and then bring it back now.

975
02:14:02.610 --> 02:14:20.370
Jones, Edward R: This little guy because the reception is very good that's not recommended, but for other drones you, you are, you can do that, but people do that, but your people are cautious, not to do that so okay this guy will go up to about so Paul so caught up to about 100 feet.

976
02:14:22.650 --> 02:14:23.130
Jones, Edward R: yeah.

977
02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:39.420
Jones, Edward R: they're not be windy might might lose the drone if you go up that high winton's to get more go up as you go up now, we have this on wi fi so i'm going to stop the wi fi here.

978
02:14:41.190 --> 02:15:01.500
Jones, Edward R: disconnect basically so now, you see it's all you can't see it but it's flashing yellow instead of brain so yeah so you can use a smartphone you can use iPad you can also buy little joysticks i'll show you some time with those look like to do this as well and.

979
02:15:02.940 --> 02:15:04.860
Jones, Edward R: I have a bunch of batteries here but.

980
02:15:06.300 --> 02:15:07.110
Jones, Edward R: Oh yeah.

981
02:15:09.060 --> 02:15:18.630
Jones, Edward R: This is really cool because one of the things that's nice about the joysticks is you can actually put your your your smartphone inside here.

982
02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:28.800
Jones, Edward R: So you can see right here what's happening with your drone and then you can use these little sticks to maneuver it left, right up down and that sort of thing.

983
02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:46.410
Jones, Edward R: And these drones are actually and you can also little trigger things to turn the camera on and off it's very cool and the other thing you can do is flip with causes thing to flow okay index does some has some of that kind of capability okay um.

984
02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:48.720
Jones, Edward R: let's see.

985
02:15:50.550 --> 02:16:00.840
Jones, Edward R: All right, at this point I just wondering, are there any questions about the basic operation of this this thing or safety or.

986
02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:07.410
Jones, Edward R: Some of you probably already fund the sky I got that feeling.

987
02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:21.270
Fireman, Karen: Yes, Karen I tried and it didn't it didn't connect to the wi fi the way you said, and then it asks did I wanted to use cellular so I said yes and that did work but shouldn't have worked with the wi fi didn't.

988
02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:24.420
Jones, Edward R: What did you use.

989
02:16:25.260 --> 02:16:36.870
Fireman, Karen: I did the Teller one like you said I went to the wi fi and I solid tell him I clicked on that when I went back and didn't seem to like it, but it said, do you want to sell her so I said sure are you sorry it was going up and down i've been a big room was it was awful.

990
02:16:37.740 --> 02:16:38.940
Jones, Edward R: i'm not sure what that.

991
02:16:38.940 --> 02:16:41.520
Jones, Edward R: Is your are you on an android.

992
02:16:43.410 --> 02:16:45.240
Fireman, Karen: I know it's a it's a it's an.

993
02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:46.380
iPhone.

994
02:16:48.540 --> 02:16:48.840
yeah.

995
02:16:50.220 --> 02:16:53.850
Jones, Edward R: I don't know but it's good to me if you got it okay it's fine.

996
02:16:54.390 --> 02:16:54.720
Fireman, Karen: It works.

997
02:16:55.230 --> 02:16:58.440
Jones, Edward R: yeah yeah somehow a you're talking wi fi though I.

998
02:16:58.440 --> 02:17:02.190
Jones, Edward R: mean that's the only frequency the sky really response on.

999
02:17:04.170 --> 02:17:06.510
Jones, Edward R: For us just turned itself off it's good.

1000
02:17:07.770 --> 02:17:18.150
Jones, Edward R: let's see so no other no questions at this point, all right okay fine now let's go to talking about programming with the oh no, no, no, no, no.

1001
02:17:18.750 --> 02:17:32.490
Jones, Edward R: Oh yeah let's go back to week number six and, if you look here, where it says Hello tools there's a folder called tello tools, if you look at this, there are I I downloaded the manuals and.

1002
02:17:33.900 --> 02:17:48.090
Jones, Edward R: They are they're not in that folder I couldn't get them in that folder SDK 1.3 SDK 2.0 EDU manual and the there's a manual on the pad submission paths okay.

1003
02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:55.980
Jones, Edward R: These are the four basic PDF files that are available for download some of you may have already got Nice.

1004
02:17:56.550 --> 02:18:13.170
Jones, Edward R: Let me just briefly describe what these are SDK 1.3 is SDK sense for software development kit So this is the library or the API that is used to communicate with the drone 1.3 was the first.

1005
02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:25.140
Jones, Edward R: kit that really came out and that version of API works with the non EDU drone.

1006
02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:38.250
Jones, Edward R: And then the 2.0 came out to work with the EDU drones so what you'll see is that two point O contains all of the commands that are available in 1.3.

1007
02:18:38.940 --> 02:18:56.370
Jones, Edward R: plus a few more that are not available in 1.3 and so this is describes technically the difference between the EDU drone and the non EDU drum the non EDU drone the white one will only respond to commands from 1.3.

1008
02:18:58.260 --> 02:19:01.620
Jones, Edward R: EDU drone will respond to commands from 2.0.

1009
02:19:03.060 --> 02:19:06.450
Jones, Edward R: There they are very, very similar or like.

1010
02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:19.260
Jones, Edward R: Certainly, the basic commands are alike, and they are only different and some of the things like mission, the mission pad commands and a few other commands that EDU response to it.

1011
02:19:20.250 --> 02:19:30.900
Jones, Edward R: Then there's a technical manual EDU manual that talks about the physical characteristics of the drone and this actually applies to both drones not just the EDU drunk.

1012
02:19:31.590 --> 02:19:40.410
Jones, Edward R: physically, there are no different there are no obvious differences physically it's all the all the difference of the drones is in the software, also the only the software.

1013
02:19:42.420 --> 02:19:53.700
Jones, Edward R: By the way, when you power everyone every once while you are a power it up using your smartphone or your iPad to make sure that there's no an update on firm was called firmware update.

1014
02:19:54.300 --> 02:20:05.250
Jones, Edward R: And so, when it happens, you want to connect to your drone and then you can go through the APP to download the update and then install it in in the drone itself.

1015
02:20:05.790 --> 02:20:13.920
Jones, Edward R: So the drone is like a little computer there is software in there and it is there is a version number and you want to update that when you have an update.

1016
02:20:15.540 --> 02:20:25.950
Jones, Edward R: The EDU manual I think talks a little bit about that the mission pads that that's just a brief discussion of what those paths look like and how they can be used.

1017
02:20:26.850 --> 02:20:36.780
Jones, Edward R: And then there is a file here called tell them basic that P, why i'd like you to download that and we're going to open that up in spider now.

1018
02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:50.490
Jones, Edward R: First of all, you're probably going to I have to do this, I have to get out of spider I have to shut it down because I have two different kinds of environments that i've created, I have a Google environment.

1019
02:20:51.510 --> 02:21:06.120
Jones, Edward R: And then, I have a drone environment so they're the the libraries for the drone are not installed in the Google environment and i'm going to install them or i'm going to open up spider after I change the environment.

1020
02:21:07.260 --> 02:21:09.630
Jones, Edward R: To the drone.

1021
02:21:10.830 --> 02:21:13.080
Jones, Edward R: So if I go here into into.

1022
02:21:14.250 --> 02:21:31.950
Jones, Edward R: anaconda you see right now, the environment is that i'm set up to use this label drone and if I change that to sorry it's labeled Google now i'm going to change it to drone and see what happens here, it should change environments for me.

1023
02:21:34.470 --> 02:21:48.930
Jones, Edward R: Sometimes this doesn't work well, sometimes the environment doesn't change over, and I have to actually shut down anaconda and restart anaconda and then select the the environment that I want and i'm not sure.

1024
02:21:50.370 --> 02:21:54.240
Jones, Edward R: Jamie do you happen to know why that might be the case, why.

1025
02:21:55.620 --> 02:21:57.360
Jones, Edward R: Have you have you run into that.

1026
02:22:00.240 --> 02:22:01.800
Jones, Edward R: yeah no.

1027
02:22:04.830 --> 02:22:05.340
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

1028
02:22:08.550 --> 02:22:11.700
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so i've changed over to the drone environment here.

1029
02:22:13.980 --> 02:22:31.260
Jones, Edward R: The difference is that in the drone environment, I have this installed the easy tello library, and this is a pip install you want to say pip install easy tell him he as y te Hello so i'm going to launch that.

1030
02:22:32.490 --> 02:22:36.420
Jones, Edward R: That environment right now with the spider is launch under that environment.

1031
02:22:40.290 --> 02:22:41.340
Jones, Edward R: And i'll show you.

1032
02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:45.090
Jones, Edward R: When we do the condo list what that looks like.

1033
02:22:52.020 --> 02:22:52.500
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

1034
02:23:01.290 --> 02:23:03.840
Jones, Edward R: So, right now, you can see it's all of the Google.

1035
02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:10.620
Jones, Edward R: programs, who were working on earlier coming up i'm going to shut them down so that.

1036
02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:16.200
Jones, Edward R: keeps trying to sell me spider 4.2 or something.

1037
02:23:19.140 --> 02:23:19.560
Jones, Edward R: yeah.

1038
02:23:28.620 --> 02:23:29.700
Jones, Edward R: writing.

1039
02:23:31.770 --> 02:23:35.880
Jones, Edward R: Now what i'm going to do is download tell a basic P, why.

1040
02:23:36.930 --> 02:23:38.460
Jones, Edward R: From the week six folder.

1041
02:23:39.630 --> 02:23:43.500
Jones, Edward R: And i'm going to put that in into the area that and then using.

1042
02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:53.130
Jones, Edward R: OK.

1043
02:23:55.620 --> 02:23:56.280
Jones, Edward R: and

1044
02:23:58.140 --> 02:24:04.890
Jones, Edward R: Now I have to move it out of the download the area, I believe it and to where it is.

1045
02:24:06.270 --> 02:24:08.790
Jones, Edward R: And i'm going to copy and paste that.

1046
02:24:10.290 --> 02:24:12.870
Jones, Edward R: into my folder.

1047
02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:29.160
Jones, Edward R: Okay, apparently, I have an older version.

1048
02:24:30.660 --> 02:24:32.520
Jones, Edward R: We make sure that happened right.

1049
02:24:38.010 --> 02:24:42.930
Jones, Edward R: yeah okay looking good so i'm going to open that up and spider now.

1050
02:24:45.150 --> 02:24:50.910
Jones, Edward R: Before I do that, though let's let's do one thing here let's go Condor list.

1051
02:24:52.350 --> 02:24:55.500
Jones, Edward R: and see what i'm talking about the library.

1052
02:24:59.580 --> 02:25:02.010
Jones, Edward R: And so there's a package.

1053
02:25:03.390 --> 02:25:05.490
Jones, Edward R: And it's called easy tello.

1054
02:25:07.350 --> 02:25:08.130
Jones, Edward R: EA.

1055
02:25:10.500 --> 02:25:11.460
Jones, Edward R: T shirts here.

1056
02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:36.690
Jones, Edward R: rate they're easy to follow and it's showing up as version 0.0 Point seven Now you can go to the github for the easy tello and you'll see that easy tello is a simple set of code, there are two major files one called stats stats dot P y and the other one called.

1057
02:25:38.790 --> 02:25:47.280
Jones, Edward R: And you can read the code and see and learn a lot about what this package is doing and not doing it doesn't do everything.

1058
02:25:48.210 --> 02:25:56.220
Jones, Edward R: But it does the basics to get that sort of thing so we're going to be doing now to install this package, I think I just used.

1059
02:25:56.940 --> 02:26:07.890
Jones, Edward R: I don't believe a con to kinda installed didn't work, this is one of those pip easy to Hello pip install easy to be sure you're in the environment wanna you operate in.

1060
02:26:08.820 --> 02:26:16.590
Jones, Edward R: You can put it in with the Google stuff I decided just to separate the two, but you know you might want to put them together, I don't this matter here.

1061
02:26:17.100 --> 02:26:18.390
Jones, Edward R: That you're trying to work.

1062
02:26:20.310 --> 02:26:20.610
Jones, Edward R: But.

1063
02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:23.880
Fireman, Karen: I tried to do that it didn't work so it's.

1064
02:26:25.350 --> 02:26:28.260
Jones, Edward R: No, it didn't work didn't like you didn't like the Google stuff.

1065
02:26:30.180 --> 02:26:32.460
Fireman, Karen: i'm not sure i'm starting a new one now yeah.

1066
02:26:32.520 --> 02:26:38.310
Jones, Edward R: yeah well, it could be and whoa I know what it is, oh there's one other thing that's you definitely have to install.

1067
02:26:39.840 --> 02:26:43.110
Jones, Edward R: And that is open CV down here.

1068
02:26:45.240 --> 02:26:47.100
Jones, Edward R: it's you'll see.

1069
02:26:48.720 --> 02:26:51.360
Jones, Edward R: it's MP, an open.

1070
02:26:54.330 --> 02:26:57.600
Jones, Edward R: open air, it is open CV.

1071
02:26:58.620 --> 02:27:13.560
Jones, Edward R: is right here, it says open CV dash Python this is, I believe you this is a condo install I think you can go Connor install open CV, and that is a package that is used for video analysis.

1072
02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:24.480
Jones, Edward R: that's why it's theirs, because you want to capture video off of a drone your CV package is the most likely one to use open CV dash Python.

1073
02:27:25.500 --> 02:27:38.940
Jones, Edward R: This is it says on the right hand side, it says P, why API, which means that the I was wrong it didn't economy install it's not going to work there you're going to have to pip pip install open CV, I believe, but.

1074
02:27:40.500 --> 02:27:48.090
Jones, Edward R: That needs to be there as well, and I think that's a little bit of a conflict with some of the other Google stuff we were doing but I don't i'm not sure.

1075
02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:56.730
Jones, Edward R: You could could run into a problem there but OK, so we were going to open up the.

1076
02:28:00.390 --> 02:28:04.350
Jones, Edward R: That program that I just mentioned and.

1077
02:28:05.730 --> 02:28:07.080
Jones, Edward R: it's called.

1078
02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:09.420
Jones, Edward R: tello.

1079
02:28:11.910 --> 02:28:13.770
Jones, Edward R: Basic dot P, why.

1080
02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:29.970
Jones, Edward R: Only it's not that basic the started this started out as a basic project, but it turns out that it a bit more than basic now Okay, so this code that you're looking at how many lines.

1081
02:28:31.740 --> 02:28:34.080
Jones, Edward R: 541 lines okay.

1082
02:28:35.190 --> 02:28:46.620
Jones, Edward R: So for the next two weeks, if you want to have some fun take a look at this code and you'll learn that on using a lot of spin boxes here now i'm not sure let's see.

1083
02:28:49.860 --> 02:28:50.820
Jones, Edward R: If crank this up.

1084
02:28:52.830 --> 02:28:54.990
Jones, Edward R: And we're going to see.

1085
02:28:56.910 --> 02:28:59.190
Jones, Edward R: me whether I have everything installed here.

1086
02:29:00.480 --> 02:29:02.520
Jones, Edward R: Okay, there is a problem.

1087
02:29:03.990 --> 02:29:04.470
Jones, Edward R: going on.

1088
02:29:10.740 --> 02:29:15.840
Jones, Edward R: Oh, I need to create the directory drone underscore I n g.

1089
02:29:19.410 --> 02:29:20.820
Jones, Edward R: OK so.

1090
02:29:21.930 --> 02:29:24.090
Jones, Edward R: i'm going to close this down for a minute.

1091
02:29:25.440 --> 02:29:29.880
Jones, Edward R: And this is where i'm, this is the directory i'm using so i'm going to.

1092
02:29:30.930 --> 02:29:32.490
Jones, Edward R: file new folder.

1093
02:29:34.500 --> 02:29:37.290
Jones, Edward R: And what was it called drone image.

1094
02:29:39.120 --> 02:29:40.590
Jones, Edward R: On the score IMG.

1095
02:29:42.420 --> 02:29:44.700
Jones, Edward R: I think that's the name of the directory.

1096
02:29:46.830 --> 02:29:59.760
Jones, Edward R: drone underscore IMG, and this is basically a directory, I think that it's been used to store, the images that it creates images and so forth, let me see if that's if that's going to work now.

1097
02:30:00.990 --> 02:30:01.740
Jones, Edward R: It says.

1098
02:30:03.330 --> 02:30:07.350
Jones, Edward R: No such file or directory drone underscore I am g.

1099
02:30:09.030 --> 02:30:12.480
Jones, Edward R: And so i'm going to start.

1100
02:30:25.710 --> 02:30:28.650
Faculty Office Hours: hey Dr Jones is looking for the images for you.

1101
02:30:28.860 --> 02:30:30.390
Jones, Edward R: Know it's looking for this image.

1102
02:30:30.390 --> 02:30:35.730
Jones, Edward R: In a yeah there's a there is an image that I use in this gooey.

1103
02:30:36.900 --> 02:30:44.040
Jones, Edward R: That I forgot to upload okay what line is this that 20 no.

1104
02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:48.420
Jones, Edward R: It looks like it's right here.

1105
02:30:52.500 --> 02:30:53.610
Jones, Edward R: line at one.

1106
02:30:57.990 --> 02:30:59.370
Jones, Edward R: i'll get you this image.

1107
02:31:00.540 --> 02:31:06.300
Jones, Edward R: When I get home but it's someone other computer obviously so line at one.

1108
02:31:10.200 --> 02:31:11.070
Jones, Edward R: Oh wait a minute.

1109
02:31:12.870 --> 02:31:14.820
Jones, Edward R: All of these images that's right.

1110
02:31:15.450 --> 02:31:21.090
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so we're not going to be able to run this until I get all those images in there.

1111
02:31:25.830 --> 02:31:28.320
Jones, Edward R: yeah yeah wait a minute.

1112
02:31:30.330 --> 02:31:36.150
Jones, Edward R: Did I miss I can't believe I missed that up but it's possible okay.

1113
02:31:43.410 --> 02:31:49.770
Jones, Edward R: So you need that directory, but I need a bunch of I use a lot of graphics inside inside of this gooey.

1114
02:31:51.480 --> 02:31:52.140
Jones, Edward R: and

1115
02:31:57.930 --> 02:32:00.120
Jones, Edward R: looks like they're not on this computer.

1116
02:32:03.330 --> 02:32:03.870
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

1117
02:32:05.580 --> 02:32:07.560
Jones, Edward R: Let me, let me double check over here.

1118
02:32:28.350 --> 02:32:33.270
Jones, Edward R: nope it's that's no that's that's too bad okay.

1119
02:32:34.800 --> 02:32:41.790
Jones, Edward R: I will, I will bring those I will put those up on the week six folder tonight when I get back.

1120
02:32:43.290 --> 02:32:55.170
Jones, Edward R: yeah in order to use this this gooey you'll you'll see what I get I actually created a bunch of images and so the circles that you saw on the APP.

1121
02:32:55.680 --> 02:33:06.900
Jones, Edward R: I have a circle, I have two circles and two circles and then inside those circles, I have little icons that represent up down left or right, you know that sort of thing.

1122
02:33:08.220 --> 02:33:19.590
Jones, Edward R: you'll see let's just take a look here for a second at what this is going to look like, so if I if you go here to line, let me make this larger.

1123
02:33:22.620 --> 02:33:25.650
Jones, Edward R: Okay, if you go to line number 80.

1124
02:33:28.860 --> 02:33:44.160
Jones, Edward R: you'll see it says new size 50 comma 100 i'm taking an image, the image is called take off the PNG it's a PNG image and it's it's actually a little circle, with an arrow similar to what you saw on the Tele.

1125
02:33:45.480 --> 02:33:52.560
Jones, Edward R: And i'm resizing it, I mean it's very difficult to get exactly the right size, you want, so this.

1126
02:33:53.430 --> 02:34:04.260
Jones, Edward R: set of instructions you just see is typically what you do if you want to resize an image and then use it in the gooey or somewhere else, maybe a web page or something like that.

1127
02:34:04.770 --> 02:34:15.840
Jones, Edward R: Now, if you look at the the intro import things you see it says import from ppl import image tk and image now.

1128
02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:26.790
Jones, Edward R: This may or may not require an install I can't I can't recall a PL is the is we've used us in the best it's the it's the photo image library.

1129
02:34:27.960 --> 02:34:33.450
Jones, Edward R: And it's used to manipulate images, you know photographs and also video.

1130
02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:40.050
Jones, Edward R: So we're important image tk for the gooey and then image.

1131
02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:43.380
Jones, Edward R: And if we go back to line number at.

1132
02:34:46.140 --> 02:34:48.060
Jones, Edward R: lipson little bit too far, there.

1133
02:34:49.140 --> 02:35:02.580
Jones, Edward R: you'll see that I want i'm taking the end of the the raw image and i'm resizing it is 50 a with the 50 pixels and a height of 100 so in in the tinker.

1134
02:35:03.210 --> 02:35:12.330
Jones, Edward R: Though it's always with pipe with tight with this, the first number height is the second number, and these are pixels, and so it says image open.

1135
02:35:12.900 --> 02:35:28.200
Jones, Edward R: image path, and so this is just showing you where that image should be it's not there, and you image, a year you're opening that image and placing it into a variable called off image meaning of land that take off.

1136
02:35:29.310 --> 02:35:31.770
Jones, Edward R: And then we're resizing to the.

1137
02:35:34.530 --> 02:35:42.510
Jones, Edward R: And then we use the image tk photo image to actually create a photo image.

1138
02:35:43.650 --> 02:35:50.100
Jones, Edward R: object that is required by to tinker to be if you're going to use it as a button.

1139
02:35:51.210 --> 02:36:08.730
Jones, Edward R: So you can't just take any image like a jar file or PNG file and use it as a tinker, but you have to go through this this gymnastics that you see here, you have to get it to the right size and then you have to create a photo image object from image tk.

1140
02:36:10.020 --> 02:36:17.370
Jones, Edward R: And then, once you do that, you can see, the next one, it says tk button not TT K tk button.

1141
02:36:18.510 --> 02:36:22.680
Jones, Edward R: And because the tk button lets you use images to represent the button.

1142
02:36:24.150 --> 02:36:40.230
Jones, Edward R: So you can with the tk widget you can make a button of any size or shape basically by jury getting an image shaping it and then saying okay here's my image object and and set that setting the image here equal to that object.

1143
02:36:41.610 --> 02:36:45.300
Jones, Edward R: And then your tk button it's going into the top left frame.

1144
02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:49.320
Jones, Edward R: And then the command if this is pressed take off.

1145
02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:52.740
Jones, Edward R: there's a function down below called take off.

1146
02:36:53.820 --> 02:36:58.320
Jones, Edward R: And then you have the width and the height of the button 5100 the same thing as a resize.

1147
02:36:59.340 --> 02:36:59.610
Jones, Edward R: them.

1148
02:37:00.780 --> 02:37:18.270
Jones, Edward R: And then the next one i'm doing the land button right here the land button, the same structure, I bring in the file that contains the photo the picture simple picture and then I resize it and I make it that and I associate that with the land.

1149
02:37:20.130 --> 02:37:21.600
Jones, Edward R: Okay, with me on this.

1150
02:37:22.650 --> 02:37:32.790
Jones, Edward R: All right, let's go down below where these functions take off and land or and take it as you see what happens here, so this is all good stuff and then.

1151
02:37:34.200 --> 02:37:35.670
Jones, Edward R: Then here are the functions.

1152
02:37:37.830 --> 02:37:40.260
Jones, Edward R: here's take off and here's land okay.

1153
02:37:41.790 --> 02:38:02.130
Jones, Edward R: let's talk about land versus South smaller land, it says if self dot fly is true so there's this variable called fly, which is true if it's off the ground and false if it's down on the ground at least it's supposed to be that way if it crashes, it may still think it's flying.

1154
02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:05.400
Jones, Edward R: that's the problem so.

1155
02:38:06.780 --> 02:38:08.340
Jones, Edward R: So again, the I just print on the.

1156
02:38:09.420 --> 02:38:18.870
Jones, Edward R: Python window land and then the command is from easy, this is an easy tello command drone land that pretty easy right.

1157
02:38:19.440 --> 02:38:39.990
Jones, Edward R: so easy tello gives you these kind of commands that you could that will automatically go out to the drone drone dot lands now, it turns out that each before you can start giving the commands to the drone you have to issue a connect message and that's a simple command command.

1158
02:38:41.280 --> 02:38:50.490
Jones, Edward R: And if you if you issue that that message command the drone should turn to green the little light on the front of the drone show turned to green if it doesn't.

1159
02:38:50.910 --> 02:39:02.700
Jones, Edward R: Then it did not connect and you have to restart basically and sometimes have to do two or three restarts, and each time you restart you have to restart the Colonel.

1160
02:39:03.990 --> 02:39:18.900
Jones, Edward R: A who you can't just restart you have to restart the colonel, and the reason for that is because, when you're doing this sort of thing the Colonel the approved the computer actually links up to the drone on a radio frequency.

1161
02:39:19.980 --> 02:39:29.730
Jones, Edward R: And when you stop the program the drum thinks that link is still still listening for that signal, I know you're out there somewhere i'm just waiting i'm just waiting.

1162
02:39:30.900 --> 02:39:50.790
Jones, Edward R: So you can't just kill the program because that does not kill the link the little drone is still waiting to hear something right, so you have to restart the kernel which completely drops that link Okay, the the connection the wi fi connection will be dropped, no more restart.

1163
02:39:51.990 --> 02:40:01.950
Jones, Edward R: So that's why you have to go through that business is because of that that wi fi connection now, if you look at the tape the tape off it's a little more complicated.

1164
02:40:03.270 --> 02:40:03.810
Jones, Edward R: Because.

1165
02:40:05.370 --> 02:40:12.360
Jones, Edward R: The crash phenomenon you land, but it didn't didn't really reset The fly button, so I checked the height.

1166
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:26.370
Jones, Edward R: So I say drone dot get hype that's another easy telecom man, and that will give you that will tell you how high it is off the off of the area that it took off from it should be zero if it's on the ground.

1167
02:40:27.930 --> 02:40:43.620
Jones, Edward R: And it could actually be negative, if you take off on a table and then lamb that over on the ground, or something like that it could be negative, but obviously if it's zero or less it's not flying so you're checking there is if the height is less than one.

1168
02:40:44.820 --> 02:40:49.980
Jones, Edward R: Then the fly should be false and then you check them to see as the power on.

1169
02:40:51.570 --> 02:41:02.220
Jones, Edward R: Which means is, are we connected, we got power, the power really means that the bike bicycle is connected, we got a green flash on the on the drone and then you just set.

1170
02:41:03.390 --> 02:41:05.430
Jones, Edward R: Fire to true and.

1171
02:41:07.350 --> 02:41:17.550
Jones, Edward R: The command is actually your drone takeoff is the AC DC telecom in if you want to know the complete list of these commands.

1172
02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:21.030
Jones, Edward R: You can go to.

1173
02:41:23.820 --> 02:41:26.580
Jones, Edward R: The manuals that we talked about here.

1174
02:41:29.730 --> 02:41:30.270
Jones, Edward R: and

1175
02:41:31.560 --> 02:41:32.910
Jones, Edward R: These guys right here.

1176
02:41:34.110 --> 02:41:41.910
Jones, Edward R: You can you can open up 1.3 or 2.0 if you have EDU i'd open up 2.0 i'm going to go ahead and open up 2.0.

1177
02:41:43.980 --> 02:41:44.670
Jones, Edward R: And here we go.

1178
02:41:46.620 --> 02:41:47.280
Jones, Edward R: So.

1179
02:41:49.770 --> 02:41:52.020
Jones, Edward R: This is 2.0 and.

1180
02:41:53.400 --> 02:42:05.940
Jones, Edward R: This is telling you upfront about sin command, you have to send the command fans the to get it to actually operate first, but then once it's operated, these are the commands so like up X.

1181
02:42:06.720 --> 02:42:19.560
Jones, Edward R: means rates go up in altitude X centimeters so, then our normal value for X would be 20 or 30 or 40 or 50, but it could go all the way up to 500.

1182
02:42:21.300 --> 02:42:32.790
Jones, Edward R: So 500 that would be more like five meters were up and up so that would be like almost 15 feet right, so you don't say 500 in your House, unless you got a really tall ceiling.

1183
02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:41.040
Jones, Edward R: that's Okay, by the way, if you say 500 is going to go up and hit the ceiling bounce off and try to keep trying to go through that ceiling.

1184
02:42:41.940 --> 02:43:10.170
Jones, Edward R: And finally it'll hit something and crash, but then you have left left X again, you should be a number between 20 and 500 forward and back CW means rotate clockwise CCW rotate counterclockwise and those are degrees, so if you say CW 360 it's going to go clockwise 360 degrees.

1185
02:43:12.570 --> 02:43:24.930
Jones, Edward R: And then there's a flip and you can flip left right forward or back, and that means that the drone will actually flip to the left or to the right completely over and then reset itself and.

1186
02:43:26.280 --> 02:43:39.930
Jones, Edward R: it's kind of cute not very functional it's cute it's kind of cool Okay, and then you can say go xyz speed and what that means is I want you to go to the xyz coordinates.

1187
02:43:40.980 --> 02:43:44.940
Jones, Edward R: And so, this is a three dimensional things Z represents the hype.

1188
02:43:46.050 --> 02:43:48.960
Jones, Edward R: X and y represent the directions over the ground.

1189
02:43:50.160 --> 02:43:56.370
Jones, Edward R: And then speed can be anything between what does it say 10 and 100 usually around 50.

1190
02:43:57.660 --> 02:44:03.030
Jones, Edward R: But the higher, the number, the faster that it that it actually goes there so.

1191
02:44:07.440 --> 02:44:25.020
Jones, Edward R: The there are some fancy ones like curve and you see this as go X, Y Z speed mid that's the mission pad instruction so that's not in 1.3 that instruction is not in 1.3 won't work with a non a EDU drone.

1192
02:44:27.300 --> 02:44:27.990
Jones, Edward R: and

1193
02:44:31.530 --> 02:44:38.820
Jones, Edward R: Then you have read commands like the speed question mark Atlanta is basically a returns, the current speed of the drone.

1194
02:44:39.780 --> 02:44:50.670
Jones, Edward R: Battery question mark what percentage of batteries left so it'll start with like 99 and then go down to 2010 once it drops below 2010 it's going to land.

1195
02:44:51.450 --> 02:45:03.810
Jones, Edward R: Okay, in fact it won't even start and then so if you're trying to start the drone and they won't start check the battery is if it's less than 10% capacity it's not going to start.

1196
02:45:04.170 --> 02:45:16.590
Jones, Edward R: It will he refuses to take off with less than 10% battery time is how long it's been running not how long it's been turned on, but how long it's actually in the air.

1197
02:45:17.910 --> 02:45:30.900
Jones, Edward R: wi fi that's showing you the strength of the signal, the higher the number, the better so 90 would be perfect on wi fi and then 20 or 10 not so good.

1198
02:45:32.160 --> 02:45:43.410
Jones, Edward R: SDK will tell you what kind of what version of SDK is is being used by the controller, and then SN is the serial number for the for the drone so.

1199
02:45:44.670 --> 02:46:04.800
Jones, Edward R: that's basically what you have is your commands there are other commands this is easy to commands you can talk to the drone directly over that frequency over the connection so there's a command and it's called sin command and if you go up back a little bit here.

1200
02:46:07.710 --> 02:46:12.210
Jones, Edward R: let's see it said, this is available in 1.3 and also.

1201
02:46:14.340 --> 02:46:16.320
Jones, Edward R: In 2.0.

1202
02:46:17.850 --> 02:46:18.600
Jones, Edward R: we're isn't.

1203
02:46:25.650 --> 02:46:27.090
Jones, Edward R: A wonder if it's.

1204
02:46:28.590 --> 02:46:29.430
Jones, Edward R: documented.

1205
02:46:30.870 --> 02:46:32.880
Jones, Edward R: It may not be documented in here.

1206
02:46:36.900 --> 02:46:37.530
Jones, Edward R: yeah.

1207
02:46:38.700 --> 02:46:47.880
Jones, Edward R: There is a special command that's not document it's called sin command and, in that you send it a string and you can send the.

1208
02:46:48.570 --> 02:47:01.710
Jones, Edward R: command in the string and that gives you access to things that are not really in this and easy hello, there are a few commands that you can use, I will will see those being used from time to time.

1209
02:47:03.030 --> 02:47:09.150
Jones, Edward R: You can enable or disable to the video stream, which is, which should have should be interesting to do that as well.

1210
02:47:09.600 --> 02:47:15.750
Jones, Edward R: Okay, so that's that's about it for tonight, are there any questions before we leave.

1211
02:47:17.550 --> 02:47:19.740
Karis Jochen: I have a question, this is charisse.

1212
02:47:19.920 --> 02:47:20.910
Jones, Edward R: Oh carrie how are you.

1213
02:47:21.360 --> 02:47:22.650
Karis Jochen: i'm good, how are you.

1214
02:47:22.920 --> 02:47:23.490
Okay.

1215
02:47:24.570 --> 02:47:40.740
Karis Jochen: um my question is with with these in the drone Are we only is it limited to flying within wi fi connection or a house or could we What if we wanted.

1216
02:47:42.300 --> 02:47:45.420
Karis Jochen: To take it to a park or something to test it.

1217
02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:45.930
Okay.

1218
02:47:47.310 --> 02:47:50.100
Jones, Edward R: Okay, now, this is an interesting question.

1219
02:47:52.440 --> 02:48:02.730
Jones, Edward R: When I say they're connected by a drone there, they are they're connected on their private you and me kind of connection you're they're not the drone is not using your home wi fi.

1220
02:48:03.510 --> 02:48:15.300
Jones, Edward R: You do not need to be at home, you can be in the park because be what's happening here is the drone the drone is sending out a wi fi signal on a son frequency it's about 1010 hertz.

1221
02:48:15.930 --> 02:48:28.950
Jones, Edward R: And so it's submitted it sets up a wi fi connection the drone is programmed to do that and your computer is programmed to connect to other wi fi systems.

1222
02:48:30.030 --> 02:48:34.830
Jones, Edward R: So you know you go to your neighbor's house, you can connect to their wi fi system right.

1223
02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:39.360
Jones, Edward R: And he at home, you connect to your wi fi system different connections.

1224
02:48:40.410 --> 02:48:53.760
Jones, Edward R: Because your computer can can this is mobile it can go and connect here connect there and so what's happening is your computer is connecting directly to that drone and that drone is acting like a wi fi server.

1225
02:48:54.930 --> 02:48:55.290
Jones, Edward R: Okay.

1226
02:48:56.820 --> 02:48:58.410
Jones, Edward R: and accepting those connections.

1227
02:49:00.450 --> 02:49:09.870
Jones, Edward R: That also means, by the way, technically speaking, that somebody could steal your somebody could take over your drone you know Mister Mister hacker there.

1228
02:49:10.620 --> 02:49:21.390
Jones, Edward R: They could look at the signal and say Oh, I can do that, so there is a way to password protect that that connection, but we don't use it, because our connections are so short.

1229
02:49:21.870 --> 02:49:37.560
Jones, Edward R: The drones in the same room or whatever we don't worry about that, but if you're working with a real drone where you're the distance between you and the drone might be like five kilometers, then you might want to be more careful about making sure that the connection is protected.

1230
02:49:38.850 --> 02:49:53.220
Karis Jochen: right that makes sense, so So if you wanted to do the Python program to control your drone in the park, you would you would have to bring your computer right.

1231
02:49:54.120 --> 02:50:10.530
Karis Jochen: i'm thinking in a real world setting like how how How would you do it where someone someone else who doesn't have my Python program could could utilize it to fly their own john.

1232
02:50:11.880 --> 02:50:12.360
Jones, Edward R: yeah.

1233
02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:25.050
Jones, Edward R: Well, you see what there's a year there they did with the of the smartphone and with the iPad they basically wrote an APP to go in the iPad that is working like your computer.

1234
02:50:26.100 --> 02:50:41.850
Jones, Edward R: And so the the your iPad connects to the drone using it as this were a different wi fi system, and then the APP talks to the drone over wi fi connection sending it these kind of commands that you see here.

1235
02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:55.590
Jones, Edward R: So this basically what yeah if you're not going to use your computer you're going to use something like a computer smartphone or a iPad or something like that.

1236
02:50:56.670 --> 02:51:02.640
Jones, Edward R: However, nowadays, more and more drone flights are being computerized so.

1237
02:51:04.650 --> 02:51:13.560
Jones, Edward R: I should sometimes show you some pictures, but they are there, they are really developing drones for delivering packages that's probably going to happen.

1238
02:51:14.610 --> 02:51:21.840
Jones, Edward R: They already have drones that are used in agriculture, where the drone whereas flies out over the field and drops or sprays.

1239
02:51:22.980 --> 02:51:34.560
Jones, Edward R: pesticide and things like that, and then they have other drones that are used in constructions a survey, you know regular surveys of construction progress, and also the.

1240
02:51:35.490 --> 02:51:44.160
Jones, Edward R: Spending infrastructure, like electrical grids and things like that have a drone fly around, and these are all done by controlled by computers and it automatic.

1241
02:51:44.580 --> 02:51:56.220
Jones, Edward R: So you can buy now a little station it's like a little house and the drone lives in that house and automatically wakes up one in the clock goes off flies out.

1242
02:51:56.760 --> 02:52:06.510
Jones, Edward R: flies a definite route that's been programmed to fly takes pictures comes back and sends those pictures on the Internet to whoever their bosses right.

1243
02:52:07.710 --> 02:52:26.010
Jones, Edward R: The police people in the end the rescue people are using drones to fly out and find people that are lost in the forest, for example, or in the case of water, they may be, in the water, and then you drop the needle drop to them a life raft or a road a color.

1244
02:52:27.720 --> 02:52:29.280
Jones, Edward R: Like that you know.

1245
02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:40.140
Jones, Edward R: So there, there are a huge number of applications for drones other than taking pictures and just having fun.

1246
02:52:42.060 --> 02:52:44.820
Jones, Edward R: The fun market is huge, but.

1247
02:52:46.680 --> 02:52:53.580
Jones, Edward R: On the practical side tip out there, a lot of police departments that are getting some of these drones their larger ones.

1248
02:52:54.780 --> 02:53:01.530
Jones, Edward R: To take the place of running a helicopter right, so instead of launching a hugely expensive helicopter the watch a drone.

1249
02:53:02.160 --> 02:53:09.660
Jones, Edward R: or several drones and look out looking over different looking for people and things like that these are the systems that they buy.

1250
02:53:10.230 --> 02:53:28.170
Jones, Edward R: are typically somewhere around 100 to $200,000 for each drone because they not only have a large drone but then they have the infrastructure to support that which is a lot of compute some computers and people trying to you know operate that system so.

1251
02:53:30.030 --> 02:53:36.780
Jones, Edward R: So there's there's a lot going on, besides just what the sort of thing we're doing right here, but it all gets down to programming.

1252
02:53:38.100 --> 02:53:45.480
Jones, Edward R: You know all of those drones are basically going to be autonomous vehicles and somebody's going to have to program it to be hey well.

1253
02:53:45.810 --> 02:53:54.150
Jones, Edward R: To do whatever it is that they're looking for so there'll be programming them to recognize somebody in the water, for example, if you're looking at a rescue drone.

1254
02:53:54.990 --> 02:54:10.860
Jones, Edward R: Or if you're looking at a police drone they'll be programmed to go to a certain location look for certain people and apply them and follow them, you know they can you can do that, using the Ai software for image detection and that sort of thing.

1255
02:54:13.800 --> 02:54:18.630
Jones, Edward R: So I think I think it's pretty exciting but business wise, by the way, I think it's pretty exciting area.

1256
02:54:19.410 --> 02:54:24.540
Jones, Edward R: If you have the backing you know the resources to to do this sort of thing.

1257
02:54:27.330 --> 02:54:28.500
Jones, Edward R: Any other questions garish.

1258
02:54:28.800 --> 02:54:30.120
Fireman, Karen: Yes, Doctor to doctor.

1259
02:54:31.350 --> 02:54:34.890
Karis Jochen: No, that was great Thank you so much for the explanation.

1260
02:54:35.010 --> 02:54:35.640
sure.

1261
02:54:36.870 --> 02:54:45.270
Fireman, Karen: uh cajones it's Karen I was just wondering um I know you're always very cautious about when you give your credit card and things like that, when I have the.

1262
02:54:45.750 --> 02:55:00.660
Fireman, Karen: APP this afternoon, it was asking for access to all my photos I guess it obviously it takes photos but it didn't it wasn't very forthcoming about it, some privacy settings and how it was using data, how it was stealing data.

1263
02:55:01.680 --> 02:55:08.460
Fireman, Karen: So you have no problem, putting it on your phone and having giving you access to all your photos.

1264
02:55:09.300 --> 02:55:10.080
Of.

1265
02:55:12.630 --> 02:55:13.980
Jones, Edward R: The interesting conversation.

1266
02:55:16.710 --> 02:55:26.370
Jones, Edward R: Because it turns out, privacy, here is a real big issue because you're you know you're taking photographs and or potentially taking photographs and long train things.

1267
02:55:28.320 --> 02:55:37.290
Jones, Edward R: The United States army put out a letter about two years ago, prohibiting anybody in the butchery from buying a Chinese drone.

1268
02:55:38.910 --> 02:55:40.920
Fireman, Karen: right because it's probably listening it.

1269
02:55:41.370 --> 02:55:46.380
Jones, Edward R: Well, the thing is whether there is or there is a here's the deal.

1270
02:55:46.800 --> 02:55:57.420
Jones, Edward R: there's another APP called it's called kitty Hawk and there are a couple of Apps that you that if you're flying outside you use these Apps to make sure that your legal.

1271
02:55:57.990 --> 02:56:05.010
Jones, Edward R: Which means you're not in a no fly zone and they're all no fly zones are all over any places and airport there's a no fly zone right.

1272
02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:10.680
Jones, Edward R: So they have Apps that basically check your location and make sure you're not in one of those no.

1273
02:56:11.070 --> 02:56:29.400
Jones, Edward R: No, no area is right, and then the other thing that these Apps will do for you is that actually log your entire flight so every flight is can be automatically logged totally which means all the pictures all the video and exactly where you were at what time.

1274
02:56:31.080 --> 02:56:43.770
Jones, Edward R: Now, the reason they provide this, as this is a default scenario, by the way they by default the drones are set up to do this they're set up to when they're flying record everything.

1275
02:56:44.280 --> 02:56:59.310
Jones, Edward R: And that goes into a cloud that they basically a computer database online, and it also goes, you can go into your home into your computer your smartphone or your your pad over there, or what have you.

1276
02:57:01.020 --> 02:57:12.210
Jones, Edward R: So by default there's there's some settings that are automatically logging everything that's going on, and so the army didn't like that, then they found out that the.

1277
02:57:12.660 --> 02:57:26.730
Jones, Edward R: The cloud was in China right, so the logs go online and then the logs over the Internet over to someplace in China, and they have photographs of the inside of military installations and things like that.

1278
02:57:27.510 --> 02:57:40.830
Jones, Edward R: So, but the thing is, there is a very relatively simple thing to stop that from happening, the owner of the drone that's that's an optional sort of thing that, by default, will do that, but you can turn it off.

1279
02:57:41.940 --> 02:57:56.550
Jones, Edward R: And you can erase those logs and things like that, but you have the, but if you don't if you really want to be secure about that yeah turn it off now when you turn it off what happens if your drone flies away and gets lost.

1280
02:57:58.260 --> 02:58:15.570
Jones, Edward R: You can't find it so the reason, the reason is for the blogs, is that, if your drone should fly away and it happens when you lose the signal, it could happen, it could happen when you lose a signal can fly away well, you can let you if you've got the log you can find it may be most likely.

1281
02:58:16.500 --> 02:58:18.210
Jones, Edward R: But if you don't have a log you can't find it.

1282
02:58:18.240 --> 02:58:20.340
Jones, Edward R: So that's the there's.

1283
02:58:20.340 --> 02:58:21.720
Fireman, Karen: A try to get you right.

1284
02:58:21.810 --> 02:58:27.360
Jones, Edward R: that's yeah yeah, so I think if you're if you're just a recreational user.

1285
02:58:28.740 --> 02:58:38.670
Jones, Edward R: it's probably not a big deal, but if you're doing commercial or Mille our government work yeah it's a big deal so gotcha.

1286
02:58:38.850 --> 02:58:41.070
Fireman, Karen: Thanks, so you do it right.

1287
02:58:43.200 --> 02:58:46.080
Jones, Edward R: For myself, I don't really care, I want to find my drone.

1288
02:58:46.800 --> 02:58:50.790
Jones, Edward R: Right and the my purpose, is what I what i've taken a picture of the House.

1289
02:58:51.930 --> 02:58:52.830
Jones, Edward R: it's not a big deal.

1290
02:58:53.970 --> 02:58:58.740
Fireman, Karen: When i'm actually partly saying also is not only do they have access to the things in your flight.

1291
02:58:59.040 --> 02:59:05.700
Fireman, Karen: But by asking to have access to your photos if you can pictures of things that are your credit cards or your.

1292
02:59:05.940 --> 02:59:17.040
Fireman, Karen: Statements or your license or any other important thing that a lot of times people just send a quick picture and then you know they have it later, or they bought this or did that they have access to all that well.

1293
02:59:17.070 --> 02:59:21.990
Jordan Gross: Karen I would say that if you're using an iPhone, at least on the absolute latest operating system.

1294
02:59:22.230 --> 02:59:34.650
Jordan Gross: You can tell it that it is only allowed to access select photos not all photos have been your privacy settings so that it's not even able to see anything that you didn't explicitly tell it, it can get into.

1295
02:59:34.980 --> 02:59:44.400
Jordan Gross: And that's at the firmware level, so it would be blocking them out of the photos folder because you told them they can't go there now that's ios I can't speak to android.

1296
02:59:45.600 --> 02:59:50.280
Fireman, Karen: No i'm on my mom i'm your guy all the way that's great to know.

1297
02:59:51.120 --> 02:59:52.170
Jordan Gross: yeah absolutely.

1298
02:59:54.780 --> 02:59:56.610
Jones, Edward R: yeah I don't I don't think the.

1299
02:59:57.660 --> 02:59:58.110
Jones, Edward R: The.

1300
02:59:59.250 --> 03:00:03.150
Jones, Edward R: you're accessing your photos and credit card as usual that's usually a separate deal.

1301
03:00:04.920 --> 03:00:11.460
Jones, Edward R: it's just the the actual flight itself and the video that you're taking that so that's pretty accessible.

1302
03:00:12.750 --> 03:00:26.220
Jones, Edward R: And they actually the law enforcement kind of like that that they find somebody did something illegal like final word airport they may be a way that person was they would do find out who that was.

1303
03:00:27.990 --> 03:00:31.200
Fireman, Karen: Thank you for your out who store up the capital, I don't i'm not worried.

1304
03:00:32.460 --> 03:00:33.120
Jones, Edward R: yeah.

1305
03:00:34.560 --> 03:00:35.820
Jones, Edward R: and your credit card that's.

1306
03:00:37.620 --> 03:00:41.820
Jones, Edward R: We give up, I give up my my credit card goes out every day in some way.

1307
03:00:43.950 --> 03:00:52.590
Jones, Edward R: And so I just tell it on a protection there is to watch your bank account, make sure there's no was using the free legal purposes on offers.
