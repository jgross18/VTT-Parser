00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.220
Christian Gover: Hello.

2
00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.770
Christian Gover: Is it just me right now.

3
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.840
Faculty Office Hours: Well i'm here also.

4
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.440
Faculty Office Hours: Yes, it's just the two of us.

5
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.670
Faculty Office Hours: Are you are, you are you lurking or you have a question.

6
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.710
Christian Gover: I guess, I had a question I did that you posted a video right.

7
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:23.310
Christian Gover: So that's good, I guess, I was wondering more about the expand command that you mentioned in the homework assignment, at the very end.

8
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.240
Faculty Office Hours: let's see i'm looking.

9
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:45.810
Faculty Office Hours: I don't see the expand and the homework you mean just you're curious about the so how how and when you would use it.

10
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:56.730
Christian Gover: um yeah I thought it was there, so on on Question three at the very end after the num net profit products equals 2743.

11
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:03.210
Faculty Office Hours: Oh so so that's that's that's in the hint and, and so the suggestion is that.

12
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:09.450
Faculty Office Hours: When you expand a model that uses.

13
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:31.200
Faculty Office Hours: Sets and index sets in a raise expanded model is still going to look the same the names of the variables are going to be different, but the model itself should look very similar to the expand of the craft brewery names.

14
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.770
Christian Gover: Okay.

15
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:39.720
Faculty Office Hours: Which is, which is going to look very much the same as the as the kind of.

16
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.730
Faculty Office Hours: The right out of the bottle and on the first page of the homework.

17
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.030
Faculty Office Hours: So instead of saying 2027 times Al.

18
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:51.960
Christian Gover: uh huh.

19
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:57.480
Faculty Office Hours: It would say 27 times, whatever the name of the array of decision variables.

20
00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.310
Faculty Office Hours: Is.

21
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:07.770
Faculty Office Hours: So what do you have you have you have you chosen a name for the array of decision variables.

22
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:13.050
Christian Gover: um, I believe, so I had an array called.

23
00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.690
Christian Gover: ingredients and then I had products.

24
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:20.610
Christian Gover: Yes.

25
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.160
Faculty Office Hours: products would probably be a set.

26
00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.300
yeah.

27
00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:26.760
Faculty Office Hours: So.

28
00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:34.620
Faculty Office Hours: Once you can you show me what you what you your program looks like so far.

29
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.160
Christian Gover: you're if that's allowed, let me share my, then I just.

30
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:40.020
Faculty Office Hours: I will allow that.

31
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:45.240
Christian Gover: Okay, let me start it up share screen first.

32
00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:46.470
Okay.

33
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.760
Christian Gover: I hope you can hear my son crying right now.

34
00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.820
Faculty Office Hours: No he's gonna have to cry a little bit louder i'm afraid.

35
00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.700
Christian Gover: Okay, good good he's yelling in the living room.

36
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.670
Faculty Office Hours: I don't know why it takes us to do so inordinately long to start up it's just not it's not just you.

37
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:12.720
yeah.

38
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:20.520
Christian Gover: Come on, Guy.

39
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.440
Christian Gover: Okay opened up in the other.

40
00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.320
Christian Gover: And then I have to drill down to get to my assignment.

41
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:35.640
Okay.

42
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:43.620
Faculty Office Hours: If anybody else is there in the background, has a quick question i'm happy to answer or waiting for his program to come up.

43
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:48.990
Faculty Office Hours: No takers.

44
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.280
Christian Gover: No takers.

45
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:54.840
Christian Gover: alright.

46
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.210
Christian Gover: Alright, so there's assignment for.

47
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.920
Christian Gover: craft brewery exercise three.

48
00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:08.640
Okay.

49
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:21.450
Faculty Office Hours: So let's let's see so you you're calling your decision variables non prod, which is the same as the same as they're called in the furniture name, which is fine.

50
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:28.290
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so so let's see page down just a little bit more.

51
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:35.610
Faculty Office Hours: So why don't you after after the Max and before the solve to say expand.

52
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.870
Christian Gover: After the Max but, before the song.

53
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:50.790
Faculty Office Hours: So expand is just going to list out your model it's kind of independent of solving it but it's it's good for troubleshooting and let's just go ahead and.

54
00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:59.220
Faculty Office Hours: You can well if you were using interactive mode, you could run it just down to the expand, but you might as well just run the whole thing.

55
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:00.450
Okay.

56
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.530
Christian Gover: yeah all right let's hit save.

57
00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:11.820
Faculty Office Hours: The running the running well some people call it the running man, but we try and call it the running person.

58
00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.060
Christian Gover: Or, I can hit F3 too awesome yep.

59
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.230
Faculty Office Hours: There you go so um.

60
00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:24.000
Faculty Office Hours: And let's look at, so in that box, you can see the the the the result of the expand.

61
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.080
mm hmm.

62
00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:35.790
Faculty Office Hours: So let's see so you have your decision variables that are non negative, you can see your objective, and you can compare your objective to the one.

63
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:50.580
Faculty Office Hours: On the previous page and your constraints are a little bit simpler well, if you want to compare your constraints to the one on the on the first page of the homework assignment, you would kind of.

64
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:58.980
Faculty Office Hours: You would kind of plug in the implicit variables, so the first one says usage of corn.

65
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.520
Faculty Office Hours: or availability of corn is less than or equal to 480.

66
00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:16.710
Faculty Office Hours: And so, look up where the availability of corn is is defined that as an implicit variables so it's five times nonprofit avail plus 15 times now i'm proud of beer.

67
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:17.700
Christian Gover: All right.

68
00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.260
Faculty Office Hours: that's less than or equal to 480 So you can see the similarity between that and the.

69
00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.220
Faculty Office Hours: And the program on the first page.

70
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.440
Faculty Office Hours: Or does that make sense.

71
00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.000
Christian Gover: yeah that makes sense.

72
00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:37.200
Faculty Office Hours: So, so they expand statement is basically just kind of a troubleshooting feature doesn't really affect.

73
00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:39.870
Faculty Office Hours: The the model at all.

74
00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:48.420
Faculty Office Hours: Whatever the model was going to be before you expand it it's still going to be the same thing, but you might notice.

75
00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.880
Faculty Office Hours: logical error by looking at the expand that you might not have noticed, otherwise.

76
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:56.010
Christian Gover: Okay.

77
00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:17.130
Faculty Office Hours: So it's just a suggestion so like if if if, for some reason, your model was working you could try and expand it and see if you could figure out what it was that was causing the problem if it runs fine, then it really is it's not necessary, so did you get a reasonable answer, do you think.

78
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:23.730
Christian Gover: He is similar to what I got in question one and two, so I I guess that's okay.

79
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:33.300
Faculty Office Hours: So you should get the exact same solution that you would get from running craft brewery names, yes, exactly the same model it's just got different names for things.

80
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.100
Christian Gover: Correct yeah I got I just didn't want to give too much away but you're not recording this.

81
00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.510
Faculty Office Hours: I don't know I i'm not it's not me anyway.

82
00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.320
Christian Gover: Okay yeah I think they usually record these but.

83
00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:49.290
Faculty Office Hours: I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about it okay.

84
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:50.850
Christian Gover: yeah.

85
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:54.030
Faculty Office Hours: You could just let us take out a copyright on your on your work.

86
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.450
Christian Gover: Take a copy like just to.

87
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:04.560
Faculty Office Hours: You know, take out a copyright on your material, so that if anyone uses it, you could say you know 15%.

88
00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.270
Christian Gover: yeah I guess.

89
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:15.390
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so it looks like you should be fine then yeah I answer that you're having any any problems.

90
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.730
Christian Gover: And I didn't have any error messages or.

91
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.920
Faculty Office Hours: Anything So do you know how to save.

92
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.900
Faculty Office Hours: Save the log so that you can submit it.

93
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.680
Christian Gover: i'm kind of maybe.

94
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:30.870
Faculty Office Hours: I so try that try there's a like a save as or save log.

95
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:32.940
Christian Gover: log ass.

96
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.040
Faculty Office Hours: yeah and that will save it as a text file.

97
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.850
Faculty Office Hours: And then you can just submit that with your homework.

98
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:40.350
Christian Gover: Okay, all right.

99
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:49.020
Faculty Office Hours: It says log but it's a text file is just that you know SAS will note open as a log if you try to open it in SAS but otherwise it's just a text file.

100
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:55.770
Christian Gover: Okay, all right that sounds good, I thought it'd be like some kind of non text file that's good.

101
00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:05.880
Christian Gover: yeah so I guess that was my only question really was the end was pretty simple I didn't know about the expand command so thanks.

102
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:27.060
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so it's just it's just a troubleshooting thing it's just a so you like any kind of language that has syntax you need a way to kind of debug, and so the log file is part of that you know, so it tells you if there's any syntax errors, but it won't necessarily catch logical errors.

103
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:43.080
Faculty Office Hours: yeah and so for those that expand is useful and beyond that it's also you know it's kind of check the check the answer against your problem, and your problem data, you know, say, does this does this make sense could actually do this.

104
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.730
Faculty Office Hours: And and and sometimes the answer is just like clearly something's wrong here, this is like you know telling you to.

105
00:19:51.210 --> 00:20:01.530
Faculty Office Hours: To you know produce way too much or produce nothing, or something like that, and then you can go to go back and troubleshoot Okay, where did I make a logical error that's allowing that solution to be feasible.

106
00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:10.830
Christian Gover: yeah I guess i'd say it's hard to read all this stuff if you haven't really seen him before i'm not really a SAS guy.

107
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.620
Christian Gover: It will, if it's any concentrate on.

108
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.300
Faculty Office Hours: either in mind so we're that.

109
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:23.490
Faculty Office Hours: If someone asked me to do some kind of like merging data sets or something i'd have to Google it.

110
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.080
Christian Gover: yeah yeah.

111
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:32.250
Christian Gover: Okay alright that sounds good, well That was my question I don't know if anyone else has anything but.

112
00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:36.780
Jim Clark: This, this is a.

113
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:42.060
Jim Clark: Small question about SAS version numbers and what.

114
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:51.810
Jim Clark: Is the background that display in the style is different than what what I have in mind, so I don't know patches setting up the environment.

115
00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.870
Faculty Office Hours: So, are you running SAS studio.

116
00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:57.750
Jim Clark: believe my am.

117
00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:10.110
Jim Clark: So it's it's not something that me i'm getting the same mathematical calculation of the same answer to this, yes I just didn't know if maybe as we get further in the Semester If only some things that.

118
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.660
Faculty Office Hours: You know what can you show me what you see.

119
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:13.470
sure.

120
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.050
Faculty Office Hours: Jim I think you're muted now.

121
00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:56.310
Jim Clark: filling up.

122
00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:57.540
Okay.

123
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.150
Jim Clark: So that's the box.

124
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.470
Jim Clark: Sets video three seven so.

125
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.360
Jim Clark: Well, it is the same now that I.

126
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:42.660
Faculty Office Hours: Well it's possible that that you might have opened up the display manager before, which is, I think I shared a screenshot with you.

127
00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.730
Faculty Office Hours: it's it's if you open up what's called SAS 9.4.

128
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:49.800
Jim Clark: Right.

129
00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:58.320
Faculty Office Hours: Then, then that will be the display manager was just kind of like SAS for windows and it's a it's a fairly different looking environment you.

130
00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:12.870
Faculty Office Hours: it's not that you can't do it has much the same functionality SAS studio is a little bit nicer in terms of giving you prompts it's nicer in terms of giving you options to save the different.

131
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:29.130
Faculty Office Hours: Parts the log and the results so one of the nice things that you can do in SAS studio is you can save your results as that rich text file and you can't do those things in the display manager it's a little more primitive.

132
00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.470
Jim Clark: It made they made, I made the running nine four and.

133
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:44.250
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I mean there's nothing wrong with it it's you know it's got a lot of this, the same functionality, it will sound like the algorithms won't work or anything like that it's more just the.

134
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.880
Faculty Office Hours: The kind of window dressing.

135
00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:48.990
Faculty Office Hours: is good it.

136
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:59.310
Jim Clark: was where I discovered I didn't really feel compromised and so finding my log file out typically I want to get the output file.

137
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:06.450
Jim Clark: And it wouldn't let me do that very well, but I just copy the login pages of text.

138
00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:19.710
Faculty Office Hours: On your studio you can there's a save, save log as and you can save it as just basically saves it as a text file it's just that still means you're then copying and pasting.

139
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:21.300
Jim Clark: Right okay.

140
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:23.850
Jim Clark: Thanks for letting.

141
00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.810
Faculty Office Hours: me look in the in the first weeks.

142
00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:36.480
Faculty Office Hours: notes there's a picture of the display manager so you'll know if that's what you're in if it looks like the picture.

143
00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:43.020
Jim Clark: All right, I don't want to hold up the session but i'll go and confirm that Sir.

144
00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:43.590
Okay.

145
00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:54.840
Jim Clark: So that was my question it looked like I was getting me to me, is by getting the same answer, except going through setting up a raise, and so I think, because it will do that.

146
00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.690
Jim Clark: Okay, so thank you.

147
00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:58.530
sure.

148
00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:03.930
Monica A. Harwig: hi i'm Monica.

149
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:06.150
Faculty Office Hours: I want to cook what's your question.

150
00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:08.580
Monica A. Harwig: My question is.

151
00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.030
Faculty Office Hours: Should we, I guess, we should let Jim stop sharing for.

152
00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.390
Jim Clark: right to do here we go stop here.

153
00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:24.810
Monica A. Harwig: Okay, so i'm aiming to kind of check i'm about halfway done with my coding and so far i'm thinking i'm doing okay.

154
00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:27.780
Monica A. Harwig: Okay, also, I had a big problem.

155
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:35.610
Monica A. Harwig: Getting sassed open to it wasn't working, and so what I did was I.

156
00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:40.710
Monica A. Harwig: Someone they said what i'm using is a.

157
00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:43.980
Monica A. Harwig: I went and downloaded this from SAS.

158
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.390
Monica A. Harwig: And i'm using just a minute i'm using.

159
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:55.200
Monica A. Harwig: My 35.7 wouldn't open so now i'm using steph suits that says studio 3.81.

160
00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.270
Monica A. Harwig: Okay, so.

161
00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:18.060
Faculty Office Hours: i'm using SAS to 3.8 on my on my desktop and I don't have any trouble i'm i'm using firefox and it opens up fine In fact I didn't know that it was going to have a problem, opening up until I got to class, the first day because I don't have the same laptop as, as you all do.

162
00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:25.230
Faculty Office Hours: So yeah there's there's there's no there's no reason not to use 3.81 you should be fine.

163
00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:36.570
Faculty Office Hours: I it doesn't it doesn't behave any differently might the appearance might be a little bit different but I don't think it's going to be anything you can adjust to.

164
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:44.130
Monica A. Harwig: Okay, great so that's yeah i'm using it no problem I don't know why couldn't open that I tried several.

165
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:52.830
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I think what they were telling me was that the the browser makes the difference, for whatever reason, on the on the.

166
00:26:53.550 --> 00:27:10.440
Faculty Office Hours: On the installs that you all have on your laptops that doesn't work in some browsers and it works and others, so the I guess it's Cameron helped me change the default browser to IE which pains me greatly, but it works.

167
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:12.660
Monica A. Harwig: Okay.

168
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:16.290
Monica A. Harwig: I shouldn't cram so maybe that has something to do with it i'm not.

169
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:17.730
Faculty Office Hours: Sure it's possible.

170
00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:27.120
Monica A. Harwig: yeah Okay, but yeah i'm halfway finished, it looks like i'm doing okay so far and I guess that was I don't have it.

171
00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:27.690
Faculty Office Hours: So if.

172
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.310
Faculty Office Hours: You know, if you do run into problems just shoot me an email and.

173
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:37.440
Faculty Office Hours: Okay include your program and.

174
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:48.480
Faculty Office Hours: it's also helpful if you if you include the log, but I can always just download your program and run it and see what the problem is, but either way.

175
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:54.930
Monica A. Harwig: Okay, great okay I haven't read my set yet, but when I do and i've had issues are like.

176
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:58.320
Faculty Office Hours: You can also run it like when it's only partially done.

177
00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:05.670
Faculty Office Hours: Because the compiler works top to bottom, so you can you can find out if you have a syntax error already.

178
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:12.330
Faculty Office Hours: And that could you know cuz cuz it you always have to kind of fix it from the top down, because they snowball.

179
00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.900
Monica A. Harwig: mm hmm true okay yeah I can try that as well.

180
00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.990
Monica A. Harwig: Okay Okay, well, I appreciate the information.

181
00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:20.040
Faculty Office Hours: Good luck.

182
00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:20.970
Thanks.

183
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:33.690
Jim Clark: So this is this is Jim Perkins I just remembered another question, I was going to ask about email about that, but when I tried to log.

184
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:47.640
Jim Clark: In and download a trial or student version I guess of a solver works in excel it was wanting some information about the university went to the course name.

185
00:28:48.840 --> 00:29:01.170
Jim Clark: And I kept trying to type versions of be lady 689 or combinations of that, and it was telling me that I was typing the wrong course for side being so.

186
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.510
Faculty Office Hours: I can check with.

187
00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:04.830
Faculty Office Hours: Javier about that, but.

188
00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:17.790
Faculty Office Hours: I don't think I had to I think mind is came with the tribe that that, like the kind of Mickey Mouse version that lets you know up to 200 variables I didn't have to really do anything but like I said.

189
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:27.510
Faculty Office Hours: I don't really have the same I don't have the same setup, as you all okay so it's kind of difficult for me to anticipate problems I have, but I can I can check with Javier.

190
00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:33.990
Jim Clark: Right and then i'd be glad to go through, and show you what i'm feeling, but if it's a different setup than maybe.

191
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:45.060
Jim Clark: That will sit on to john the typical student want while I show you what i'm seeing that I can get with a hobby year later.

192
00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:50.760
Jim Clark: Okay, so let me see you gave me gave us a series of files.

193
00:29:52.170 --> 00:30:02.670
Faculty Office Hours: yeah and it's there's nothing that is necessary about those files it's just that I thought that people would be find it useful to know that they could do.

194
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:08.070
Faculty Office Hours: Many of the same things in excel because a lot of people are comfortable working in spreadsheets.

195
00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:14.100
Jim Clark: So this was a virtual making problem i'm from look at the yeah.

196
00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:18.600
Jim Clark: Because you gave a series of files and we tried it.

197
00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:25.560
Faculty Office Hours: yeah thanks for making this time because the other one we haven't got to yet won't give it to him we'll get to it until the beginning of the next lecture.

198
00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:30.720
Jim Clark: yeah.

199
00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:37.350
Jim Clark: yeah this really doesn't help because it was actually a form, I feel that that's.

200
00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:42.180
Faculty Office Hours: So, but it wouldn't run it wouldn't run straight away.

201
00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.840
Jim Clark: Oh, I didn't try to run a traitor well, I guess, I was.

202
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:50.760
Faculty Office Hours: There once you open it up and we'll see.

203
00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:00.360
Jim Clark: So you can see that, so they were editing.

204
00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.340
Jim Clark: Bay so actually want to go to.

205
00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.710
Faculty Office Hours: The I think it's the data.

206
00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.990
Faculty Office Hours: it's been a while, since i've since i've done that yeah.

207
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:12.990
Faculty Office Hours: Now let me see if I can find this.

208
00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.020
Jim Clark: One to find the solver.

209
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:18.540
Faculty Office Hours: Yes.

210
00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:27.990
Faculty Office Hours: she's like I said it's not it's not something I do a whole lot yeah so let's try that and let's just just push solve.

211
00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:32.700
Faculty Office Hours: And then go back to the spreadsheet.

212
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:38.730
Jim Clark: solve I guess for net profit.

213
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.680
Faculty Office Hours: So, so it looks like it um.

214
00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:43.110
Faculty Office Hours: let's see so.

215
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:47.070
Faculty Office Hours: yeah it looks like it has solved it.

216
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:54.810
Faculty Office Hours: You can see the values of the decision variables there.

217
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:56.250
Right, the objective.

218
00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:02.850
Faculty Office Hours: You can go ahead and just try and change change, one of the variables and then try and hit that salt button again like.

219
00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:06.000
Faculty Office Hours: Where it says 57, no, no, no, those those.

220
00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:08.700
Faculty Office Hours: Oh there, where it says production.

221
00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:12.600
Faculty Office Hours: Those are the decision variables.

222
00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.100
Faculty Office Hours: That first ruin.

223
00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.110
Faculty Office Hours: your nose out maybe.

224
00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:17.220
Make.

225
00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:19.920
Faculty Office Hours: yeah it's making zero.

226
00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.270
Faculty Office Hours: Is it letting you do it.

227
00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:31.170
Jim Clark: receives blessing blessing.

228
00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:40.680
No.

229
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:46.740
Faculty Office Hours: Unfortunately I can't see what's on that on that window is behind my.

230
00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:48.840
Faculty Office Hours: Participants thing.

231
00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.670
Jim Clark: Alright alright sounds good.

232
00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.360
Faculty Office Hours: yeah it looks like it might not be completely defined in there.

233
00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:10.200
Faculty Office Hours: yeah it doesn't look like it's completely defined so we can.

234
00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:11.430
Jim Clark: I am.

235
00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:16.050
Faculty Office Hours: let's go to the one, whereas, can you go to the one where it shows the LP again or.

236
00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:20.130
Jim Clark: Well, from and trying to but it keeps a here we go.

237
00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:22.830
Jim Clark: So i'll in the LP worksheet.

238
00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:24.450
Jim Clark: and

239
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.870
Jim Clark: This change something here, so if you see it in the changes and zero.

240
00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:37.050
Faculty Office Hours: Yet somehow it doesn't look like it's it's connected right, let me, let me see if I can share my screen and.

241
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:38.010
Faculty Office Hours: Here great.

242
00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.500
Jim Clark: missions over works, you know and.

243
00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:52.620
Jim Clark: It was only a problem because he was asking if I invest in a form out to to the little bit more.

244
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:56.190
Jim Clark: Robust solvers I said okay i'll try.

245
00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:04.860
Faculty Office Hours: yeah to get the robust solver you may need to you may need to fork over some money I don't know let's see.

246
00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:08.550
Faculty Office Hours: What am I doing Okay, so let me see if I can get here.

247
00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:20.370
Faculty Office Hours: So this is transportation problem fringe.

248
00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:25.110
Faculty Office Hours: Can you see my screen now.

249
00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:33.600
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so let me see if I can find two happens when I pull up.

250
00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:17.910
Jim Clark: Okay, this is a transportation problem so except for.

251
00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:22.140
Faculty Office Hours: That one we haven't gotten to yet so I don't know if that's going to be so terribly useful.

252
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:31.530
Jim Clark: right if I turn it down everything and then at the standard excel problem size limit, so if if that's up in this that'd be just week that's fine.

253
00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:36.630
Faculty Office Hours: yeah no I, this is, this is just like an extra so you don't really it's not.

254
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.780
Faculty Office Hours: Something something you really need.

255
00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:42.660
Faculty Office Hours: Okay i'm just trying to say is.

256
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:46.440
Jim Clark: running into that wall, so I can let that go for now.

257
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:54.960
Faculty Office Hours: Okay that's fine i'm just trying to see if I, but this may be a I think this machine is new to.

258
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:03.300
Faculty Office Hours: I don't know if I run this program on this machine before.

259
00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:25.650
Jim Clark: When Professor what information if I don't discriminate I guess well everything down and figure out sorted out, you know once I get it on my machine.

260
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.150
Jim Clark: I got a I got you.

261
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.360
Faculty Office Hours: yeah let me, let me get back to you on that i'm not.

262
00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.200
Faculty Office Hours: quite as good as mine.

263
00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:34.920
Faculty Office Hours: I mean.

264
00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:41.670
Jim Clark: The whole reason the whole reason why I asked without being denied, something that I thought we were going to remind cover in class on Thursday.

265
00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:44.460
Faculty Office Hours: No, no, no, not not not as such.

266
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:49.440
Jim Clark: See sorry sorry to hold the glass of.

267
00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.820
Faculty Office Hours: that's fine that's fine.

268
00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:53.340
Faculty Office Hours: But it's good to know that.

269
00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:57.840
Faculty Office Hours: i'll look into it and put announcement out there.

270
00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.510
Faculty Office Hours: I will have another question.

271
00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:02.790
Faculty Office Hours: Hopefully, an easier one.

272
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:03.870
Faculty Office Hours: well.

273
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.130
Satyam: I can ask an easy one.

274
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:09.060
Satyam: Okay, can you hear me Dr hartman.

275
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.130
Satyam: I can yeah perfect yeah.

276
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:20.760
Satyam: Basically, I think, I just wanted to understand those solvers you talked about in the class like how they approach the solution.

277
00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:30.030
Satyam: Like a primer simplex or dual simplex or interior point or maybe you can repeat that one more time sure yeah.

278
00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:31.470
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so.

279
00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:41.010
Faculty Office Hours: They all they all accomplish the same goal, which is to find the optimal solution, but they take slightly different paths to get there.

280
00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:47.760
Faculty Office Hours: The way that the primal simplex algorithm works is that it finds.

281
00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:56.190
Faculty Office Hours: First of all, or initially it finds an extreme point solution just without regard to the objective at all.

282
00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:01.230
Faculty Office Hours: And then it moves from one extreme point solution to another.

283
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:10.080
Faculty Office Hours: Well, if we're maximizing increases the objective value so in two dimensions it's moving around the perimeter.

284
00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:22.500
Faculty Office Hours: Of the Polygon in one direction or the other, until it finds the optimal solution in three dimensions, you can think of it as being like a solid yeah and it goes around the edges in some way.

285
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:30.450
Faculty Office Hours: And and there you start to see some of the utility there in in two dimensions, you might think, well, it has to go through half the points.

286
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:49.320
Faculty Office Hours: But in three dimensions, the number of those extreme points that it visits on its path is very small fraction of possibly the total and in higher dimensions it it goes through an even smaller fraction of the total number, so it never has to find them all and it never actually has to.

287
00:38:51.270 --> 00:39:05.490
Faculty Office Hours: It really kind of reduces to just linear algebra how it finds the direction to go and then it kind of test to see how far I can go and the farthest that can go get the next corner, so to speak, so it never really.

288
00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:18.360
Faculty Office Hours: kind of visualizes the the solution space like that it's kind of all reduced to linear algebra but that's what the that's what the path looks like in the smaller dimensional case.

289
00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:30.000
Satyam: So basically, I mean just to summarize you, you are taking all the constraint equations you're solving for the roots basically basically you're solving for X and y Z like into the two dimensional place.

290
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:31.380
Satyam: route i'm sorry space.

291
00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:39.360
Satyam: And then you are going through each point right and those could be a solution, whichever optimizes the objective function that is your optimal solution.

292
00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:43.890
Faculty Office Hours: Well, so let's let's say we just going to guess to have the constraints.

293
00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:44.370
Satyam: yeah.

294
00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:53.010
Faculty Office Hours: All right, and then we solve those yeah, because if we try and solve them all, then there isn't going to be one one solution that satisfies all.

295
00:39:54.300 --> 00:40:04.800
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, because, because the the the the feasible region usually isn't the point it's a it's a shape yeah and the corners of the shape are defined by the solutions of.

296
00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:17.430
Faculty Office Hours: pairs in two dimensions of the constraints, so we just pick two of the constraints and we solve and we find that point and then we're going to move to a new point which is basically we kind of.

297
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:22.800
Faculty Office Hours: abandoned one of those constraints and pick up a new constraint yeah.

298
00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:24.420
Satyam: Taking two questions at a time.

299
00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:32.700
Faculty Office Hours: yeah and we move to another, and another, and another yeah so when we're moving along and edge.

300
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:36.000
Faculty Office Hours: we're kind of sticking with one constraint.

301
00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:50.880
Faculty Office Hours: letting loose the up the second constraint and then, when we move as far as we can we bumped into another constraint, and then we get a new pair yeah and then we move to another parent and other parent in higher dimensions, of course, instead of Paris, we have cripples or.

302
00:40:52.440 --> 00:41:00.030
Faculty Office Hours: So to for constraints so However, whatever the dimension of the spaces that's how many constraints determine one of those corners.

303
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:05.310
Satyam: I mean, in three dimensions, like, I mean I can't think higher than that, but in three dimensions.

304
00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:15.150
Satyam: audio chicken checking each point on the intersection of two planes like on that line or it's how are you i'm still checking the corners only.

305
00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:22.650
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so that would be will be if we're in three dimensions, we have three planes that meeting, a point yeah and.

306
00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.990
Satyam: Okay, so you're asking three constraints, at a time.

307
00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:26.280
Satyam: check drawing.

308
00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.190
Faculty Office Hours: yeah and the other two intersect in a line.

309
00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.710
Faculty Office Hours: And we move along that line.

310
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.640
Faculty Office Hours: bump into the next constraint okay gotcha.

311
00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:44.670
Satyam: yeah I mean the optimal solution is still going to lie on one of those corners, or it could be dang line or it could be then.

312
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:47.940
Faculty Office Hours: It is it is it's an entire line yeah.

313
00:41:49.050 --> 00:42:06.210
Faculty Office Hours: Most of the time it's just a single point yeah, but it really kind of depends on you can always choose an objective that's parallel to one of the constraints and then it'll be alive yeah and in higher dimensions, it could be more than a line, it could be a plane.

314
00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:11.880
Faculty Office Hours: yeah you know well, not so much a plane, but a kind of a like like a Polygon yeah yeah.

315
00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:27.570
Faculty Office Hours: But a priori you don't know yeah and you could say, well, the chances are things are random it would always be a point, but in practice we don't solve random problems we solve problems with data and so occasionally will be the case that we have.

316
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:42.060
Faculty Office Hours: More than one optimal solutions let's move on to the next one let's look at the dual supply the ups, yes please so so likewise it it it moves through a sequence of points that are intersections of the constraints.

317
00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:48.300
Faculty Office Hours: But in this case, instead of being intersections of the constraints that are feasible.

318
00:42:50.280 --> 00:43:03.330
Faculty Office Hours: Their their points that are outside the feasible region and are super optimal which means it's a fat kind of fancy way of saying their objective value is bigger than the best that you could get from any feasible point.

319
00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:05.640
Faculty Office Hours: And so.

320
00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:14.400
Faculty Office Hours: Those points move in a different way, because they're their goal is to achieve feasibility.

321
00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:26.820
Faculty Office Hours: While maintaining the super optimum ality and as soon as they do, then you have a point that's feasible and is has an objective value better than the best feasible point so it's gotta be.

322
00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:41.880
Faculty Office Hours: it's gotta be the optimal solution so it's um it's it's kind of a strange approach, but if, so there is a notion of linear programming of a dual problem so every every.

323
00:43:42.510 --> 00:44:01.320
Faculty Office Hours: Every linear programming problem has a dual problem that is a it like another dimensional space, and if you traced out the primal simplex in that dual space for that door problem, it would be the dual simplex algorithm so it's got a motivation that's.

324
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:04.800
Faculty Office Hours: similar to the primal simplex, but when you kind of.

325
00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.030
Faculty Office Hours: Translated into the.

326
00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:17.460
Faculty Office Hours: original states, it looks like it comes from the outside and for whatever reason, I mean all we care about in solving these problems is, we want the most efficient method.

327
00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:21.150
Faculty Office Hours: Even if it's not the simplest to explain.

328
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:24.750
Faculty Office Hours: yeah and yeah, and so the dual simplex is the winner there.

329
00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.730
Faculty Office Hours: And the interior point method is.

330
00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:42.480
Faculty Office Hours: kind of simultaneously trying to achieve feasibility and ophthalmology in a way that kind of has a trade off between the two, so it might be outside inside outside inside until it finally reaches the same point.

331
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:44.850
Faculty Office Hours: So.

332
00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:57.000
Faculty Office Hours: I mean if it helps to understand you know how the methods work um when we looked at the log file the log file would be pretty confusing if you didn't know how the methods worked.

333
00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:01.080
Faculty Office Hours: That that's that's the utility to explain them.

334
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:08.880
Satyam: No, I mean makes sense I guess interior point probably is the most of skilled one I guess.

335
00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:19.530
Faculty Office Hours: The way is true and for a long time people had no idea that those kind of approaches would work efficiently yeah and then there was this.

336
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:38.130
Faculty Office Hours: mathematician name render a car car at IBM who came up with an approach to solving linear programming problems, based on nonlinear programming methods that was supposedly far and away the best and better than anything that ever existed, and then it turned out that it.

337
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:41.790
Faculty Office Hours: wasn't quite as good as he said, but it turned.

338
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:46.290
Faculty Office Hours: On the approach in some cases is is is more efficient.

339
00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:48.450
Purkiss, David: Sorry.

340
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:58.650
Faculty Office Hours: Oh that's okay and it's funny it's funny story, because he they try to take out patents on very general classes of algorithms which caused some.

341
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:00.990
Faculty Office Hours: very nervous.

342
00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:02.520
Faculty Office Hours: Okay.

343
00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:18.690
Satyam: yeah I mean, I guess, I mean the closest analogy, I can think of of for the interior point of like like when you're solving a polynomial equation like by section maker on Newton reduction measured, like you, are going both side of the road and then converging on to the.

344
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:29.640
Faculty Office Hours: Those those are definitely those those are the the non linear programming techniques, many of them, you know simplified to those in smaller dimension.

345
00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:39.270
Satyam: I guess that's what we are saying it doing into nonlinear programs, and we are taking the gradient and kind of approaching the local maxima local minima okay.

346
00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:40.920
Faculty Office Hours: yeah and.

347
00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:57.510
Faculty Office Hours: it's kind of surprising that that would actually work for linear programming problems because it's the reason you do those kinds of things is because the problems are are complicated by the non linearity but turns out that it's it's been successful.

348
00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:12.750
Satyam: Okay, well, no thanks for answering the question I guess I yeah I will i'm doing okay on the assignment side, I think the syntax will take some time to get used to it, I mean i'm i'm new to SAS programming, I mean.

349
00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:33.060
Faculty Office Hours: So well if it's any consolation the syntax is not really SAS syntax much of it so even people who have a SAS background are uncomfortable with the syntax it's more the modeling language Okay, but you should be able to pick it up in about seven weeks so.

350
00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:34.470
Satyam: that's the whole.

351
00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:37.200
Satyam: No thanks thanks a lot.

352
00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:39.180
Faculty Office Hours: Okay anybody else have a question.

353
00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:45.810
Connors, Ryan: Professor if this is Ryan.

354
00:47:46.440 --> 00:48:01.710
Connors, Ryan: hi Ryan hey I was just wondering, you know i've been using SAS enterprise guide, as opposed to SAS studio I just find the interface is a little bit better and I don't have any connectivity issues you have any opinion on using that as a platform, as opposed to SAS studio.

355
00:48:03.150 --> 00:48:07.110
Faculty Office Hours: I have taught classes, where people have used enterprise guide and.

356
00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:16.170
Faculty Office Hours: There didn't they didn't run into any difficulties it's just that it's i've had have had difficulties kind of.

357
00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.710
Faculty Office Hours: Reading and understanding their output in some cases.

358
00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:24.810
Connors, Ryan: OK.

359
00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:28.740
Faculty Office Hours: I see, so I may not be able to help you as well, because I don't use that.

360
00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:30.480
Connors, Ryan: Guy okay.

361
00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.940
Faculty Office Hours: i'm not saying that you shouldn't use it i'm just saying that.

362
00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:43.620
Faculty Office Hours: Just make sure that if you have a question or something that you send me the files that I can actually use outside of enterprise guide.

363
00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:45.600
Connors, Ryan: Okay.

364
00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:49.020
Faculty Office Hours: You know, just like just the SAS files and not something else, like around.

365
00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:49.380
Connors, Ryan: Right.

366
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:53.970
Faculty Office Hours: yeah because if you send me a project i'll like spend hours trying to figure out how to unpack it.

367
00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:58.080
Connors, Ryan: Right yeah I think you can save it as a project file or the program file.

368
00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:00.840
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so just just as a SAS Program.

369
00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:13.590
Faculty Office Hours: But yeah it's fine if you want to use an enterprise guide I don't have I don't know of any good references that combine this particular SAS procedure and enterprise guide.

370
00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:14.700
Connors, Ryan: and

371
00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:17.430
Faculty Office Hours: You might Google it there might be something out there, I don't know about.

372
00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:23.100
Connors, Ryan: Okay, all right i'll stick with it for now yeah maybe it would make sense to do that long term.

373
00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:29.430
Faculty Office Hours: But I think really the future First, as far as fast as concern really is SAS studio.

374
00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:30.720
Okay.

375
00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.300
Faculty Office Hours: But it's.

376
00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.650
Connors, Ryan: it's right enterprise guy just.

377
00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:43.800
Faculty Office Hours: What i've heard so it might it might be a might not be a bad idea, just to to to get a little bit more comfortable with it for the future.

378
00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:46.140
Connors, Ryan: All right, that makes sense.

379
00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:48.330
Connors, Ryan: Alright, well, thank you.

380
00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:49.410
Okay.

381
00:49:51.240 --> 00:50:00.510
Jim Clark: Okay, this is Jim and I have found the screen now looking for so i'll share is is on is called frontline solvers or solver.com.

382
00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:05.160
Faculty Office Hours: Right you're trying to access the the the more powerful solver.

383
00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:06.750
Jim Clark: and

384
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:16.920
Jim Clark: Yes, and and but that's not what a third of the mystery of for myself, but, but if it was one of the lines that you put in the code.

385
00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:27.900
Jim Clark: And you click on the get the homepage and something called frontline frontline solvers, and so I thought Oh, I need to do this, but, as you said that that necessary so that.

386
00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:40.980
Faculty Office Hours: So let me um, let me just troubleshoot that, let me troubleshoot the program it may have maybe they changed the way they licensed that and and that's why it's not working now used to be.

387
00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:48.720
Faculty Office Hours: Like I said on a page that I sent you they used to include the up to 200 decision variables for free.

388
00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:53.280
Faculty Office Hours: But but i'll look into that and i'll get back to you on that.

389
00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:54.720
Jim Clark: If I said to start.

390
00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:55.950
The main project.

391
00:50:57.150 --> 00:51:04.800
Faculty Office Hours: right because because some people feel more comfortable working in spreadsheets I thought I would include that yeah I.

392
00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:07.920
Jim Clark: just say like so that's That was the source of my questions.

393
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:09.750
Faculty Office Hours: Is Jonas.

394
00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:21.510
Faculty Office Hours: anybody else had a question or we're just lurking.

395
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:25.530
Christian Gover: I got a question it's me again Christian.

396
00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:38.490
Christian Gover: Okay, so I saw like in was it a some exercise assignment a exercise three, but this was a previous assignment right from another class.

397
00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:45.870
Christian Gover: Sure, let me, let me share my screen, because I was wondering what the difference was between these two syntax lines.

398
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.500
Okay.

399
00:51:50.310 --> 00:51:51.630
Christian Gover: This here.

400
00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:57.540
Christian Gover: And the one line, six and seven I guess there's this INEC.

401
00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:02.340
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so so let's um.

402
00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:05.250
Faculty Office Hours: let's see this is.

403
00:52:07.710 --> 00:52:16.860
Faculty Office Hours: It the the the fact that in it is there, instead of n equals the differences that allows you to change it.

404
00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:20.370
Faculty Office Hours: So, so the fair.

405
00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:35.820
Faculty Office Hours: So in this in this, this is an airline's problem, and so you have like economy flights business flights i'm sorry economy seats business seats and premium seats kind of like first class business class and economy class.

406
00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:48.570
Faculty Office Hours: And, depending on what fair class your seat isn't there's a different fair different amount that you pay and that's that's the fair, so you can see that you pay more for premium and you do for economy.

407
00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:53.670
Faculty Office Hours: Is the the.

408
00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:57.150
Faculty Office Hours: The availability.

409
00:52:58.590 --> 00:53:13.620
Faculty Office Hours: You could use n equals there, the only reason that you might use in it is if it's changed, so it may be, if we go down farther in the program let's see what's happened to availability, it might have been in that class that.

410
00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:21.330
Faculty Office Hours: You know, in a in a later exercise they the students were asked to make a change to availability.

411
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:22.380
Okay.

412
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:34.920
Faculty Office Hours: And so that using an it would allow them to do that, whereas just using an equal sign wouldn't, but in this case there's no reason that you would need to use in it, instead of equals, you could just change it to equals.

413
00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:41.160
Christian Gover: Okay that's why I was wondering right because I guess, there was no nothing that was done to availability to.

414
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:42.840
Faculty Office Hours: yeah it just putting.

415
00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:51.030
Faculty Office Hours: That haste error on my part, but yeah you can change it to equals it in this it will make a difference.

416
00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:52.620
Christian Gover: Okay.

417
00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:54.810
Christian Gover: Thank you.

418
00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:58.080
Faculty Office Hours: Okay sure is good question yeah.

419
00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:44.580
yeah yes, no, no, but thank you for answering my question yeah i'm good.

420
00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:47.490
Christian Gover: yeah I think i'm good.

421
00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:49.620
Faculty Office Hours: Okay.

422
00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:56.730
Faculty Office Hours: Is anyone else interested in the excel stuff if I send something to gym I said, someone else or just everyone.

423
00:54:57.450 --> 00:54:58.350
Monica A. Harwig: i'm interested.

424
00:54:58.740 --> 00:54:59.430
Christian Gover: yeah same here.

425
00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:03.420
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, I mean i'll just broadcast it out i'll post it note broadcast button.

426
00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:05.520
Christian Gover: All right, thank you.

427
00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:08.400
Faculty Office Hours: Thank you sure.

428
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:09.720
Kilani, Shadi: that's partner.

429
00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:14.160
Kilani, Shadi: I just made me a questions for confirmation i've been.

430
00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:21.780
Kilani, Shadi: hyper focused on my capstone project and then now i'm kind of trying to read and go over stuff and.

431
00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:24.330
Kilani, Shadi: So for the assignment.

432
00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:40.710
Kilani, Shadi: It struck me is a little bit straightforward on the first question, the one that asks about locating the 2020 on the grid and then just calculating the is it as simple as it sounds, or is it.

433
00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:43.110
Faculty Office Hours: is as simple as it sounds, although.

434
00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:49.110
Faculty Office Hours: It just kind of help people make the connection between the geometry and kind of and the algebra.

435
00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:58.440
Kilani, Shadi: And the second question, you basically have to code and then whatever coordinates you get you would basically indicated on the figure as well right and you're catching the same way.

436
00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:03.150
Kilani, Shadi: I didn't miss anything right because.

437
00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:07.800
Kilani, Shadi: nope Okay, and then the third question we have to model it.

438
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:12.690
Faculty Office Hours: would say don't don't forget to answer the part that says what should they produce.

439
00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:17.040
Kilani, Shadi: Right well isn't that what you get from your solution.

440
00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:27.330
Faculty Office Hours: yeah but but i'm kind of asking you to regurgitate it in the sense that it, it seems obvious in this case, but it's not always.

441
00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:43.770
Faculty Office Hours: What to do and and just printing out the solution is maybe not always as as quite as clear cut so i'm just trying to help you kind of translate that answer into telling the minions what to do.

442
00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:48.540
Kilani, Shadi: Every solution instead of just a mathematical number so you're saying.

443
00:56:48.810 --> 00:56:51.570
Kilani, Shadi: No output, but what what kind of.

444
00:56:52.050 --> 00:56:53.910
Faculty Office Hours: like an action statement do this.

445
00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:57.480
Kilani, Shadi: right that makes sense and then on the third one.

446
00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:02.220
Kilani, Shadi: On the on the third one.

447
00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:08.100
Kilani, Shadi: we're just trying to model this problem after the furniture that's what I understood.

448
00:57:08.850 --> 00:57:11.880
Faculty Office Hours: Right so after the furniture arrays.

449
00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:22.290
Kilani, Shadi: Right and it's not as complex, because you just get the net cost right, so you just have to structure it a little bit different or a little bit.

450
00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:26.670
Faculty Office Hours: So there's some elements that are going to be a little bit different, but most of it is the same.

451
00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:36.270
Kilani, Shadi: Okay, I don't know, I was overwhelmed initially, but then now when I went at it again, I was like Okay, I just want to make sure it's not a you know I.

452
00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:45.690
Faculty Office Hours: Think when you get to when it becomes more specific it's a little bit easier in kind of generality it's it seems a little overwhelming.

453
00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:47.340
Kilani, Shadi: that's.

454
00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:50.250
Faculty Office Hours: A lot of syntax, but when you got to kind of get down to it.

455
00:57:50.550 --> 00:58:01.260
Faculty Office Hours: Especially if you get down to a problem that is one that you really want to solve that that's when it's easiest to learn, but unfortunately I can't like.

456
00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:05.280
Faculty Office Hours: I can't get a problem that everybody.

457
00:58:06.570 --> 00:58:09.330
Faculty Office Hours: You know, is going to solve in their in their job.

458
00:58:11.010 --> 00:58:11.790
Kilani, Shadi: That makes sense.

459
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.640
Faculty Office Hours: So, like when we get when we get to like reading data.

460
00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:31.830
Faculty Office Hours: For for for in general it's going to seem kind of abstract, but if you pick a problem that you might think of in in your work that might be solved by an optimization approach and say okay for this problem, what does the data look like and how would I read in that it becomes.

461
00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:42.390
Faculty Office Hours: Just that more could you understand the setting and it and it becomes Okay, how can I make the syntax work and you don't have to understand the artificial setting and the syntax.

462
00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:45.420
Kilani, Shadi: Because it's more relevant right because.

463
00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:47.910
Faculty Office Hours: Because you're familiar with.

464
00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:50.910
Faculty Office Hours: You know the numbers and all that stuff.

465
00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:54.570
Kilani, Shadi: Well, thank you very much.

466
00:58:56.190 --> 00:58:58.410
Kilani, Shadi: appreciate your input and your answers, thank you.

467
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.830
Faculty Office Hours: yeah and.

468
00:58:58.890 --> 00:59:00.600
Faculty Office Hours: Like I said, if you run into any.

469
00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:10.020
Faculty Office Hours: Any problems just email me with your your program code, and let me know what kind of errors you're getting and I can try to help you work through it.

470
00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:14.910
Kilani, Shadi: So I would send you the Code and the log or just the code or.

471
00:59:14.970 --> 00:59:19.740
Faculty Office Hours: You can send me the code in the log would be helpful, but I can always take your code and run it.

472
00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:25.320
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, when I get into problems is when like people will send me.

473
00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:27.990
Faculty Office Hours: The part of the code that's not working.

474
00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:32.490
Faculty Office Hours: So that I can't run the program don't have the Program.

475
00:59:35.370 --> 00:59:44.040
Faculty Office Hours: Then the log can sometimes you know, answer the question without having to see the whole program but yeah you send me the whole program I should be able to run it.

476
00:59:44.850 --> 00:59:46.770
Kilani, Shadi: Yes, Sir, thank you, thank you yep.

477
01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.280
Kilani, Shadi: that's it for me i'm good Thank you so.

478
01:00:02.730 --> 01:00:03.600

Kilani, Shadi: And online you don't get the.

484
01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:52.230
Kilani, Shadi: same you know rewarding feeling when you talk to somebody and then you see them understanding what you're kind of talking about and you just assume Okay, they got what i'm saying, and then you just have to move on and then any questions and then you get this silence.

485
01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:53.670
Kilani, Shadi: If anything.

486
01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:55.920

487
01:00:56.370 --> 01:01:09.540
Faculty Office Hours: ya know I I still haven't really gotten used to to the to the zoom meetings and so forth, you just you just can't wrap people on the on the risk of the ruler on online such takes all the fun out of it.

yeah.

489
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:14.820
Kilani, Shadi: It was that in an action portion of things and.

490
01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:20.190
Kilani, Shadi: it's not the same, even if people open up their cameras and it's just not the same.

491
01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:26.460
Faculty Office Hours: gotta kind of like walk up and down the aisles and like look and see who's having problems and stuff like that yeah.

Faculty Office Hours: What do you teach.

493
01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:38.070

495
01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:53.190
Faculty Office Hours: Yes, I am well she's an epidemiologist she doesn't do clinical practice anymore, but I made it through high school biology like I know where some of my major organs are but that's about it.

496
01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:57.180
Kilani, Shadi: close enough that's good.
