1
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.070
Faculty Office Hours: either.

2
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.850
Christian Gover: Professor how are you.

3
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.670
Faculty Office Hours: doing all right i'm just grateful that our office hours don't interfere with the game tonight.

4
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.720
Christian Gover: Oh yeah yeah that's I wanted you to go all the way, but now unfortunately they didn't so.

5
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.060
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I wasn't too sure about how Texas, and then people would feel about you ah, but I guess it's all good huh.

6
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.450
Christian Gover: yeah yeah well my case is interesting, I went to ut Austin for my undergrad so.

7
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.820
Christian Gover: So my capstones tomorrow.

8
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.320
Faculty Office Hours: i'll be a relief to get that done wanna.

9
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.310
yeah.

10
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.710
Faculty Office Hours: You got any specific questions or just going to kind of lurk.

11
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:52.740
Christian Gover: yeah yeah I do I guess question five stop me, so I wasn't too sure about that one.

12
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:05.370
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so which part of that the the kind of the the changes and producing the results are the explaining part we're both.

13
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:15.450
Christian Gover: I think both probably i'm not sure if i'm doing it correctly honestly I, I guess, I did set set the constraint to zero.

14
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.980
Christian Gover: yeah I guess the coefficients are supposed to be the same as the.

15
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.830
Faculty Office Hours: What why don't you show me what you've done.

16
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.920
Christian Gover: Oh okay all right, let me share.

17
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.640
Christian Gover: Okay um yeah let me open up SAS here yeah.

18
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:45.930
Christian Gover: So I mean do we want to talk about the question first maybe how I interpreted it.

19
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.750
Faculty Office Hours: I will show me what you.

20
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.880
Christian Gover: Just the output.

21
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.870
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

22
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.880
Christian Gover: All right, let me run this.

23
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.810
Faculty Office Hours: I was thinking more of the code, but we can.

24
00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.790
Christian Gover: yeah yeah.

25
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:14.190
Christian Gover: So I mean I think what what it wants, is to make sure that the dual matches with some kind of function that I specify in my code.

26
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.750
Christian Gover: Right.

27
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.390
Faculty Office Hours: So will.

28
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.610
Faculty Office Hours: I code, so I wanted to verify that the that the dual.

29
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.900
Faculty Office Hours: values that you print are the same as the ones in the homework assignment, the ones that are listed there.

30
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.840
Faculty Office Hours: was a tape there's a table in in the homework assignment.

31
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.080
Faculty Office Hours: In the in the kind of preamble part.

32
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:48.390
Faculty Office Hours: there's that table yeah and so, basically, the first part is yours verifying that those are the same values.

33
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.520
Christian Gover: All these right here.

34
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.710
Christian Gover: hmm let's see.

35
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.960
Christian Gover: Is that what they look like.

36
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.750
Faculty Office Hours: look pretty much like that you could check one or two, probably as good enough.

37
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:06.120
Christian Gover: For this.

38
00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:07.110
Faculty Office Hours: very week.

39
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.840
Christian Gover: 704370 4.494 week.

40
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.210
Faculty Office Hours: yeah looks like you're a winner here.

41
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.000
Faculty Office Hours: So what you're doing is you're kind of.

42
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.030
Faculty Office Hours: That they've done they've done the calculations, you could do the same calculations yourself and.

43
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:34.560
Faculty Office Hours: And so I mean it's it's going to be the the revenue less the costs less the.

44
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.810
Faculty Office Hours: fixed costs.

45
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.850
Faculty Office Hours: So you can do the calculation yourself.

46
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:46.650
Faculty Office Hours: Basically, just verifying that what what you have is correct, so let's see what So what is it that you that you're calculating they're.

47
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.270
Christian Gover: selling price minus fixed costs minus all the.

48
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.170
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so see you realize that you can.

49
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.950
Faculty Office Hours: there's a way to express that using a son.

50
00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.400
Christian Gover: Okay, I didn't know that.

51
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:09.480
Faculty Office Hours: So the whole the whole advantage, the sum is that you don't have to write out a lot of terms like that.

52
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.170
Christian Gover: yeah.

53
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.600
Faculty Office Hours: You could you could write that out as.

54
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.270
Faculty Office Hours: Some.

55
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:16.800
Christian Gover: Maybe I.

56
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.960
Faculty Office Hours: heard so let's see what exactly is that your listing it looks like you're listing resources right.

57
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.660
Christian Gover: Right, the required I guess it's just, you have the resources right.

58
00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:40.740
Faculty Office Hours: The the purple things are all all members of the set of resources, so you could say some over our and resources and then you could just say cost of our time is required of P calm are.

59
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:43.320
Christian Gover: Okay.

60
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:51.990
Faculty Office Hours: So we've got if you if you just move up a couple of lines you probably got some expressions like that and they're already in different places.

61
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.340
Christian Gover: In ministry here yeah.

62
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.830
Faculty Office Hours: yeah yeah so that's The total cost.

63
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.630
Christian Gover: All right, i'll try that out, then.

64
00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:07.170
Faculty Office Hours: Instead of since it looks like the first part you got you verified that they're the same same numbers, as there are in the table.

65
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:13.890
Faculty Office Hours: Right um but then I guess the other part of it is, is why.

66
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:23.190
Christian Gover: yeah that's I wasn't too sure I mean I was looking at the video, and I did see you know this kind of formula here for dual dual values.

67
00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:32.370
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so let's let's look at that and think about it so So what is the what is the constraint limit that you would be increasing by one.

68
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:37.260
Faculty Office Hours: Go back into your code.

69
00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:41.550
Christian Gover: I think you're looking at net profit over demand right.

70
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:47.670
Faculty Office Hours: Well, net profit over let's just look at the constraints.

71
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.860
Faculty Office Hours: So that show me the constraints that you're printing the dual values of in your code.

72
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:57.180
Christian Gover: yeah let me.

73
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.370
Christian Gover: Strange strains here.

74
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.350
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so so.

75
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.830
Faculty Office Hours: The limit right now is zero right.

76
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:09.390
Christian Gover: Right.

77
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.030
Faculty Office Hours: The What would it mean if you change the limit to one.

78
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.010
Christian Gover: well.

79
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.460
Faculty Office Hours: What would that allow you to do for just one of the products.

80
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.540
Christian Gover: If I increase the limit to one.

81
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:32.130
Christian Gover: I guess I could just produced one I guess.

82
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.940
Faculty Office Hours: One other so So if you if you produce one.

83
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:43.620
Faculty Office Hours: yeah What would the What would the What would the changing the objective be from producing one.

84
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:46.980
Christian Gover: objective.

85
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.590
Christian Gover: So.

86
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.150
Christian Gover: Much.

87
00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:00.900
Christian Gover: It but yeah I mean so like you're saying, for all of these products right if you increase it to wine.

88
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.350
Christian Gover: right that would go.

89
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:09.450
Christian Gover: I mean I don't think that the man would go up just because you increase the.

90
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:20.220
Faculty Office Hours: I mean you're not training you're not touching demand it's just a question of So if you produce one batch of berry wheat mm hmm.

91
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:25.710
Faculty Office Hours: How would how much, would you expect the net profit to increase.

92
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.600
Faculty Office Hours: could be, what is your table, perhaps.

93
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.890
Christian Gover: yeah I guess it would be this.

94
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.580
Christian Gover: 34.

95
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.720
Faculty Office Hours: And why.

96
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.490
Christian Gover: Is it that the dual value.

97
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:52.290
Faculty Office Hours: Well, not so much that it's the dual value look over one column, where you do your calculations, you get the same number right.

98
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.920
Faculty Office Hours: how'd you calculate that.

99
00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.490
Christian Gover: Just yeah using the.

100
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.250
Christian Gover: The revenue minus the cost right.

101
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.000
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so it's basically the objective function coefficient right.

102
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:10.620
Christian Gover: yeah.

103
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.160
Faculty Office Hours: And, and that and that objective function coefficient tells you.

104
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.200
Faculty Office Hours: How much.

105
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:23.340
Faculty Office Hours: One batch of very weak contributes to the net profit right.

106
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.450
Christian Gover: yeah.

107
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:30.690
Faculty Office Hours: So I mean I that that's really that's that's all i'm looking for is is just that he realized that.

108
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:38.130
Faculty Office Hours: Changing the limit by one means you can produce one unit and.

109
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:44.910
Faculty Office Hours: The thing that you calculated tells you how how much contributes that profit.

110
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:59.790
Christian Gover: Okay yeah cuz I wasn't sure if if we had to do that because I was thinking it we're just changing it I didn't think we were setting the increasing it by one in here but.

111
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:05.130
Christian Gover: yeah.

112
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:11.460
Faculty Office Hours: So I think I think I think you're I think you pretty well got it there okay.

113
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.830
Christian Gover: Alright, that sounds good.

114
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:28.800
Faculty Office Hours: yeah just a question of kind of trend turn it to put the trying to apply the thing in the box to your to this specific case and kind of putting it into words that that's just that's all i'm looking for.

115
00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.920
Christian Gover: Okay, good.

116
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.620
Christian Gover: Pretty straightforward, thank you.

117
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:36.990
Faculty Office Hours: Thank you for sharing now.

118
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.850
Faculty Office Hours: anybody else have a question.

119
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:44.910
Faculty Office Hours: I suspect that's why you're here.

120
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.500
Stephanie Pollock: yeah I do I realized, I was off mute the whole time.

121
00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.930
Stephanie Pollock: I had a question about number two.

122
00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:58.950
When.

123
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:04.440
Stephanie Pollock: when trying to increase the.

124
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:12.960
Stephanie Pollock: Increasing the Labor the brewing lever over time to $27 an hour.

125
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.330
Stephanie Pollock: And to use the.

126
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:26.010
Stephanie Pollock: The furniture example, but I just I don't know if i'm missing something in my code or what's going on, oh so.

127
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:31.140
Faculty Office Hours: So all you really need to do to answer that question is to know the the dual value.

128
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:33.570
Okay.

129
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:39.990
Faculty Office Hours: And so, for the furniture making problem, the dual value was 1.3 what.

130
00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:45.870
Faculty Office Hours: From from your from your results what what is the dual value of brewing Labor.

131
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.860
Stephanie Pollock: Sorry hang on my code suddenly isn't working.

132
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.070
Faculty Office Hours: Are you getting an error.

133
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.310
Stephanie Pollock: yeah, but it was working last night so.

134
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.160
Faculty Office Hours: What what's what is that you want to share.

135
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.780
Stephanie Pollock: yeah i'll share.

136
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:34.950
Faculty Office Hours: So show the log Where are you getting are you getting an error.

137
00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.230
Stephanie Pollock: yeah.

138
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.530
Faculty Office Hours: i'll just show the log just yeah.

139
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:42.930
Stephanie Pollock: for whatever reason it's.

140
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:48.810
Faculty Office Hours: Oh so you're doing the thing that I always do, which is somehow you had something highlighted kind of by accident.

141
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.640
Stephanie Pollock: Oh, maybe oh yeah.

142
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:53.220
Faculty Office Hours: If you just put your cursor somewhere else, then try it again.

143
00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:55.170
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

144
00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.920
Faculty Office Hours: that's kind of annoying but yet does that okay now what.

145
00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.210
Faculty Office Hours: Do you from there right.

146
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.620
Stephanie Pollock: Do you have to recreate these libraries, every time you open.

147
00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.730
Faculty Office Hours: A not a few check that box that says recreate the library.

148
00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.450
Stephanie Pollock: Okay, I didn't that's why.

149
00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.520
Stephanie Pollock: All right, give me.

150
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.620
Faculty Office Hours: just looking for extra practice that's good.

151
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.400
Right.

152
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:21.930
Okay.

153
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:32.760
Stephanie Pollock: Okay, so bring Labor here 36.

154
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:45.600
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so so that that number says that if you had more brewing Labor available at the current price, you could increase your objective by that much.

155
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.180
Stephanie Pollock: Okay, I.

156
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.180
Stephanie Pollock: So I thought.

157
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:59.670
Stephanie Pollock: Exercise one if additional overtime of bring Labor is available for $27 an hour.

158
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:09.990
Stephanie Pollock: Using additional overtime brain Labor allow them to increase that profit so, then the answer I guess would be yes.

159
00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.350
Faculty Office Hours: So, so what what are you comparing that number two, though.

160
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.850
Stephanie Pollock: That 27 to 36.

161
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.530
Faculty Office Hours: That would that would give you the right answer, but that would be the wrong thing to compare.

162
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:36.000
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so let's think about the the example at the furniture making problem, so the dual value was was pretty small it was 1.3, but what we compared to the 1.3 was not.

163
00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:43.380
Faculty Office Hours: $21 an hour, it was the additional cost.

164
00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:48.630
Faculty Office Hours: Of the overtime Labor which, in that case was seven.

165
00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:53.370
Stephanie Pollock: Okay, so it'd be nine in this case.

166
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.130
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so it's even it's even more attractive.

167
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:57.870
Stephanie Pollock: yeah okay.

168
00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:00.600
Stephanie Pollock: Okay, great.

169
00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.390
Stephanie Pollock: And that was that was my only question.

170
00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:12.600
Faculty Office Hours: So it's the same it's the same setting the numbers are different, and in this case, the conclusion is different, but it's all the same.

171
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:19.050
Faculty Office Hours: we're comparing the the dual value to.

172
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.420
Faculty Office Hours: To a cost.

173
00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.840
Stephanie Pollock: Okay, that makes sense.

174
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.300
Faculty Office Hours: Good one or is that are you.

175
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.260
Stephanie Pollock: that's it for now.

176
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.300
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, well, if you.

177
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:37.440
Faculty Office Hours: If you have questions later in the week just send me an email it's fine.

178
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:38.520
Stephanie Pollock: Thank you.

179
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:39.360
mm hmm.

180
00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.960
Faculty Office Hours: David looks like you're outside there.

181
00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:56.520
Faculty Office Hours: You know, you know revealing too much by like showing us the type of vegetation in the area where you are or anything, are you.

182
00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:57.570
Purkiss, David: Now I don't think so.

183
00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.520
Faculty Office Hours: that's that's a fake right it's just a.

184
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.810
Faculty Office Hours: cardboard cutout.

185
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.860
it's a backdrop.

186
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.670
Faculty Office Hours: What uh what does anyone have a question or.

187
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:18.270
Purkiss, David: I actually I i've just barely gotten started on and I just wanted to get some insight from what other people were struggling and hopefully I get this done by Thursday.

188
00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.350
Okay.

189
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.080
Faculty Office Hours: Jimmy got some more is that that describes the situation to.

190
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:44.820
Jim Clark: Yet situation, I think I have a handle on or four and I ran out of energy last night and so now i'm going to work with five or six but since it's Monday night i'm probably not going to struggle, this one is I did so.

191
00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:51.390
Jim Clark: silly wish I was just listening to to the chatter and talk to me it sounds like.

192
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:59.970
Jim Clark: I got I got some validation so then maybe maybe some of the things I do kind of made sense so it's.

193
00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.500
Jim Clark: it's getting there it's just having just having to work through the problem.

194
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.480
Faculty Office Hours: Okay anybody else.

195
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.770
Like everybody else's music.

196
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.200
Faculty Office Hours: Yes, you and me, Jim.

197
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:21.150
Jim Clark: But I think it with that Satan arm you start working on Problem number five.

198
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:31.680
Jim Clark: But because it because I don't I haven't looked at it enough to even ask the question that i'd have to say i'm stuck on this, I have no.

199
00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:32.940
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, I got you.

200
00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:42.930
Jim Clark: But but but I appreciate you willis office hours and and I will I will wait till Thursday morning lunch brother knows that.

201
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:49.140
Faculty Office Hours: Okay yeah so like you know just if you feel like you're putting too much time into it it's probably do something simple that.

202
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.310
Faculty Office Hours: It will be better just to fire off an email asked question.

203
00:19:53.700 --> 00:20:05.430
Jim Clark: Now, and tomorrow tomorrow did data to really spend a lot of quality time on this too much than then then i'll probably offer a sense of going out before before losing one.

204
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.230
Faculty Office Hours: Okay.

205
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.290
Jim Clark: Very much sure.

206
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.530
Purkiss, David: So doctor I I I did turn in.

207
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:19.620
Purkiss, David: The last one late.

208
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:30.060
Purkiss, David: And I started on this one and i'm still struggling i'm going back to the lectures and in going through the PowerPoint presentations again.

209
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:40.650
Purkiss, David: And i'm I think i'm gaining some some confidence, but I might send you an email and asked asked to to join the session and early in the morning again.

210
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:42.690
Faculty Office Hours: Sure that's fine OK.

211
00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.860
Purkiss, David: OK OK okay i'll work on it for a little bit first and then.

212
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.580
Faculty Office Hours: Okay.

213
00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:49.020
Purkiss, David: I have some questions.

214
00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.730
Faculty Office Hours: If no one else has any.

215
00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:53.790
Faculty Office Hours: questions I have a slide that I made for someone who.

216
00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:59.700
Faculty Office Hours: Had a questions to me see if I can find it and share it let's see so that it relates to.

217
00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.900
Faculty Office Hours: What we're what we're working on let's see if I can get to it.

218
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.320
None of this looks right that's okay.

219
00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:23.250
Faculty Office Hours: So this is a slide for.

220
00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:32.280
Faculty Office Hours: A second I can just do this only one slide but so a lot of these questions are asking you to predict something.

221
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:39.720
Faculty Office Hours: Right like so something changes in the model and you're trying to predict what the result is.

222
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:50.970
Faculty Office Hours: In the objective, so this this slide is one that I did I developed by I would have liked to have put in the last lecture but I didn't.

223
00:21:52.050 --> 00:22:04.050
Faculty Office Hours: So you see that the red graph is the actual behavior of the way the net profit changes as the budget level changes, but if all you know, is the slope.

224
00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:15.990
Faculty Office Hours: At the point where the dotted line comes up and intersects with the function, then what you would do to predict the change is you would use that slogan you to extend it out to the right and the left.

225
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:24.870
Faculty Office Hours: Because you don't know you know where changes its behavior all you know, is the slope at that point and that's what you use to predict.

226
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.460
Purkiss, David: Net your blue line.

227
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:35.340
Purkiss, David: Right and so, and so it is tangent to the so that would be a red line under the blue line between the two points.

228
00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.890
Faculty Office Hours: yeah there's a red light under there and.

229
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.830
Faculty Office Hours: And the slope of that line is the dual value.

230
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:54.330
Faculty Office Hours: And that's that's how we can predict the change and we don't know a priori if we're in one of those areas where the prediction is exact which would be in this little interval here.

231
00:22:55.050 --> 00:23:06.480
Faculty Office Hours: Or it overestimates the change which could be somewhere to the right or somewhere to the left, but since we don't know anything about how that function behavior those points.

232
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:14.610
Faculty Office Hours: This is our prediction and and we figure if it's a small change we're probably safe, but if it's a big change then.

233
00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:24.480
Faculty Office Hours: Even even though that's the best we can do we probably want to be a little cautious about you know, putting all our marbles in that basket because.

234
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:38.940
Faculty Office Hours: It may not be the right exact answer that's in a couple of places where I said, use the dual values to predict and then modify the model to determine just to see if the prediction is correct.

235
00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:42.570
But.

236
00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:53.340
Jonas Jonas.

237
00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:00.600
Fritz, Joanna: Question on number three.

238
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:11.910
Fritz, Joanna: trouble getting started on it, so I was wondering if you could give me a little bit of the pointer should I share my screen, or should I just.

239
00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.430
Faculty Office Hours: want you can share your screen that's fine.

240
00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:15.600
Okay cool.

241
00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.630
Fritz, Joanna: can't get very far can you see my SAS Program.

242
00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.400
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so.

243
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:31.680
Fritz, Joanna: Okay cool yeah so i'm just so I was able to.

244
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:37.980
Fritz, Joanna: print out the dual values for the demand constraint.

245
00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.930
Fritz, Joanna: Okay, right here.

246
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:44.520
Faculty Office Hours: And so the know in this case we're interested in a specific one of those right.

247
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.530
Fritz, Joanna: Yes, we are interested in the dark ale.

248
00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.410
Fritz, Joanna: Which is right here.

249
00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.190
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so now, if you think back to the graph I just showed.

250
00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.280
Faculty Office Hours: That that value that.

251
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:03.540
Faculty Office Hours: Is the slope of that blue line.

252
00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:17.400
Faculty Office Hours: And so, in order to make a prediction on that line, you need to say Okay, well, I know that at the point where I am right now.

253
00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:21.240
Faculty Office Hours: Where the demand is whatever it is.

254
00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:26.430
Faculty Office Hours: We can look up in the table the demand is 6.2916.

255
00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:43.080
Faculty Office Hours: That, I know that my objective value is the one that's computed as the as the optimal objective value and if I start to change that if I increase the demand, then I expect that the net profit is going to go up.

256
00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.290
Faculty Office Hours: Right, because the slope is positive.

257
00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:51.240
Faculty Office Hours: And if I decrease it, I expect that it's going to go down.

258
00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:58.560
Faculty Office Hours: In order to predict how much it goes up or down I need to multiply the change.

259
00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:05.070
Faculty Office Hours: In the limit, which is the demand times the dual value.

260
00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:16.440
Faculty Office Hours: That makes sense because the dual value tells how much it will go up or down by a if you change it by one one unit.

261
00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:19.320
Fritz, Joanna: Yes, okay.

262
00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:22.380
Faculty Office Hours: Please one unit corresponds to one batch.

263
00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:29.790
Faculty Office Hours: So what how much would it change if you if you decrease it by 10%.

264
00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:36.240
Fritz, Joanna: Be 9.8 to.

265
00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:46.890
Faculty Office Hours: Know i'm just asking how much how much change the demand change that went down by 10%.

266
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.480
Fritz, Joanna: And just if the dark or so.

267
00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:04.680
Faculty Office Hours: what's the demand for dark you probably got that table hanging around up there somewhere let's see probably up above.

268
00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.790
Fritz, Joanna: right here okay.

269
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:13.290
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so what if that went down by 10% how much would it go down by.

270
00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.450
Fritz, Joanna: And Point six three.

271
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:25.110
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, and so that's that's that's kind of the delta that we're looking for.

272
00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.580
Faculty Office Hours: Right so so that the slope measures, the rise over the run.

273
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:37.500
Faculty Office Hours: So the run, then, is a change in the dark ALE and the rise is what we're going to predict.

274
00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:42.450
Faculty Office Hours: So we're going to take the change and multiply it by the dual value.

275
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.210
Fritz, Joanna: Okay.

276
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:51.180
Faculty Office Hours: So the dual values work with absolute changes in the demand in this case.

277
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.360
Fritz, Joanna: Okay.

278
00:27:54.540 --> 00:28:00.210
Faculty Office Hours: So you got to go from percentage to absolute change and then take that to the dual value.

279
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:02.970
Fritz, Joanna: Okay.

280
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:20.160
Fritz, Joanna: Okay, so a nice sorry I just said, to confirm, so the slope and the rise is going to be what you're predicting.

281
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:33.540
Faculty Office Hours: yep so so like what you're predicting over Point six three is equal to the dual value Okay, so what you're trying to predict is going to be the dual value times the change.

282
00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.090
Faculty Office Hours: Which is point six three.

283
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:42.360
Purkiss, David: X three times the i'm sorry for interjecting but i'm learning a lot.

284
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.680
Purkiss, David: Point six three times the dual value then.

285
00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:49.860
Faculty Office Hours: yeah which is like nine something rather.

286
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:57.690
Faculty Office Hours: So if went down by a whole batch it would go down by nine whatever.

287
00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:06.720
Faculty Office Hours: But it's not going to go down by a whole batch it's going to go down by about you know, two thirds of the batch.

288
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:17.940
Fritz, Joanna: Okay, so, then you take the point six three times this value.

289
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:18.720
uh huh.

290
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:20.820
Fritz, Joanna: Okay.

291
00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:23.220
Faculty Office Hours: And if you if you're still not.

292
00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:28.590
Faculty Office Hours: Solid on on on what's going on just draw a little graph.

293
00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:31.140
Faculty Office Hours: You know just draw the.

294
00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:39.150
Faculty Office Hours: draw the graph where you know that the dotted line is that the the value of the demand.

295
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:48.810
Faculty Office Hours: And what's what's on the y axis is the net profit and the slope of the line is equal to 92.8.

296
00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:52.680
Fritz, Joanna: Okay.

297
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.940
Faculty Office Hours: i'm just kind of use that to convince yourself that you're doing the right thing.

298
00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.560
Fritz, Joanna: Okay perfect okay i'll give that a try.

299
00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:13.170
Faculty Office Hours: Sure yeah and that's that's utility of the dual values that that is that they tell you how the model would behave if you change some of the limits without you having to rerun it.

300
00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:26.010
Faculty Office Hours: So you can kind of like think imagine yourself going into a meeting with like just the dual values written down on a piece of paper and then says someone says, well, what is this and you could say, well, I think this would be the result.

301
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:35.010
Faculty Office Hours: Instead of having to like go in there and type changes to your model and run it again, you can just kind of do a back of the envelope calculation.

302
00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:51.960
Fritz, Joanna: Okay cool also I was wondering, and so, you said that like with small changes this gives you a pretty good idea is that probably relative to each problem you're solving or is there, like a rule of thumb.

303
00:30:53.460 --> 00:31:02.160
Faculty Office Hours: Well, so the the The difficulty is is we don't know where we are in that interval how far it extends to the Left and the Right.

304
00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:24.690
Faculty Office Hours: it's it's kind of a it's kind of a crapshoot so so small and large changes is not relative to the model it's just kind of common sense there's no there's no absolute you know I can't I can't tell you that 10% changes small and a 50% chance changes large.

305
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:32.550
Faculty Office Hours: You just you just kind of if you were changing it by 50% you'd say, well, that was definitely large right.

306
00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.160
Faculty Office Hours: But 10% might be large too.

307
00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:37.500
Fritz, Joanna: So.

308
00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:39.330
Faculty Office Hours: You can't.

309
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:47.160
Faculty Office Hours: You can't easily calculate the how much you can push the right of the left.

310
00:31:49.050 --> 00:32:03.960
Faculty Office Hours: it's not hard to code it up and run run a run a program to calculate that but it's not something that you can into it from how big the model is or you know how many constraints are or anything like that.

311
00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.230
Fritz, Joanna: Okay, that makes sense, thank you.

312
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:52.800
Faculty Office Hours: So, David, what do you think about those commercials where they kind of try and glorify the roles that people play in the I think it's the army, the army has this recruitment commercial where they have like you know everyone has their superpower.

313
00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:59.010
Faculty Office Hours: Like even the even the even the cook you know he's like slicing things that are flying through the air and.

314
00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:01.590
Purkiss, David: I haven't seen that one yet.

315
00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:02.730
Oh, and so.

316
00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:12.090
Faculty Office Hours: They definitely put a lot of money into that commercial there's a lot of cgi going on in there, but he's still slice and potatoes, even though they're flying through the air.

317
00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:20.700
Purkiss, David: I saw one recently that was pretty I thought pretty pretty motivational but I didn't see that one yet.

318
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:32.250
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I think they have like someone who does logistics someone who's in like food service and someone who's in communications, you know they'd like.

319
00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:39.090
Faculty Office Hours: She they're not your traditional like warrior roles, but they're trying to make them seem really.

320
00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:46.200
Faculty Office Hours: You know, like, I understand everybody's job is important, but just the same, I mean KPMG kp.

321
00:33:56.970 --> 00:34:03.600
Purkiss, David: Well, I think i've gained what I can I appreciate it and i'll be in touch if I need more help Professor Thank you so much.

322
00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:05.310
Faculty Office Hours: yeah no problem okay.

323
00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:05.880
Purkiss, David: Take care.

324
00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:06.750
Faculty Office Hours: All right.

325
00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:05.820
Faculty Office Hours: hey travis how are you.

326
00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:09.120
Travis Smith: doing well, how are you today.

327
00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.320
Faculty Office Hours: i'm doing fine.

328
00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.780
Faculty Office Hours: i'm good I just watch the game tonight, but.

329
00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:15.360
Travis Smith: Be rooting for.

330
00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:20.250
Faculty Office Hours: i'm rooting for Gonzaga I think it's I think it's it's their turn.

331
00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:28.710
Travis Smith: I agree, I also just don't like baylor I work in higher ED and i'm tired of all the different laws that I have to worry about now because of them so.

332
00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:34.770
Travis Smith: But yeah i'm hoping to what time does a game start.

333
00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:38.010
Faculty Office Hours: I think it starts at eight something.

334
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:43.200
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, I don't know if eight is like when the hype starts, you know it's always a.

335
00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:47.400
Faculty Office Hours: lot of lot of fluff at the beginning.

336
00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.880
Faculty Office Hours: What, what can I, what can I help you with.

337
00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:57.630
Travis Smith: So really I am i'm kind of tripped up on question sex.

338
00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:00.000
Travis Smith: And I get the question.

339
00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:06.060
Travis Smith: And I will a little bit of background about me I didn't start coding until I entered into this program.

340
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:09.690
Travis Smith: No, I feel that i'm still pretty early on in my coding experience.

341
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:24.810
Travis Smith: um and I get what the questions asking I believe in that it's basically you're trying to do a massive change on the entire set which is grains and hops, but for some reason it's just not connecting i'm what i'm needing to do with that.

342
00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:25.680
Faculty Office Hours: Okay.

343
00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:26.310
Travis Smith: I know that just.

344
00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.260
Faculty Office Hours: joined a shirt code.

345
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:29.640
i'm.

346
00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.660
Travis Smith: i'm on a different I haven't actually with the screen up here because.

347
00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:38.580
Travis Smith: Okay i'm used to the office hours going up here and then I could follow along on my laptop so.

348
00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.200
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so let's say.

349
00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:44.130
Faculty Office Hours: Would you know how to change just one of them.

350
00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:50.190
Faculty Office Hours: Like let's say I pick a particular grain or hop out, would you know how to change that one.

351
00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:53.370
Travis Smith: Yes, I can change the one individually.

352
00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.580
Travis Smith: And I didn't want to go in and change each one.

353
00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:56.940
Faculty Office Hours: sure.

354
00:39:56.970 --> 00:40:00.150
Travis Smith: Sure, I thought that the point of it would be to change them all.

355
00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:00.450
So.

356
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:07.890
Faculty Office Hours: So in prakash model we talked in the last lecture about some simple control flow.

357
00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:19.410
Faculty Office Hours: mm hmm and the the main structure that we looked at was a kind of a loop, and it was this the statement is called it for statement.

358
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.000
Travis Smith: mm hmm.

359
00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:41.460
Faculty Office Hours: And so, for some, one of the examples I used I calculated the distances between customers and factories, so I kind of looped over the customers and looped over the factories and then I calculated a distance between them.

360
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:43.470
Travis Smith: Okay, let me.

361
00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:51.060
Faculty Office Hours: Just kind of similar to what you want to do in this instance, but what you've got is a little bit simpler.

362
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:57.120
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, but the forest statement is how we do loops in prakash model okay.

363
00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:00.360
Travis Smith: So the fourth segment is more okay.

364
00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:12.630
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so so the syntax goes like four and then you want you want to figure out okay what set do I want to loop over so what's that would make sense in this context.

365
00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:17.760
Travis Smith: So then, this context the set that's already been established, would be the grains and the hops.

366
00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:23.550
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so, then in order to loop over that set you need what we call a local dummy parameter.

367
00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.350
Faculty Office Hours: Alright, which is typically just a letter.

368
00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:31.860
Travis Smith: Okay.

369
00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.650
Faculty Office Hours: And you get to choose what that letter is.

370
00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.080
Faculty Office Hours: Right you don't have to reveal to anyone else.

371
00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.800
Faculty Office Hours: Until you have in your homework assignment anyway.

372
00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:51.360
Faculty Office Hours: And let's let's say you choose K okay so you'd say for K in, and then the name of the set which be grains and hops.

373
00:41:52.800 --> 00:42:12.060
Faculty Office Hours: And then, whatever statement comes next is executed for every value of K on the set and and that statement that you're going to have instead of changing an individual one changes that kind of generically using the name K.

374
00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:13.470
Travis Smith: Okay.

375
00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:14.220
I say.

376
00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:17.520
Travis Smith: Okay.

377
00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:23.640
Faculty Office Hours: So there's a couple of places, you can look for examples, one of them is when we looped over.

378
00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:28.350
Faculty Office Hours: origins and destinations for factories and customers.

379
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:31.410
Faculty Office Hours: There was another one where we calculated.

380
00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:35.220
Faculty Office Hours: We calculated bounds on the most.

381
00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:49.830
Faculty Office Hours: of each product that we could make so the most tables, the most i'm sorry the most desks, the most chairs the most bookcases the most bed frames, that was a simpler loop and more similar to what you're looking for in this case.

382
00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:50.550
Travis Smith: Okay.

383
00:42:50.880 --> 00:43:01.770
Faculty Office Hours: So we did we just kind of looped over all the products, and then we did a calculation and that calculation referred to kind of generic product as described by the local dummy parameter.

384
00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:05.520
Travis Smith: Okay, no, I think I get it now, I think I see.

385
00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:06.480
Travis Smith: ya why.

386
00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:16.950
Faculty Office Hours: it's referring almost every programming language has like these basic structures of loops and conditional statements it's just that the way the syntax is.

387
00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:21.330
Faculty Office Hours: kind of rolls out is different for every language.

388
00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:29.610
Faculty Office Hours: Right, but so kind of coding is is there's nothing like no one's inventing.

389
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:34.590
Faculty Office Hours: New coding structures it's all just.

390
00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:43.500
Faculty Office Hours: it's all the recycling, the same stuff, although there are some very clever data structures that you can use.

391
00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:45.840
Faculty Office Hours: very efficiently.

392
00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:50.670
Travis Smith: i'll say that i've been able to pick up on SAS quicker than I was able to pick up on Python.

393
00:43:51.660 --> 00:44:04.260
Travis Smith: But it was just the subtle differences like thinking of this as a loop, as opposed to a loop that's constantly going in operating if that makes sense, and so this This makes sense now, so thank you.

394
00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:07.290
Faculty Office Hours: I know, absolutely no Python at all.

395
00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:10.320
Faculty Office Hours: I think Python is a snake if that tells you.

396
00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:25.770
Faculty Office Hours: I am I, when I code which I don't do a whole lot I would probably see but I code so infrequently it's mostly just using the modeling language.

397
00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:27.960
Faculty Office Hours: You don't have to kind of go back to.

398
00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:47.250
Faculty Office Hours: The basics and and figure it out, but I mean I do things that that are similar to coding like I use, you know late tech type setting language, and I can you know design web pages, but it's it's not it's kind of at a little bit higher level than the actual programming language.

399
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:51.450
Travis Smith: And you correct me if i'm wrong you do work for SAS correct.

400
00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:54.330
Faculty Office Hours: i'm a contractor for SAS education.

401
00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:54.930
Faculty Office Hours: Okay.

402
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.040
Faculty Office Hours: With rains that.

403
00:44:57.390 --> 00:44:59.430
Faculty Office Hours: I don't get a business card.

404
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:05.490
Travis Smith: So what is, what is your opinion on jump.

405
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:13.110
Faculty Office Hours: On jump I don't know anything about it and I kind of I know what enterprise guide is but i've.

406
00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:30.150
Faculty Office Hours: used it so little boy I it's kind of scares me to talk about it because I don't really I kind of know what it's designed to do, but I don't really know how to use it very, very well, I only learned enough SAS to do exactly what we're doing in this class.

407
00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.020
gotcha.

408
00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:47.250
Faculty Office Hours: Because that that's my that's my background is in I was a professor in optimization, so I would like you know devise these models, but didn't really have a good way to implement them.

409
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:47.910
Travis Smith: mm hmm.

410
00:45:48.360 --> 00:46:00.390
Faculty Office Hours: Because when I was starting out working they really weren't modeling languages like this, you were basically you know writing a fortran program to construct a huge matrix to.

411
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:16.140
Faculty Office Hours: You know, go into some language and solve the problem and making even minor modifications to your model were just like it was it was awful because he had to like try and figure out how to change your program and hope they will compile and didn't work and you had no idea why.

412
00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:22.050
Travis Smith: The air features So yes, yeah what so so.

413
00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:25.410
Faculty Office Hours: Luckily, they had graduate students to do a lot of that work but.

414
00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:38.730
Travis Smith: I see well yeah I think that really kind of solved kind of the the problem that I was having with it and thinking about it from that standpoint, so thank you.

415
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:42.120
Faculty Office Hours: that's That was really good and I understand that, like.

416
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:52.380
Faculty Office Hours: Not everyone is comfortable coding and that's that that's in part, why the project, the final project well project two is a group project.

417
00:46:53.010 --> 00:47:09.180
Faculty Office Hours: Because you know part of it is going to entail coding, but then part of it is going to you know require people to think about you know, are the assumptions reasonable and things like that So hopefully it will you know, use the strengths of everyone in the group.

418
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:15.990
Travis Smith: that's great well, thank you, and hopefully your team wins tonight i'm hoping they do.

419
00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:20.040
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, what should be good anyway.

420
00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:23.040
Travis Smith: yeah all right well have a good night, thank you.

421
00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:24.930
Faculty Office Hours: See you later on right.

422
00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:00.780
Coleman, Clay: evening.

423
00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:02.340
Faculty Office Hours: hey.

424
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:03.570
Coleman, Clay: How are you.

425
00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:05.580
Faculty Office Hours: i'm doing well, how are you doing.

426
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:08.910
Coleman, Clay: Good good it's a little dark in here me.

427
00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:10.560
turn on.

428
00:49:12.870 --> 00:49:15.330
Faculty Office Hours: Or you can just choose a lighter background right.

429
00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:18.330
Coleman, Clay: yeah let me yeah that's totally.

430
00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:24.180
Faculty Office Hours: Do you have questions about the homework.

431
00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:28.650
Coleman, Clay: Yes, I do I do, yes, I do.

432
00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:31.020
Coleman, Clay: Okay um.

433
00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:34.860
Coleman, Clay: that's on it.

434
00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:45.690
Coleman, Clay: I, so I emailed you about question three and your help didn't help figure I figure those out so that was the one about.

435
00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:56.880
Coleman, Clay: The prediction the problem that I was running into as I was doing the overtime and I was you're using the wrong value and it didn't make sense.

436
00:49:57.930 --> 00:50:02.130
Coleman, Clay: So I removed the overtime and then it started to make sense and everything else, like that.

437
00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.570
Faculty Office Hours: So, so you kind of.

438
00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:06.510
Faculty Office Hours: look like left to change in there or.

439
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:11.100
Coleman, Clay: yeah I left the change from the overtime portion and then, when I was trying to do the further for.

440
00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.760
Coleman, Clay: problem I gotcha yeah it kind of threw a whole bunch of stuff.

441
00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:17.880
Coleman, Clay: into not where it needed to be is it.

442
00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:19.110
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, I gotcha.

443
00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:25.560
Coleman, Clay: number five I was trying to do.

444
00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:27.330
See.

445
00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:30.120
Faculty Office Hours: us share your screen.

446
00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:31.740
Coleman, Clay: Yes, Sir, are you pull.

447
00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:33.450
Coleman, Clay: up.

448
00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:40.860
Coleman, Clay: So if I look up here at you, I have another monitor over here so.

449
00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:43.770
Faculty Office Hours: That makes me feel great.

450
00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:49.200
Coleman, Clay: So.

451
00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:54.930
Coleman, Clay: How are you doing this evening.

452
00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.300
Faculty Office Hours: i'm doing fine good.

453
00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:58.440
Coleman, Clay: it's been a long day.

454
00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:02.520
No.

455
00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:12.960
Coleman, Clay: All right, so I wouldn't actually pull I got really confused, so I went and pulled the original one and tried to go back to where things were before too long.

456
00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:24.930
Coleman, Clay: So there was a question where it said we needed to set the demand conch demand COM constraints to zero.

457
00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:26.850
Faculty Office Hours: rather simple limits.

458
00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:28.380
Coleman, Clay: Okay, the limits.

459
00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:32.430
Coleman, Clay: Okay, and that's what I was trying like I.

460
00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:44.250
Coleman, Clay: tried sending it to zero, I did this, but I don't I know that that's not what you were specifically looking for, because all that does is it allows you to run it and gives you.

461
00:51:47.850 --> 00:51:55.410
Coleman, Clay: It gives you the dual values but they're in the 3000 somewhat range over here and that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me.

462
00:51:55.710 --> 00:52:05.220
Faculty Office Hours: Well, so see what you're trying to do is verify that the values in that table are the same ones that are printed out in the homework assignment right.

463
00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:06.990
Coleman, Clay: mm hmm.

464
00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:10.380
Coleman, Clay: Oh, oh hey look at that.

465
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:12.540
Coleman, Clay: I should really level.

466
00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:19.740
Faculty Office Hours: they're on the order of 3000 it may seem like a lot of money, but the batch of beer is is a lot of beer.

467
00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:24.330
Coleman, Clay: So, so if I was just setting this to zero exactly like this.

468
00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:28.590
Coleman, Clay: Oh no that's not working, which one.

469
00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:31.110
Coleman, Clay: But it's not like.

470
00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:39.810
Coleman, Clay: Oh yeah that's me trying the for loop I haven't I haven't quite gotten that one figured out yet either, but i'm getting there.

471
00:52:40.110 --> 00:52:40.380
OK.

472
00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:44.010
Coleman, Clay: OK so.

473
00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:55.800
Faculty Office Hours: Now I will tell you did something a little bit different this time than you did before, in that, before you had less than or equal to zero, and now you have equal to zero.

474
00:52:56.100 --> 00:53:04.290
Faculty Office Hours: Correct it prints the same thing, but I think it might be easier to interpret if you put less than or equal to zero.

475
00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:08.550
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so but are those values the same.

476
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.830
Coleman, Clay: They look yeah they yeah they do.

477
00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:19.170
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so that then that then that's that's half the battle right there and then the other part, is why.

478
00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.000
Coleman, Clay: Right.

479
00:53:22.110 --> 00:53:22.650
Coleman, Clay: Okay.

480
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.850
Faculty Office Hours: So.

481
00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:37.980
Coleman, Clay: let's all about, I mean the reason okay so here's my thing I was seeing these numbers and I was trying to figure out where I would even compare him to I didn't even think to go to the front page that makes a lot more sense now I should have read all the instructions.

482
00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:39.000
Coleman, Clay: Okay um.

483
00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:54.570
Coleman, Clay: So I mean the reason why is you're not producing any at all, and this is this is what's left over, you know exactly what you can produce out of each of them with the individual things that you're not so you're not producing any so you know exactly.

484
00:53:55.590 --> 00:54:01.950
Coleman, Clay: If if all of them are allowed to take as many resources as possible, that would be your dual value right.

485
00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:07.980
Faculty Office Hours: Well let's let's um so so let's let's let's go back and look at the constraints.

486
00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:18.750
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, in the model, so what the dual value tells you is how the objective value would change if you change the limit by one.

487
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:21.300
Coleman, Clay: Okay.

488
00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:25.800
Faculty Office Hours: So let's let's pick your favorite product dark ale.

489
00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:26.610
Coleman, Clay: yeah let's.

490
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:30.030
Faculty Office Hours: let's say we increase the limit for dark El to one.

491
00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:34.380
Faculty Office Hours: And then, and then we solved it what what would this solution look like.

492
00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:37.200
Faculty Office Hours: How a change.

493
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.380
Coleman, Clay: If you if you.

494
00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:44.610
Coleman, Clay: Say you're saying you have to produce it least one dark ale.

495
00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:49.770
Faculty Office Hours: Well, if if if all the limits are zero that means you produce nothing right.

496
00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:58.980
Faculty Office Hours: right if one of them changes to one then since it's less than or equal to, then you can produce one.

497
00:54:59.970 --> 00:55:00.450
Okay.

498
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:07.800
Faculty Office Hours: But of course if you're trying to maximize your net profit there's no reason why you wouldn't.

499
00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:15.870
Faculty Office Hours: right because because all of all of them are going to generate profit, if you make them.

500
00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:17.670
Coleman, Clay: Of course yeah.

501
00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:20.670
Faculty Office Hours: I mean you're not going to run out of any resources because.

502
00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:30.420
Faculty Office Hours: I mean you've seen this solution before we made the changes, you can you can produce a lot of batches of various them so.

503
00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:44.250
Faculty Office Hours: How much would How would how How would you what would you expect to happen to the net profit, if you produce one unit of dark ale one batch.

504
00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:50.130
Coleman, Clay: It would be, it would be one specific number.

505
00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:55.890
Coleman, Clay: Like it would be you would use everything you could to make that one.

506
00:55:58.110 --> 00:55:59.430
Faculty Office Hours: Well there's a recipe for it.

507
00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:08.850
Coleman, Clay: Right so yeah yeah so it would be, it would be the amount, so the number of products time that cost like how many you could make times the cost of that item.

508
00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:12.930
Faculty Office Hours: Whether it would be the it would be the revenue.

509
00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:16.170
Faculty Office Hours: minus all the costs from the recipe.

510
00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:20.820
Faculty Office Hours: And minus that fixed cost of 7500 but what would that be calculating.

511
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:28.590
Coleman, Clay: I guess.

512
00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:31.260
Faculty Office Hours: Let me try.

513
00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.310
Faculty Office Hours: to another way.

514
00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:35.460
Faculty Office Hours: OK OK, so in the in the furniture making problem.

515
00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:49.140
Faculty Office Hours: If you think of like desks there's a selling price for desks and there's how much of each resource has to go into making a desk and there is the cost of each resource.

516
00:56:51.690 --> 00:56:57.390
Faculty Office Hours: But the objective function coefficient for desks is the net profit of desks.

517
00:56:58.560 --> 00:56:59.010
Coleman, Clay: Okay.

518
00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:06.270
Faculty Office Hours: And it's like I don't know like 12 or 13, so I think it's 13 So if you made one desk.

519
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:15.600
Faculty Office Hours: What would your net profit be well, it would be that it would be the net profit of desks right the per unit net profit of desks.

520
00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:19.500
Coleman, Clay: Right.

521
00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:26.490
Faculty Office Hours: So if you if you produced one batch of dark ale what would your net profit be.

522
00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:29.370
Coleman, Clay: The.

523
00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:41.760
Coleman, Clay: The amount times the or the the cost of the items summed up, I mean it would be your your the value of your net profit.

524
00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:47.280
Faculty Office Hours: Yes, and, and so it would be that it would be the the numbers that you're trying to generate right.

525
00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:48.240
Coleman, Clay: Right correct.

526
00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:50.730
Faculty Office Hours: So so i'm just trying to help you.

527
00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:55.260
Faculty Office Hours: yeah explain why that's what the dual value is.

528
00:57:55.890 --> 00:57:56.250
OK.

529
00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:13.740
Coleman, Clay: OK, I think I understand it, a little more I think i'm gonna have to re listen to the lecture a little bit more as well and go back to that the values were a little a little not over my head, but it's gonna take some time to.

530
00:58:14.010 --> 00:58:16.320
Coleman, Clay: yeah if you go back my Ryan about that concept.

531
00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:21.630
Faculty Office Hours: If you go back a couple of slides to where that boxes, the very first box that we had.

532
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:26.550
Faculty Office Hours: it's like almost like a way, maybe one more yeah that one.

533
00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:36.090
Faculty Office Hours: That that's the definition that and then you're basically applying that definition to this particular situation.

534
00:58:37.410 --> 00:58:44.040
Faculty Office Hours: that's that that's that's that's all it's asking for in terms of an explanation okay.

535
00:58:45.630 --> 00:58:45.960
Coleman, Clay: Okay.

536
00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:53.220
Faculty Office Hours: It looks like you're on the right track with euro the loop there.

537
00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:54.960
Coleman, Clay: yeah my for loop.

538
00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:55.920
yeah.

539
00:58:57.690 --> 00:59:00.570
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so So what do you see when you do that.

540
00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:01.950
Coleman, Clay: I think.

541
00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:02.790
Faculty Office Hours: A list.

542
00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:10.020
Coleman, Clay: of names, I think I get an error, at this point because it doesn't it can't read, I mean.

543
00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:15.030
Faculty Office Hours: Okay well let's just go ahead and try it and see what happens.

544
00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:15.660
Okay.

545
00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:23.190
Coleman, Clay: I think yeah yeah the log says, I doesn't the symbol is unknown.

546
00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:25.290
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so.

547
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.590
Faculty Office Hours: let's see.

548
00:59:36.810 --> 00:59:41.490
Faculty Office Hours: let's try try the following put it in parentheses and see what happens.

549
00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:45.690
Faculty Office Hours: Though I think I see what what the problem is so here.

550
00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:47.070
Coleman, Clay: yeah i've got too many yeah.

551
00:59:47.130 --> 00:59:48.240
Coleman, Clay: i've got too many semicolon.

552
00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:49.410
Faculty Office Hours: yeah that's right now.

553
00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:52.890
Coleman, Clay: Okay.

554
00:59:52.920 --> 01:00:00.240
Faculty Office Hours: So there you go so that that's that's working for you so so what it did in the beginning, was it looped over an l statement.

555
01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:01.200
Coleman, Clay: mm hmm.

556
01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.280
Faculty Office Hours: And then.

557
01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:06.150
Coleman, Clay: It tried to print it because it didn't and I had nothing name to it.

558
01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:15.090
Faculty Office Hours: yeah yeah that's that's pretty much what it is, you know, the only time you for for statement, the only time you're going to have a semi colon is there, if you have a do block.

559
01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:16.050
Coleman, Clay: Right.

560
01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.600
Faculty Office Hours: Which is like a do semi colon and then it goes to.

561
01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:19.590
Faculty Office Hours: Something else.

562
01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:20.700
Coleman, Clay: But in that kind of like.

563
01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:22.710
Coleman, Clay: Is that kind of like a do while and.

564
01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:36.330
Faculty Office Hours: yeah there's it's it's see like do while and do until are all looping over kind of like a condition and usually it's.

565
01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.470
Faculty Office Hours: Like it like you're promoting something by one.

566
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:46.980
Faculty Office Hours: But, but the forest statement lets you loop over kind of a richer index set.

567
01:00:49.170 --> 01:00:51.300
Faculty Office Hours: In this case, it's a set of strings.

568
01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:59.760
Coleman, Clay: Right and we just want to increase the I so we also need to tie that back to the cost table, though.

569
01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:06.120
Faculty Office Hours: Well, you need to you know you're going to have an assignment statement that changes the costs in there.

570
01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:10.530
Coleman, Clay: Correct in this one right so it's going to be like a.

571
01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:15.720
Coleman, Clay: Cost of resources.

572
01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:27.930
Faculty Office Hours: So now, when you have a parameter Ray it's just a square bracket Nick because now you now you actually in whenever statement you have you're going to refer to I.

573
01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:32.820
Faculty Office Hours: Because I is going to loop over the grains and hops so.

574
01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:35.130
Coleman, Clay: So I, so the cost of Ai.

575
01:01:35.790 --> 01:01:36.960
Faculty Office Hours: And what do you want to do to it.

576
01:01:37.770 --> 01:01:42.060
Coleman, Clay: I want to multiply I want to set that equal to I times point.

577
01:01:43.770 --> 01:01:48.990
Coleman, Clay: Well, I times so cost of high.

578
01:01:55.350 --> 01:01:58.680
Coleman, Clay: You want to increase it by 10% so.

579
01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:03.510
Coleman, Clay: You could do.

580
01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.960
Coleman, Clay: Papa Papa Papa times point.

581
01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:14.730
Coleman, Clay: Zero and then add it to.

582
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:22.620
Faculty Office Hours: yeah it can be any expression that that's fine.

583
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:32.130
Faculty Office Hours: So, but you see that as you go through the loop you're.

584
01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:42.270
Faculty Office Hours: In instead of resources or whatever or hops and grains you're using the index now.

585
01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:49.020
Faculty Office Hours: And that index is, in turn, going to take the values of all the things that you want to change.

586
01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:55.350
Coleman, Clay: So can I i'm printed the cost table again, so I should be able to see.

587
01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:00.180
Coleman, Clay: here.

588
01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:02.700
Coleman, Clay: um.

589
01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:04.440
Faculty Office Hours: So where did you printed.

590
01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:05.010
It.

591
01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:10.740
Coleman, Clay: Here, and I should I could print it again before here right.

592
01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.200
Coleman, Clay: yeah and then compare the two.

593
01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:14.520
yeah.

594
01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:28.230
Coleman, Clay: So.

595
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:13.980
Coleman, Clay: So my cost table 385 mouse it's the exact same for 40462.

596
01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:17.280
Coleman, Clay: Unless.

597
01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:22.950
Faculty Office Hours: See printed the cost and then the force statement and then you pretty cost again.

598
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:26.040
Coleman, Clay: So if I print costs here again.

599
01:04:26.610 --> 01:04:28.890
Faculty Office Hours: Well, it shouldn't it should be pretty.

600
01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:31.320
Coleman, Clay: yeah that way they're just a little closer to each other.

601
01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:33.330
Coleman, Clay: And then i'll have to scroll a whole bunch.

602
01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:34.260
sure.

603
01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:37.440
Coleman, Clay: So oh yeah okay.

604
01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:41.730
Coleman, Clay: I take a picture of the wrong 135 and three five.

605
01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:44.790
Faculty Office Hours: And then maybe you should check, one of the ones it's not supposed to.

606
01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:47.250
Coleman, Clay: Bring Labor should not change at all.

607
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.580
Coleman, Clay: And then neither should this 13737.

608
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:53.220
Faculty Office Hours: seems to work in okay.

609
01:04:57.630 --> 01:04:57.990
Coleman, Clay: yeah.

610
01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:04.560
Coleman, Clay: I was it everything else, I was able to figure out, I think.

611
01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:09.120
Coleman, Clay: That wasn't near as near as hard as I thought it was going to be on this one.

612
01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:11.580
Coleman, Clay: i'm going to get rid of all these.

613
01:05:11.610 --> 01:05:15.300
Faculty Office Hours: yeah it is it's really just a matter of getting the syntax.

614
01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:21.990
Coleman, Clay: yeah and i've done a lot of programming before this one just is a spit out there.

615
01:05:24.450 --> 01:05:30.750
Faculty Office Hours: What when it will really sink in is, if you try and solve a problem that you're actually interested in.

616
01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:31.710
Coleman, Clay: Oh yeah.

617
01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:33.480
Faculty Office Hours: As opposed to making furniture.

618
01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:43.380
Faculty Office Hours: yeah because you kind of know the setting and it's just the syntax that's the extra instead of trying to learn the setting and remember everything and then.

619
01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:51.990
Coleman, Clay: ya know I remember when I first tried to sit down and learn Python like the hardest thing to do was just to sit down and learn.

620
01:05:52.290 --> 01:06:06.120
Coleman, Clay: Just how everything worked, but when I actually started having to go like actually build tools and things like that it just made so much more sense and to have that project to work on was super important but.

621
01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:15.030
Coleman, Clay: yeah I mean everything else was, I mean I had some issues like I said because I did I left, I tried to do a.

622
01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:19.920
Coleman, Clay: I tried to leave where was it.

623
01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:24.720
Faculty Office Hours: So it looks like he might actually be getting a little bit ahead of yourself in the sense that.

624
01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:31.530
Faculty Office Hours: you're actually changing the model to to see how much overtime, you would use.

625
01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:36.240
Faculty Office Hours: Which is actually a question i'm going to ask in the next assignment.

626
01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:39.300
Coleman, Clay: I thought that was on I thought that was question number one.

627
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:41.580
Faculty Office Hours: See.

628
01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:44.730
Coleman, Clay: No that's not question number one question number two.

629
01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:53.010
Coleman, Clay: If additional overtime of ring was available per hour, what would using additional overtime.

630
01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:55.980
Faculty Office Hours: So in this case, you can.

631
01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:58.950
Faculty Office Hours: drop the question just using the dual values.

632
01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:00.720
Coleman, Clay: Okay yeah.

633
01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:04.830
Faculty Office Hours: So then, but but a follow up question is okay, well then, how much.

634
01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:08.220
Coleman, Clay: Oh yeah I did I did how much.

635
01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:12.840
Faculty Office Hours: yeah and how much question you might want to just hold on to because that's going to be in a subsequent.

636
01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:14.430
Faculty Office Hours: homework assignment.

637
01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:25.560
Coleman, Clay: So I did yes and 5000 I was just so I looked at I don't remember which one it was, but there was another one that I pulled this.

638
01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:29.160
Faculty Office Hours: You probably looked at it, I think you got it at the.

639
01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:35.550
Faculty Office Hours: At the end of the slides from this week that we didn't get to in class.

640
01:07:35.970 --> 01:07:43.440
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, and so I kind of I was hopeful that we would have time but I didn't I didn't turn out that way.

641
01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:53.640
Faculty Office Hours: mm hmm so I didn't have that in the exercises that was going to be in the next one, so yeah so that that's fine but try try and see try and.

642
01:07:55.290 --> 01:07:59.670
Faculty Office Hours: Try and see if you can you can argue just on the basis of the dual values.

643
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:01.290
Coleman, Clay: Okay.

644
01:08:01.530 --> 01:08:02.640
Faculty Office Hours: In the same way that.

645
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:06.810
Faculty Office Hours: When I looked at the furniture making problem that I said okay.

646
01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:09.960
Faculty Office Hours: If I have to do, time and a half.

647
01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:16.530
Faculty Office Hours: Would I do it or not, and the answer, there was no because the dual value was kind of dinky.

648
01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:19.470
Coleman, Clay: This one is 36.

649
01:08:20.010 --> 01:08:23.010
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so it's question you know what, what do you want to compare that to.

650
01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:28.200
Faculty Office Hours: What if you go back and look at the example earlier in the lecture that should.

651
01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:33.240
Coleman, Clay: Right and that that was the yeah that's don't say.

652
01:08:38.730 --> 01:08:39.150
Coleman, Clay: Oh.

653
01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:45.840
Faculty Office Hours: I think you got a little, but.

654
01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.120
Faculty Office Hours: One one more maybe there you go.

655
01:08:51.150 --> 01:08:51.810
Coleman, Clay: Yes, one.

656
01:08:52.350 --> 01:08:55.110
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so it's basically the exact same question.

657
01:08:55.620 --> 01:09:03.480
Faculty Office Hours: it's just that it's it's in a different model and the numbers are different but it's basically the same you know time and a half.

658
01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:09.840
Faculty Office Hours: So it's a they get paid a little bit better in the in the brewing problem.

659
01:09:10.350 --> 01:09:10.740
yeah.

660
01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:24.120
Coleman, Clay: yeah so basically you're you're subtracting, so this is your 36 but the other one is 18 so it's the difference between the two.

661
01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:31.080
Faculty Office Hours: uh well let's see so so so the the.

662
01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:35.400
Coleman, Clay: This would be your one, so your difference between the two is what a.

663
01:09:37.830 --> 01:09:39.090
Coleman, Clay: Here you're looking at nine.

664
01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.510
Coleman, Clay: So you're nine would be this value.

665
01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:50.700
Coleman, Clay: And you're you're 36 would be this value so 36 minus nine would still be positive.

666
01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:53.280
Faculty Office Hours: Look look a little bit better than negative six.

667
01:09:54.450 --> 01:09:54.810
Coleman, Clay: yeah.

668
01:09:55.950 --> 01:10:03.330
Coleman, Clay: A little bit okay well i'll update my question I I was just assuming to go and do it in the program but.

669
01:10:03.690 --> 01:10:06.690
Faculty Office Hours: yeah like well like I said to you just hold on to that one because it'll.

670
01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:10.140
Faculty Office Hours: it'll save you having to do it again the next week.

671
01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:18.510
Coleman, Clay: yeah very cool well, I appreciate your help, I sorry I mean where was I, the only one that did you have more people, I hope, or.

672
01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.010
Faculty Office Hours: Have you just oh yeah yeah.

673
01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:27.780
Coleman, Clay: Okay, good good good, well, I won't keep you past your I guess eight o'clock is your cut off time sorry i'm so late.

674
01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.230
Coleman, Clay: But I truly appreciate it.

675
01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:33.030
Faculty Office Hours: i'll just take a pound of flesh.

676
01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:38.040
Coleman, Clay: it's definitely it's definitely been interesting I would I wish.

677
01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:43.440
Coleman, Clay: This was sooner in the program but you know.

678
01:10:43.770 --> 01:10:45.150
Faculty Office Hours: we'll just tell her that.

679
01:10:45.570 --> 01:10:47.160
Coleman, Clay: OK, I will make sure to tell you that.

680
01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:50.370
Coleman, Clay: it's it's it's kind of hard here at the end.

681
01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:55.890
Coleman, Clay: You know, with caps out like I saw I haven't presented my capstone.

682
01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:06.870
Faculty Office Hours: So before before last year we'd always taught it in the fall and so that was it was a little easier, because then you know the you're less busy.

683
01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:16.800
Faculty Office Hours: there's less interruptions The only difficulty with that is that people who work in retail and just get killed from thanksgiving to Christmas so yeah.

684
01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:18.990
Coleman, Clay: yeah like luckily.

685
01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:31.440
Coleman, Clay: i'm taking the pressure the programming class and i'm i'm much more i'm glad i'm not taking the financial analysis class I look at their their chat every once in a while that we have like a group chat and man.

686
01:11:32.010 --> 01:11:37.140
Coleman, Clay: They don't sound too happy with that class, so I said sounded like it's rough but.

687
01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:39.480
But yeah.

688
01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:48.000
Coleman, Clay: But if we'd had this a little sure I feel like I would I would maybe learn more and be more incentivized to.

689
01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:50.430
Faculty Office Hours: be able to utilize it more.

690
01:11:50.850 --> 01:11:52.260
Coleman, Clay: That to that too.

691
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:55.800
Coleman, Clay: But also, maybe internalize more of it right now.

692
01:11:57.030 --> 01:12:00.240
Coleman, Clay: Not, not to say that I have seen here is, but I mean we're.

693
01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.030
Faculty Office Hours: All getting pulled in too many directions.

694
01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:06.840
Coleman, Clay: yeah yeah I mean we're a whole 29 days from ending this program so.

695
01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:10.620
Coleman, Clay: mm hmm but it's been definitely been a good one.

696
01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:11.820
Okay.

697
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.410

Coleman, Clay: i'm a.

709
01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:47.880
Coleman, Clay: We call this part of the distance learning group, so I never go to campus.

710
01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:51.300
Coleman, Clay: I always sit here in the same room and.

711
01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.380
