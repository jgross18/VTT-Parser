00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.049
MS Analytics Class 2021: hey Hello.

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.389
MS Analytics Class 2021: hi everyone usually my research to introduce standard issue, and I was just sitting there at six o'clock so I apologize.

3
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:23.070
MS Analytics Class 2021: No worries but well thanks for being here, I think they all know what you're here for, so I will let you get started, and I think we go to seven and then.

4
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:32.520
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then we have the last class for me for the for the first half of semester, and then next Thursday i'll have Dr hartman and start optimization.

5
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:44.250
MS Analytics Class 2021: So thanks for being here and there's my right there yeah we're good i'll go the instructors myers usually here to introduce you so are they all over yes.

6
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: i'm gonna try this Mike awesome.

7
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.860
Usera, Daniel: All right, thank you, thank you alright, how we do in class 2021.

8
00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.100
Zuberi, Bilal: Well, thank you.

9
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.390
Usera, Daniel: I see it, see some head dogs and I see some shaky hands so was, I mean.

10
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.550
Jim Clark: we're going through the process.

11
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:22.680
Usera, Daniel: going through the process so tell me where you are in this process and, yes, surviving i'm very proud of you all surviving the 63 days till you graduate moment it's our you're saying like.

12
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.640
Usera, Daniel: We got 63 days left is that number done.

13
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.370
Usera, Daniel: alright.

14
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:40.590
Jim Clark: So Duffy sure if I could ask a quick question are you going to or were you planning on giving any direct feedback on the visual content that we submitted a week ago.

15
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.400
Usera, Daniel: Yes, I it's actually on my agenda starting tomorrow.

16
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.150
Jim Clark: Okay.

17
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.950
Usera, Daniel: Great that's start looking through.

18
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:58.260
Usera, Daniel: it's going to take a while, because you are longer debts like 42nd me a lot of you have 3040 slides for presentation, so what i'm probably going to do is give just overall feedback and point to a few things.

19
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:06.180
Usera, Daniel: So what typically happens with people who haven't done a lot of work with PowerPoint or coaching my PowerPoint.

20
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.830
Usera, Daniel: there's like common mistakes that will weave throughout every like several slides, so what i'm going to probably do to be efficient.

21
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.010
Usera, Daniel: Is all pointed out, at least on one slide and then you'll have to generalize you have to learn from that one slide and then do it because.

22
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:30.870
Usera, Daniel: it's going to take a lot of time to just try to point out every single little thing does that make sense, so i'll try to point out like on this slide you do this so for other slides make sure you don't do that either.

23
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.980
Usera, Daniel: So sometimes when students when they see grading and markings.

24
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.250
Usera, Daniel: They assume that if I didn't mark on it that it was Okay, but like if if there was already an error on a previous slide, this is a very.

25
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.750
Usera, Daniel: Similar slide that assume that you probably need to make that change on others as well, so what will probably be is mostly comments.

26
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:58.080
Usera, Daniel: That you'll see in the comments box, with some markings on some slides that's probably what we're going to do it to make it efficient, otherwise I could spend a month.

27
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:06.420
Usera, Daniel: Like going through each slide and drawing things and pointing things so I want to make sure you get feedback in a timely manner that makes sense.

28
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:17.310
Jim Clark: Yes, it does so that's the second questions we were on the 11th we're scheduled to turn in our presentation and so that the obvious question is, do we.

29
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:27.900
Jim Clark: Do we do it do it in appropriate dress this way sitting down or do we need to try to simulate a standard presentation, where the three.

30
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:41.910
Jim Clark: i'm just i'm just asking because someone's thinking that and I would I would prefer to do it like like we're talking here and making the presentation, but that may not be what the rules are so I want just wanted to clarify that are.

31
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:51.120
Usera, Daniel: Are there rules on so are their expectations outlines and is there, like a thesis like handbook or like thesis assignment sheet or anything that.

32
00:03:51.870 --> 00:04:03.210
Usera, Daniel: would have a resource I don't think so there's nothing that says anything about style of virtual presentation, this is my first go round with that, so I don't I so i'm not sure.

33
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.930
If there will.

34
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.210
Usera, Daniel: be a precedent for virtual.

35
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.680
Usera, Daniel: Presenting I don't think either so.

36
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.180
Jim Clark: So and that's Okay, it can be something that's after class but.

37
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.560
Jim Clark: That is something.

38
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.220
That.

39
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.530
Jim Clark: You know this is our first experience doing this under covert conditions, too, so.

40
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.950
Jim Clark: yeah we rush things are different so i'll do the best I can.

41
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.820
Usera, Daniel: sure if it was up to me, I think i'll leave it up to the presenter.

42
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:40.710
Usera, Daniel: So those of you who really want to do something standing and give that really formal look I think it'll look good if you have a good lighting distance angle and we talked about virtual presenting already right we already talked about how to look good on camera and all those things.

43
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.170
Usera, Daniel: So.

44
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.460
Jim Clark: Yes, Sir, we have.

45
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:51.270
Usera, Daniel: If you've already done that, if you if you can, if you can manage the camera well and all that standing up, then I think that's a good way to go.

46
00:04:51.750 --> 00:05:02.610
Usera, Daniel: If you do sitting down that, of course, make sure same thing lighting distance angle, and I would ask that everyone dress appropriately to wear a presentation like this, so business formal.

47
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:11.430
Usera, Daniel: Know T shirts no hoodies none of that this is a formal presentation for a master that science degree, so we got to make sure we look the part.

48
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:27.960
Usera, Daniel: Because i'm starting to notice people get too comfortable at home and it's it kind of takes away from the real gravity of what you're doing here, which is presenting findings to a potential decision maker, or to a group so we want to, we want to respect the occasion for sure.

49
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:35.970
Usera, Daniel: So let's call it a dress rehearsal for March 11 so I want to make sure everyone's dressed up and they really take this seriously and.

50
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:43.020
Usera, Daniel: Really, place the gravity or simulate simulator anyway, I guess you would simulate the gravity of the situation.

51
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.050
Jim Clark: Okay, thank you very much yeah.

52
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:55.380
Usera, Daniel: Okay there any other general administrative questions so yeah i'm hoping, I can get a lot of them done over the next three days.

53
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:07.020
Usera, Daniel: As far as feedback for you all, and then i'll give you at least a few days to make changes like I said it's gonna be more broad based feedback but it'll least be enough to give you some direction and pointers and such.

54
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.640
Usera, Daniel: And done.

55
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.440
Usera, Daniel: For the 11th yeah i'll feedback for you and on.

56
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:26.970
Usera, Daniel: On so somebody asked what's the directive, do we for reporting yeah like it's my understanding is supposed to be a real thing like it's it's a practice it's a rehearsal.

57
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:38.790
Usera, Daniel: So you run through the whole thing like as if you're giving it on game day so yeah That was my understanding of it myra myra has something different, and let me know, but that was my understanding it's the ball it's a full scale dresser result.

58
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:39.420
wow.

59
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:49.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: yeah my grandma I don't believe that this is just the last project cooked you'd be right Ben Ben the video we're talking about.

60
00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:59.850
MS Analytics Class 2021: One more one yeah this one more thing it's just normal project yeah, so I think we'll have an hour and so like we'll have each project coach about has has like 60 minutes.

61
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:15.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: To go through an hour, so I think it's like a mini cameras going to get my ring because I don't we've never had a dress rehearsal but I don't know because that's that's not I coach people to get their capstone very I don't post, the actual like that part of what they're doing.

62
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.840
or.

63
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.830
Usera, Daniel: Why not so yeah listening so like an.

64
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:28.020
MS Analytics Class 2021: 11 since our last meeting it's usually it's an hour and so that's just where we make sure all the DS and eyes are crossed and dotted and.

65
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:42.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: And everything everybody's ready to go and that way, I mean if you have anybody who's kind of risks project coaches can let you know, Dr hill know and myron hot here and say hey this person is gonna be a little more time or something like that.

66
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay don't believe that's what the left, on his left and.

67
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:50.970
MS Analytics Class 2021: that's usually what it is the last part that coach meeting is kind of what we've always done here, the last couple.

68
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.160
MS Analytics Class 2021: But we'll clarify okay yeah.

69
00:07:54.030 --> 00:08:01.740
Usera, Daniel: That makes sense, make sense, yes I have on march 11 on my calendar, I have feedback for slides and I had something about rehearsal to or some kind of practice.

70
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:02.310
MS Analytics Class 2021: So.

71
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.710
Usera, Daniel: I was expecting at least have slides for you all by.

72
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.990
Usera, Daniel: march 11 so it would make sense that probably the rehearsal if there is one it's going to be later yeah.

73
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:16.860
Usera, Daniel: Okay yeah let's have Mayra clarify that yeah okay anything else so on the administrative side we'll figure out the whole rehearsal thing.

74
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:32.400
Usera, Daniel: Did they have a rehearsal on march 11 or ideas have feedback for the slides on march 11 right or do they are they I thought we talked about them doing rehearsal too, but now i'm starting to.

75
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:37.230
Look.

76
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.880
MS Analytics Class 2021: Just your last meeting featuring you go through to do updates.

77
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.540
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then from there, they haven't told the 22nd to turn in their final capstone slide.

78
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:01.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: And secondly, any feedback, you have Dr Sarah on the non technical review anything about the database.

79
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:16.920
Usera, Daniel: Okay, but there's no rehearsal there's no rehearsal on the 11th or anything like that it's just and i'm putting into also get a little feedback to write.

80
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:25.770
Usera, Daniel: This is so I guess we'll do all star, we have to do the administrative talk now, but just to make sure that we have the right tone for today is that right i'm coming in, on the 11th to to give all feedback.

81
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:58.140
Usera, Daniel: I thought we talked about them doing something like that, too, and that's why you see what's going to happen either on or after the 11th so it's later we can figure it out, but all about for sure i'll have feedback for slides by 11 so that way, the.

82
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.700
And then, it says zoom presentation capstone.

83
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.230
As if you're presenting it to your cohort and that consumer.

84
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: slide deck is doing a Google drive by March 11.

85
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.820
Usera, Daniel: OK, so the zoom.

86
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:48.360
Usera, Daniel: Okay, so the zoom recording doesn't happen on that day, but it starts to happen after that day, because I think they do it on their own time right they they get together as a cohort and then they just do it, and then submit the recording right.

87
00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: So, ideally, they would have it done by the so that you have time to break those.

88
00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.570
Usera, Daniel: Not the rehearsal i'll talk about the rehearsals yeah.

89
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.370
MS Analytics Class 2021: You tell me how long you need to.

90
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.250
MS Analytics Class 2021: Start like.

91
00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:23.100
Usera, Daniel: yeah so i'll be back for slides probably by Monday or Tuesday of next week and then I can do rehearsals anytime after that so um yeah so if we give a like a little period to just get together as a group.

92
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.660
Usera, Daniel: And then split the recording we can do that.

93
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:37.920
Karen Fireman: Okay, so I have a question it's Karen so each person has a half hour and they're going to send you 50 people times a half hour that's 25 hours of your time, Dr you Sarah that you're going to review these because we're not groups you keep saying group.

94
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:43.620
Karen Fireman: we're not groups right so it's 2050 individual half hour recordings is that what you're looking for.

95
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.710
Usera, Daniel: years.

96
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:47.820
Usera, Daniel: Is that right that.

97
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:50.700
Usera, Daniel: half hour, because then I will probably need more time to look at him.

98
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.790
Charles Swanson: And then know where exactly do we turn these in.

99
00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:56.910
Usera, Daniel: Okay, so we'll have to figure that out.

100
00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:04.860
Usera, Daniel: Mayra like hi to rehearsal part because now that that is a lot of questions to um but yeah for sure, slides you'll get feedback by the 11th.

101
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:18.360
Coleman, Clay: Monday 10 and then also if we're not technically finished with all of our slides that we do we just present what we have at that time and then because we still have another 10 days after that to work on final things and.

102
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: we're gonna be looking for.

103
00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:30.300
Jim Clark: Probably watch your videos at double time looking at your background.

104
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.240
and your body language.

105
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:39.540
MS Analytics Class 2021: Maybe some word choice generally general overview.

106
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:42.300
MS Analytics Class 2021: models.

107
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:54.600
Karen Fireman: To kind of give you some feedback, and these are graded assignments, or just option and what.

108
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.740
Karen Fireman: group zoom or the zoom and he's reviewing.

109
00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.490
MS Analytics Class 2021: Your practice run.

110
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.640
Karen Fireman: yeah and he's doing that on double time got it.

111
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.880
Usera, Daniel: yeah I won't be able to watch the whole thing of all of them already know that.

112
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:38.880
Usera, Daniel: But all these watch parts and you know, make sure that you know, whatever I do review and looks good so it's kind of those things where you don't know which part of the watch, so you want to make sure each part is good.

113
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:46.140
Usera, Daniel: Because you don't know if someone wants to beginning or the middle or the end so you got to be on point on all on all three aspects of the game, but.

114
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:56.100
Usera, Daniel: what's important is when we say groups, I mean like you're going to get in your car and you're going to present to your group to your cohort to a group of people, so that we don't stop presenting to yourself, is the idea.

115
00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.930
Karen Fireman: And then I would want to we don't.

116
00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:00.180
Karen Fireman: We don't present to our group you keep saying that.

117
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:03.570
Usera, Daniel: that's how we're going to do the rehearsals right where they're going to.

118
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:04.020
Coleman, Clay: Do.

119
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:06.600
Karen Fireman: I think minutes, with our group.

120
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.680
MS Analytics Class 2021: So.

121
00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: yeah when you do.

122
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:25.050
MS Analytics Class 2021: Your final capstone project you're imagining your audience as a couple that's the piece.

123
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:27.570
shadi kilani: um.

124
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:40.140
shadi kilani: Excuse me, could you please then send us sort of clear instructions or what needs to be delivered when and maybe where we should turn that in so we can make sure we do it on a timely way.

125
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:41.100
shadi kilani: yeah waiter.

126
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:49.080
shadi kilani: And you guys want it, so if you if you don't mind if you could send us a set of clear instructions we'd love to you know do that Thank you so much.

127
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:56.790
Usera, Daniel: yeah absolutely, so I think yeah let me, am I read sort all that out, and then we'll have something in writing, I always like things in writing.

128
00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:03.660
Usera, Daniel: So we'll have it that way, and then you'll have deadlines and all that stuff and then probably submission if you're just by yourself.

129
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:13.440
Usera, Daniel: Like what you're imagining your audience, I thought you're going to do it in your groups and you're going to send the recording that way that way you have people to react to if you do it by yourself and you just do on pajamas.

130
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:15.510
Usera, Daniel: So, then you just do it there.

131
00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:25.920
Usera, Daniel: So either way either way we'll figure it out well for out the logistics, but just know on the horizon, you have your slides and then you have a rehearsal and we want to be a dress rehearsal so make sure you're dressed up.

132
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:33.270
shadi kilani: So we'll do anything you ask us to do you want us to do a combination of just let us know what you want us to do that, it was about to do it.

133
00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:38.820
Usera, Daniel: Thank you, well, I appreciate that I appreciate that um but yeah We definitely want to be.

134
00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:47.010
Usera, Daniel: Complete so we definitely want you to have a full run through we want you to have a good practice So yes, complete presentation start to finish.

135
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:58.110
Usera, Daniel: So you don't want to have something that you didn't practice and then you do you show up on game day and then that part didn't go as expected just practice it so to make it complete make it useful and go from there.

136
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.440
Usera, Daniel: Okay anything else.

137
00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:10.680
Karen Fireman: um yeah if you have some ideas for us on little pointers we should you know watch for for that presentation that would be useful.

138
00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.300
Usera, Daniel: Oh yeah oh yeah.

139
00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.760
Usera, Daniel: yeah go that's why they do list or something.

140
00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.410
Karen Fireman: Maybe a list Thank you so much.

141
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:24.510
Usera, Daniel: yeah that's what today is about that's what it's about so I know we had a cancellation, I hope you all did okay through the power crisis and such in the winter storm.

142
00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:35.160
Usera, Daniel: I think what we're what we're combining today is more on powerpoints and that and just more on virtual presenting, but I think we're going to put more focus on PowerPoint now.

143
00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:42.990
Usera, Daniel: Did you all watch the or received at least received the video lectures on PowerPoint that I made I think you've got him a while back it was like December.

144
00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.760
Karen Fireman: or January, yes, yes.

145
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.230
Usera, Daniel: Okay, so.

146
00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:55.500
Usera, Daniel: there's a lot of ways we can tackle a PowerPoint we can, if you have some general questions you want to ask if not we can we can look at some slides and then go that way it's up to you.

147
00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:05.880
Usera, Daniel: So do we does anybody have any questions about the lecture anything that we talked about there or general comments, and then we can go that way or I can show you some slides What would you prefer.

148
00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:17.160
Usera, Daniel: Does anyone have any questions from the lecture or any comments things insights.

149
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:31.290
Jim Clark: Sure, I think, recently, you posted up a PowerPoint presentation talking about slide formats that that was an addition to your your three lectures is that right or.

150
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:42.810
Jim Clark: Because I pulled it down today, which is wild I didn't know if you were if you That was something you do put in and I just didn't downloaded or with with supplemental is I guess is what i'm asking.

151
00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.390
Usera, Daniel: something about slide formats.

152
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:53.280
Jim Clark: Yes, Sir, it was about slide format, it was I thought it was supplemental to to your three YouTube lectures.

153
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:58.620
Jim Clark: So I I thought you were going to talk from that but that's that's fine.

154
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.440
Jim Clark: i've already monopolize too much time.

155
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.860
Usera, Daniel: Oh no you're fine you're Fine, let me clarify so yeah we have the.

156
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:18.210
Usera, Daniel: You have data visualization that should be the Green and White lecture series that you saw with all the Green and White slides and then there's PowerPoint which is like the orange and white slides so those Those are the two that you would be have one would have watched.

157
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:24.210
Usera, Daniel: So do you recall, like the orange.

158
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.660
Karen Fireman: This is there were three sets of.

159
00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:28.650
Karen Fireman: slides that we did.

160
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:30.270
Usera, Daniel: I think.

161
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:37.740
Usera, Daniel: Originally, but also white was like this, so this is the the PowerPoint series, this would have been the cover and then the theme, so if you recall, this theme.

162
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.690
Karen Fireman: This the orange one I remember yeah.

163
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:50.040
Usera, Daniel: yeah, so this is what today's about, and then we had the one on virtual presenting, which was the white I don't have it pulled up or do I pulled up i'd have to see okay yeah this one, we already saw.

164
00:18:52.380 --> 00:19:00.870
Usera, Daniel: Okay, and then this is virtual presenting, so you probably I know we talked about this in class and on data visualization was the green and white.

165
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:08.280
Usera, Daniel: So I color coded them to make it more easily to retrieve okay so.

166
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:27.630
Usera, Daniel: I don't have data is pulled up but yeah alright so here's we're going to do let's look at some slots well first let's Let me give some general comments or additional thoughts on PowerPoint and then we'll look at some slides and apply some principles that we learned from the lecture.

167
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:44.280
Usera, Daniel: So I think and there's a lot to go like i'm not going to obviously give the whole lecture again, but the one thing that I want you all to remember when it comes to powerpoints and specifically.

168
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:58.320
Usera, Daniel: What you learn from database is concept visualization so remember when we talked about data this we what we talked about visualizing concepts and type in textual ideas.

169
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:08.490
Usera, Daniel: You all remember that concept visualization and established the nodes relate the notes all those things those three steps are you all, recalling that.

170
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:23.340
Usera, Daniel: Okay, so part of what good PowerPoint is is it's better for the audience to see the point than to read the point.

171
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:30.780
Usera, Daniel: So one of my little maxims of powerpoints and I have like I have 10 different maxim's that I talked about with PowerPoint.

172
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:38.880
Usera, Daniel: Is it's better for the audience to see the point than to read the point remember the problem humans cannot read and listen, at the same time.

173
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:48.450
Usera, Daniel: The human brain is just not made that way you can't read and hit read speech and also listen to a speech at the same time you're either going to read and then.

174
00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:53.130
Usera, Daniel: kind of put speech in the background or you're going to listen to the speech and you're not going to be able to read.

175
00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:57.720
Usera, Daniel: So one of the principles of PowerPoint is you don't divide your audience's attention.

176
00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:05.490
Usera, Daniel: You what you want to do is you want to keep the audience's attention focus on one particular thing now when you're giving a presentation.

177
00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:17.970
Usera, Daniel: Obviously you're going to be talking through the presentation, so when you show visuals you want the visuals to be things that the audience can look at, but not necessarily have to read or think about they just see the point.

178
00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:22.950
Usera, Daniel: So good PowerPoint is PowerPoint that I don't have to think about the design.

179
00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:32.790
Usera, Daniel: Good PowerPoint is PowerPoint where I just see the point effortlessly and I can follow you while you talk, and so my brain isn't overwhelmed.

180
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:41.070
Usera, Daniel: The biggest problem people have, so this is called death by PowerPoint right what's death by PowerPoint, by the way, when you hear the phrase death by PowerPoint what is that.

181
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.090
Usera, Daniel: would that mean to you.

182
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:47.670
Jim Clark: it's all text.

183
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:49.350
Usera, Daniel: it's all text.

184
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:53.910
Usera, Daniel: Okay that's definitely one thing it's nothing but texts, so why is this a visual aid if it's all text.

185
00:21:54.120 --> 00:22:05.190
shadi kilani: it's overwhelming, so you can't really see the point and you're just stuck there trying to find what the person is trying to say and you're trying to emulate what they're saying what's on the points where you can't really find what they're talking about in the slides.

186
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:15.090
Usera, Daniel: Yes, Okay, so we got two things so far super tasty right i'm reading the whole time so what's the point of having a presenter if i'm just going to read the slides okay.

187
00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:28.140
Usera, Daniel: So, and yes bullets bullets bullets nothing but bullets there's no diversity it's there's no visualization going on it's just text it's textual transfer not textual digitalization okay information overload so thank you, thank you shoddy.

188
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:40.710
Usera, Daniel: Yes, information overload putting too much on the slides to where the audience can't process it information overload is a real problem, like a lot of people think oh it's going to be information overload no it's information overload.

189
00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:55.740
Usera, Daniel: I just found out that air force air force pilots like jet fighter pilots, they have a little phrase in the air force it's called our pilots having a helmet fire, so a helmet fire is where the pilots helmet hud.

190
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.410
Usera, Daniel: presents a lot of information at once.

191
00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:03.570
Usera, Daniel: And what sometimes happens is the pilot gets so overwhelmed with information they either start to freak out.

192
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:09.780
Usera, Daniel: or they become paralyzed because there's so much information being shown to them at the same time, and so on the radio they kind of like.

193
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.930
Usera, Daniel: And it's called a helmet fire like they start to go a little bit crazy so.

194
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:26.040
Usera, Daniel: On pilot helmets they have a complex mode and then a simple mode that simplifies the information, so the pilot can still act and make quick decisions without being overwhelmed by information so information overload is a real thing.

195
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:42.930
Usera, Daniel: And that's where I think a lot of powerpoints can go wrong or go badly is we put too much on the slide too much at once now we're in a technical field, and this is technical communication so we're going to have audiences who very much care about details.

196
00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:44.790
Usera, Daniel: So.

197
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.420
Usera, Daniel: here's the little say that you can always remember.

198
00:23:49.620 --> 00:24:02.190
Usera, Daniel: If you have to show everything do so, but you don't always have to show it all at once, you can show it in a sequence or you can give the audience time to look at something and then after they processed it then at a point.

199
00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:11.970
Usera, Daniel: If you have to show everything then do so, but you don't always have to do it at once, is the idea and we're going to look at some sample before and after slides so that's what I have planned today.

200
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:19.890
Usera, Daniel: And they're actually from previous capstones of Ms analytics and we'll get to kind of see three principles only teach you three techniques.

201
00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:27.930
Usera, Daniel: So I can't go over all the PowerPoint with you all, because that's there's just not enough time to do that so hopefully you'll watch the video lectures and you'll get a lot out of it.

202
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:33.390
Usera, Daniel: But well at least teach you three techniques, so when you go through your slide decks again.

203
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:43.950
Usera, Daniel: When you need to figure out how to simplify and to make things more visual and not so overwhelming and textual in death by PowerPoint on just those two definitions alone.

204
00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:56.220
Usera, Daniel: Those three techniques will help you decide what's a good way to go, okay so that's one thing you will leave with today are three little techniques to help with your slides what else is death by PowerPoint mean I also saw monotone.

205
00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:08.550
Usera, Daniel: vocal variety people vocal variety pitch pace and volume so have a good pitch very your pitch go little high go a little low.

206
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:19.860
Usera, Daniel: Just don't be one tone, the whole time because one telling the whole time gets really old, especially when your presentations or a half hour and we're going to be sitting through a half hour of people talking about data, of all things.

207
00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:26.550
Usera, Daniel: And you're not really passionate about the topic so then when you're not really passionate about the topic it's like if you're not passionate, why should I be passionate.

208
00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:40.890
Usera, Daniel: If you don't care, why should I care if you don't believe it, why should I believe it if you don't believe in the product, why should I buy the product if you don't care about if you don't if you sound like you don't care, then why do I, why should I care okay.

209
00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:56.880
Usera, Daniel: All right, so yes vocal variety people energy have some enthusiasm, this is your project, how many hours have you all spent on NSA analytic on this on this capstone like how many hours have you have you logged in put in the chat how many hours have you logged already.

210
00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:58.770
Usera, Daniel: On this capstone.

211
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.690
Wilson: You want to see that.

212
00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:04.740
Usera, Daniel: Oh, I want to see, I want to see I did a dissertation I you know y'all.

213
00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:13.020
Usera, Daniel: got like three years Okay, so one birthday three hours we had somebody I don't know how many zeros that is 60 plus.

214
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:28.170
Usera, Daniel: Okay, so we have a range of three hours to 100 to 100 to some degree of power hundred and 50 hours Okay, these are hours of your life you're never going to get back.

215
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:36.960
Usera, Daniel: i'm sure there were beautiful hours i'm sure you did a lot of great things and you did a lot of great analysis okay So these are hours that you, you gave up your life.

216
00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:46.050
Usera, Daniel: So you should be proud of what you're about to show us there should be some excitement, there should be some passion, there should be some care because you put so much time into this.

217
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.940
Usera, Daniel: You should be upset if people look bored because you put so much time into this thing okay.

218
00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:59.280
Usera, Daniel: So yes, have some passion it doesn't matter, even if it's a dispassionate topic or talking about oil it's okay what Why is oil important to me.

219
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:13.500
Usera, Daniel: As an audience, why should I care about oil and what you're going to do what's the why behind things just don't tell us what tell us why, why is this important to me so communicating with non technical people technical non technical people don't care about how they just care about why.

220
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.610
Usera, Daniel: So how you got to something they're dying, you know they're probably going to maybe understand it, maybe not.

221
00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:31.710
Usera, Daniel: But if you say I did this analysis and here's why it's important it's important because, when you log on to the Internet, if you don't have this security, then a hacker can steal your credit card.

222
00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.660
Usera, Daniel: Oh, people are gonna listen now now people care because you relate it to them.

223
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:53.970
Usera, Daniel: Okay, and yes, oil can be passionate listen if we don't pump enough oil, out of a well oil prices go up, so this new technique or this new analysis that I did can help us get more oil and be more efficient and also help the environment and save you money Okay, but now I care.

224
00:27:55.530 --> 00:28:01.020
Usera, Daniel: So that's what you gotta do when you're communicating technical stuff to non technical people, why should they care, how does it relate to them.

225
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:10.650
Usera, Daniel: Be that bridge to make that relationship and people will listen, but if you just throw math and numbers and like what welcome you don't get it it's because you didn't relate it to them right into that.

226
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:17.130
Usera, Daniel: that's right, you can pay for oil using your credit cards, I get stolen by the hacker if you don't get cyber security So there you go.

227
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.900
Usera, Daniel: And bitcoin when it's when it's up its up in price that's right candle.

228
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.690
Usera, Daniel: Okay um.

229
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.030
Usera, Daniel: Other things other things, if not let's look at some techniques.

230
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:40.080
Usera, Daniel: Now i'll have to i'm not I don't have a degree in Ms analytics so the slides that I did I don't have all the knowledge of like.

231
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:46.530
Usera, Daniel: Because these are all based off using jump So if I took some liberties, you know you can mention them but.

232
00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:53.400
Usera, Daniel: The techniques are more important to me, then, like getting the content right as far as i'm concerned i'm here just to teach you techniques.

233
00:28:53.670 --> 00:29:06.030
Usera, Daniel: And then you will get the content right you all are the content experts so you'll know what you should substitute if if I did something wrong on to the data that kind of thing Okay, so let me just do a quick screen share here.

234
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:12.000
Usera, Daniel: Okay, so I want to put this in presentation mode.

235
00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.480
Usera, Daniel: All right, can you all see the PowerPoint.

236
00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:17.790
Usera, Daniel: overhead.

237
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:18.810
Wilson: Yes, sir.

238
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:34.920
Usera, Daniel: Alright, so let me show you three things that you can do to simplify your powerpoints and these and i've looked at a few capstones from the past, so if if I could go back to previous years and then just give like one little lecture or one little lesson, this would be the lesson okay.

239
00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:36.690
Usera, Daniel: Now.

240
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.240
Usera, Daniel: So here's one from somebody.

241
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:51.750
Usera, Daniel: PowerPoint from somebody capstone so I don't think that the idea that Oh, the men that standards are low for capstone no no you're going to be higher, because now, I think, is now i'm here and Mars here and we're all we're all expecting new things and better things.

242
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:54.690
Usera, Daniel: Okay, so eating at the slide.

243
00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:05.100
Usera, Daniel: So someone gets a presentation all right here's the business impact and then here's a bunch of lines.

244
00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:18.600
Usera, Daniel: here's the business impact it allowed rsvp to own their budgets and they couldn't use though it was given to me excuse it allowed all sides to know why behind the numbers.

245
00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:29.880
Usera, Daniel: before it was a more of a negotiation, because they had to negotiate things and now it's a collaboration and allowed regional Vice Presidents to focus on their controller bowls okay so what's good what's good about this slide or not good.

246
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:38.520
Jim Clark: It makes it really hard for all the slides to come after that one for people to hang with you.

247
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:46.260
Jim Clark: yeah it well, when I look at it, it looks like the stream of consciousness.

248
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:56.250
Jim Clark: But at the same time, if you've got to say it that way that's fine, but after that it's a real it's gonna be really hard to keep everyone's attention after this slide.

249
00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.050
Jim Clark: If this first slide they see.

250
00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:08.040
Usera, Daniel: I mean it's a lot of bullet points okay it's a lot of tax and yeah and some of these bullets I don't really know why they're their own bullets.

251
00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:14.430
Usera, Daniel: Because, for example, allowed rv he's the owner budgets Okay, I guess the impact of the analysis is they're going to.

252
00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:21.030
Usera, Daniel: And I guess to own their budgets means they're going to like take responsibility, so I don't know if that's the best word to own, but like.

253
00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:29.520
Usera, Daniel: before it was more of a negotiation now with the collaboration now like, I feel like this could be one bullet point oops so I feel like this could be one bullet point you know.

254
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:40.350
Usera, Daniel: And loud all sides know the why behind the numbers, you know could, is there a way we can simplify that sentence, so we don't have that lingering word beneath so as we're going through here.

255
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:50.880
Usera, Daniel: Like is there a way to get rid of this can we simplify this can we combine these two are there ways that we can just reduce some of the text here and to make it more simple, to the point.

256
00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:59.430
Usera, Daniel: bullets and I think, so I think so, so one technique that you can easily learn, and you probably have heard this one before it's just simplification.

257
00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.150
Usera, Daniel: When you're going to show a lot of texts or you're going to show a lot of data.

258
00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:09.570
Usera, Daniel: Is there a way to put things in a more simplified format where it's still conveys the same information just more efficient.

259
00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:17.160
Usera, Daniel: You just want to be efficient, with PowerPoint you don't want to waste space you don't want to add things that can draw the audience's attention away from the points are trying to make.

260
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:30.210
Usera, Daniel: A good slides going to have good focus, so if I was doing this slide and i'm not the content expert of this person's capstone so once again i'm taking some liberties here, but if I was the content, if I assumed I was for a second.

261
00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.940
Usera, Daniel: One thing I could do.

262
00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:43.290
Usera, Daniel: Take the themes of the bullet points and just categorize them into larger themes and then give the larger theme category as your bullet point.

263
00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:55.560
Usera, Daniel: And then explain the subcategories Orly because remember the PowerPoint is you presenting it so it's okay if there's just the major category.

264
00:32:56.130 --> 00:33:12.600
Usera, Daniel: theme or header and then you can explain the the supporting information under it, this is a lot easier to follow, because this is a lot less to read that all this and each bullet point is really short and it acts as a prompt for me to have to talk off of and to say what I want to say.

265
00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:15.630
Okay.

266
00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:29.220
Usera, Daniel: All right, so that's one option for sure, but then, if I were to go another level i'm a huge fan of smart art and hopefully like when you watch the video lectures, if you haven't already.

267
00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:38.970
Usera, Daniel: smarter it's a beautiful thing because smart arts, you can use smart our list because essentially what this slide is this slide is a list right it's three disparate bullet points.

268
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:50.280
Usera, Daniel: So the conceptual relationship here that's being displayed or just three independent items, so in that case you can use a smart list, and so I would just do something like this and see here's what I did.

269
00:33:51.390 --> 00:34:01.200
Usera, Daniel: I put it in a sequential order so I said discovered the Why is probably the first thing right which probably enabled collaboration and then led to.

270
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:14.970
Usera, Daniel: affirmative a regional Vice President, responsibility and all of this is a good thing right, so I would want to sell this is not just business impact, but games because impacts can go both ways an impact can be negative or an impact can be positive.

271
00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:22.110
Usera, Daniel: If i'm wanting to say that my capstone projects going to have a positive impact, I don't want to call it, in fact I wanna call it gains, I want to emphasize the positive.

272
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:33.060
Usera, Daniel: So something like this still gets the point across and it shows it too, because it shows the relationship between the listed bullet points as opposed to just listing information.

273
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:49.920
Usera, Daniel: It establishes a relationship between all the nodes on the slide so that's what concept visually the concept visualization is about it's about taking concepts and visualizing the relationships between them, so you can make your point more quickly and rely less on text and more on digital's.

274
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:57.840
Usera, Daniel: Okay questions so far or concerns.

275
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:15.210
Wilson: Okay, so okay now quick question um are you going to see, but what is your take on animation and transitions.

276
00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:23.550
Usera, Daniel: So animations as far as making progressive slides I think animations are good for that.

277
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:33.840
Usera, Daniel: There are animations like spinning stuff that you probably don't want to use unless there's really a context for it, but your basic appear you're a basic fade your basic.

278
00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:40.680
Usera, Daniel: Just quick moving animation is totally fine to make a progressive slide and do we all remember what a progressive slide is.

279
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:58.260
Jim Clark: Okay, so that's the slide where you basically keep adding to the slide as you're moving it forward so you click you make a point you click and then something else comes into slide, and so it builds as you talk through it.

280
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.030
Usera, Daniel: Yes.

281
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.130
Wilson: So the rest of slide will stay.

282
00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:06.900
Usera, Daniel: With a small amount of information and then through clicks without changing slides it'll.

283
00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:11.910
Usera, Daniel: add more information so pretty much every slide deck i've ever done that's a progressive slide.

284
00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:13.890
Usera, Daniel: Now.

285
00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:18.480
Usera, Daniel: So animations are good for that and then some transitions are really good too.

286
00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:31.560
Usera, Daniel: And in the PowerPoint lecture you'll see like the power of like the morph transition and how it can create uniformity and the push left transition when you're doing like a timeline and you want the slides to look contiguous or continuous then.

287
00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:40.500
Usera, Daniel: push left transition can make the slide look like it's one slide when in fact it's too, so there, there is a context also for transitions as well.

288
00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:51.120
Usera, Daniel: So, but yes, not every feature on PowerPoint is one that you necessarily should use because, like there are some once again transitions that are probably too.

289
00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:57.600
Usera, Daniel: Too much motion for a zoom presentation, where it'll look choppy or animations that just take too long or kind of distracting so.

290
00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:07.200
Usera, Daniel: You kind of have to use judgment on which ones that you think are good or bad, but in principle animations and transitions can be a good thing, just.

291
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:16.260
Usera, Daniel: As long as there's judgment used as far as which ones you use does that make sense, so it's not a question of good or bad it's which ones you use and which ones, do you not use.

292
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:20.190
Wilson: yeah.

293
00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:31.620
Usera, Daniel: And then somebody asked about smart art so i'm a huge fan of smarter because it just it's it makes so many things simpler, because it just makes a template for you, for, especially for conceptual visualization so i'm a huge fan of it.

294
00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:48.240
Usera, Daniel: If, for some reason, but there are limitations to PowerPoint smart art, as far as sometimes they're not super customizable and then sometimes you can't make them progressive, in which case, then I resort to draw tools, so my best friends and PowerPoint or draw tools icons and smart arts.

295
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:56.130
Usera, Daniel: Because I want to conceptually visualize as much as I can, and realize little attacks as tax as possible, given what i'm trying to do.

296
00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:58.710
Usera, Daniel: Okay.

297
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.870
Usera, Daniel: All right next here's another slide.

298
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:06.270
Usera, Daniel: So what's good about this slide.

299
00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:11.370
Jim Clark: Well it's.

300
00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:19.320
Jim Clark: it's good it's good it's got lots of color in this guy white blue and red So you see patterns.

301
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:22.470
Jim Clark: So that's what I can say that's good.

302
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:24.720
Karen Fireman: yeah i'm actually really.

303
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.750
Karen Fireman: glad Dr Sarah could I ask a question it's Karen.

304
00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:28.500
Usera, Daniel: Okay.

305
00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:30.390
Karen Fireman: yeah I just heard some actually really.

306
00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:48.540
Karen Fireman: i'm actually really glad you showed this slide because, for most of us this does represent some of the work that we did, and one of the many models that we looked at and it's wonderful to see you talk about this, because if we're not supposed to show this, I really do want to know that.

307
00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.980
Usera, Daniel: Oh yeah you definitely have to show this your so part of your constraints.

308
00:38:53.340 --> 00:39:01.320
Usera, Daniel: As a PowerPoint it or as your career capstone is you're going to probably have to use screenshots as my understanding, you can't rename things on PowerPoint or excel.

309
00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:11.670
Usera, Daniel: or tablo or anything like that so you're probably going to have to show screenshots and so yeah that's one of your constraints, so we definitely don't want you to violate that constraint, so the question is.

310
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:13.230
Usera, Daniel: what's the best way to show.

311
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:16.290
Usera, Daniel: This, however, is there is there a way we can improve this slide.

312
00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:25.860
Nick Luthman: Right now, it feels like we're putting a bunch of things at once onto the screen so maybe sequence it.

313
00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:35.370
Usera, Daniel: Ah, OK so maybe sequence it maybe too much information travis said too much on one slide now here's one of my concerns with the slide.

314
00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:46.740
Usera, Daniel: Because you're relying heavily on screenshots it's not a problem this year, because most people are are going to be virtual I think your private messages are hundred percent virtual so.

315
00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:59.790
Usera, Daniel: On virtual presentations the viewing distance for the audience is like you know, two feet from the screen right for most virtual presentation, though people only said about to one to two feet away from their computer screens.

316
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:08.670
Usera, Daniel: But when you're presenting for alive large audience and a large room with a projector screen and that sometimes texts like this on a screen.

317
00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:18.840
Usera, Daniel: can be really hard to read and you might have been in those situations before where like you couldn't read the text because it was so small, because it comes from a screenshot like this, so.

318
00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:25.950
Usera, Daniel: One thing that you can do is separation so who called that who is that that that call that separating it out.

319
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.120
Usera, Daniel: If you don't want to have information overload on a slide and you want to have room to make things bigger just separate.

320
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:39.600
Usera, Daniel: So here's how I might redo this is, I have model, one linear regression i'm even going to have like a little preview picture of it.

321
00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:47.760
Usera, Daniel: And then i'll have the training side, Nice and big for you, you can read all the text, you can see, this is much bigger than what was seen on the previous slide.

322
00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:55.830
Usera, Daniel: And then, if I want this to show up later I can make this progressive if I want and then this will show up, you can read everything very clearly, can you not.

323
00:40:56.850 --> 00:41:01.080
Karen Fireman: And so, can I ask a question about it it's character so go back to the one before for a.

324
00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:01.560
Second.

325
00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:14.280
Karen Fireman: No, no, that one know the weren't you going to put i'm sorry did I miss that one so we're making two slides out of it we're having that and the next one on this one model, this one point that is.

326
00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:14.910
well.

327
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:23.640
Usera, Daniel: yeah, so this is a sectional slide, so this is just introducing the model, so this was just a nice little pretty cover slide for it.

328
00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:34.200
Usera, Daniel: So then, if you were showing the data, you would separate it into two slides so we're going to have this be nice and big and you can talk through it, you can say here's what I did for training.

329
00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:45.450
Usera, Daniel: And then here's what I did for validation and then you can talk about it show us if you don't need to spend a lot of time on it, if it's just like a two second thing a three second thing that's Okay, at least we can still see it, and we can read it.

330
00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:51.000
Usera, Daniel: And then, if you want to add a thesis at the top, you can put a thesis at the top.

331
00:41:51.210 --> 00:42:00.540
Usera, Daniel: The model trains and validates a significance level or whatever the thesis is i'm not sure what the what the thesis is, in this case, but let's just say it was that, but the thesis at the top.

332
00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:19.050
Usera, Daniel: And then Compare that to this, you can see, you can read that part better and then you'll probably ask about this well we'll get to this in a second, but you understand how bigger is better and then plus at these at the top very easy to talk through.

333
00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:29.130
Usera, Daniel: Now, if you have slide limits, then you got to think slide economy.

334
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:36.060
Usera, Daniel: If there's some slides where you think I think it's Okay, if this is all in one slide because i'm not gonna.

335
00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.610
Usera, Daniel: i'm not really expecting them to take everything in.

336
00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:49.740
Usera, Daniel: or I just i'm going to give them five or 10 seconds to read everything, so what you're going to do is when you have a long quote slide or large data slider so i'm going to give you a couple seconds to look at this so just go ahead and take a look.

337
00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:56.130
Usera, Daniel: You know, take a SIP of the drink let people look at it okay so here's what you probably should have seen if, when you look at this side.

338
00:42:56.700 --> 00:43:03.600
Usera, Daniel: You see this, and if you see look at this chart you should see that, and so what I did was I took that and I took this and then I got to this conclusion.

339
00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:17.940
Usera, Daniel: So, think of them as long quote slides so in PowerPoint, how do you handle long quote slides give them time ask somebody to read it or read it yourself, so in this case with data probably give them some time to look at it.

340
00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:21.690
Usera, Daniel: But yes you're gonna have to think slide economy for sure.

341
00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:32.160
Usera, Daniel: Now the last technique is sequential ization let's say for slide economy reasons you don't you can't separate everything the way you want to.

342
00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:36.300
Usera, Daniel: So you have to put everything on one slide or let's say that.

343
00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:47.130
Usera, Daniel: For people to really understand the data that they're looking at, they have to have a holistic picture like they have to see everything at once on one page otherwise like they'll miss something.

344
00:43:47.400 --> 00:44:00.240
Usera, Daniel: So I understand, sometimes losing that strategic view could be a loss Okay, if you have to that if you have to squeeze everything on one slide, and this is like a last resort, but it can work.

345
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:07.920
Usera, Daniel: So start out by just telling the story of whatever the data you're showing so you can say a few outliers found with the if under 10.

346
00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:17.190
Usera, Daniel: And then talk through the first point, and still make it big you know you can still read it, you can read the text and then talk through the second point, as you go through the second one.

347
00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:20.370
Usera, Daniel: And then talk through the third one, as you go through the third one.

348
00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:28.080
Usera, Daniel: And then, when you're done with that then talk to before now, if I took some liberties here i'm not an expert i'm not a content expert on what's important what's not.

349
00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:44.940
Usera, Daniel: But if I were to try to fit it in and try to make it big that's probably what I would do and then just sequentially reveal each point, as I go and then let the audience take it in that next thing, let them take it in next thing, so we go back to that principle of you're feeding a child.

350
00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:55.350
Usera, Daniel: Doing PowerPoint especially data like this stuff that's difficult to understand stuff that you have to really look at and to really process is like feeding a child.

351
00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:07.440
Usera, Daniel: You put some food in the child's mouth you let them to you let them swallow, then you put some more food in what you don't do is dump the whole baby jar onto the baby's mouth, because they choke and the audience chokes if you try to dump too much information.

352
00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:10.260
Usera, Daniel: Now.

353
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:20.910
Usera, Daniel: In this is where going back to transitions So if I want to do, like a continuous slide, this is a push left so if if people are like well I need to see the.

354
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:27.540
Usera, Daniel: The training and validation okay well you just go back and forth between the two, and then you can look at training and validation that way.

355
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:36.300
Usera, Daniel: And that's pretty much it so In summary, simplification separation and sequential ization.

356
00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:45.180
Usera, Daniel: simplify try to categorize things put things in categories have the larger points and then you talk through the points separation.

357
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:52.170
Usera, Daniel: If you can separate some things so you can make the screenshots bigger and more legible and give them thesis and data and that time of day.

358
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:55.980
Usera, Daniel: And then separate them so they can there can be more focused on the slide great.

359
00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:05.850
Usera, Daniel: If you can't separate then sequential eyes and then talk through each important data point that you need to talk through and then tell and then you kind of tell a data story, as you go through each slide.

360
00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:17.010
Usera, Daniel: And you can paste it out to if one side is sort of like a premise slide where it's not important, but it's like it's just a small premise, then you can time it so you only spend five six seconds on it.

361
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:26.430
Usera, Daniel: As far as like your practice your time your practice that way, so you just give a quick, short explanation, so we can see it, and then, so you can spend more time on the bigger the bigger fish, if you will.

362
00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:32.070
Usera, Daniel: But those would be the three things I would recommend that you do in your PowerPoint.

363
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.690
Usera, Daniel: Okay.

364
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:39.780
Usera, Daniel: Questions about it or concerns do so if you have concerns, I don't know like this is time to also bring up concerns to.

365
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.310
Usera, Daniel: or ask questions or for further ideas or.

366
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.170
Nick Luthman: So i've never used.

367
00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:50.580
Karen Fireman: Good.

368
00:46:51.840 --> 00:47:06.900
Nick Luthman: So, you mentioned the term smart art and you showed, there were kind of those as like the organizational diagram and a few things they kind of show what the spirit of the blurb was is that something that's built into PowerPoint or are there collected those.

369
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:12.780
Usera, Daniel: So, right here on PowerPoint let's go to smart art and then you have different types of conceptual relationships.

370
00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:21.720
Usera, Daniel: So this is where visual grammar comes into play, you have to know exactly how the data relates, and then you got to know what's the appropriate diagrams and use.

371
00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:37.590
Usera, Daniel: So is it like some kind of mutually influential relationship or one or is it a process is a cyclical relationship or it's a cycle, where it goes over and over, then you would do something like this it's more like well it's not like a cycle, but it's more like.

372
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:44.310
Usera, Daniel: Perhaps it's a hierarchy like one things important or.

373
00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:55.140
Usera, Daniel: it's it's a three it's like a mutual influence it's like a triad like it goes through both all three directions that kind of thing, and you can also make it for you can add you know, and all that stuff too, if you want.

374
00:47:55.650 --> 00:48:04.110
Usera, Daniel: So you have to really know what exactly it is you're trying to say and that's the beauty of visual grammar and concept visualization is it forces you to think.

375
00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:15.030
Usera, Daniel: How what exactly, am I trying to say and how can I show i'm trying to say so, I just saw a presentation, the other day for a case competition, and I was helping this team practice and they used.

376
00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:20.670
Usera, Daniel: Infrastructure leads so fast, so what they use listening, a new slide so you don't get you can see everything.

377
00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:37.530
Usera, Daniel: And let me make this blank actually Okay, so this this presenter was talking about how she was a connector of things, and she saw herself as making a lot of connections, the smart art she used.

378
00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:50.070
Usera, Daniel: Was this and she said i'm a connector I connect science, art and like no just these five different topics it was like four different topics, but, basically, I saw connection between this this and this.

379
00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:59.100
Usera, Daniel: But technically this doesn't necessarily show connection that you make those connections, this can show that these are self connecting.

380
00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:14.400
Usera, Daniel: If you want to show that you the individual or the connector, then what you probably want to use I would think in that case is something like this, where you're at the Center or something like this.

381
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:19.380
Usera, Daniel: where you have you connecting the four different things.

382
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:24.000
Usera, Daniel: You see, because if you compare this.

383
00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:27.210
Usera, Daniel: To the previous one.

384
00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:39.840
Usera, Daniel: Some reasons one replaced it sorry if you compare that to the previous one, you can draw different implications about what it means to be a connector right.

385
00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:52.680
Usera, Daniel: So it's like those subtle things that you just don't think about as far as like yeah what am I trying to say and what would lead to the right impression, and how do you prevent the myth, the more of a misinterpretation.

386
00:49:54.570 --> 00:50:01.110
Usera, Daniel: So that's that's the beauty of concept visualization but then you can see the points quicker because it's visual it's not textual.

387
00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:11.370
Usera, Daniel: Okay, are there any other PowerPoint questions, by the way, like technical questions like how do I do X or Y or Z.

388
00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:14.970
Usera, Daniel: If I can answer those as well.

389
00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:21.840
Usera, Daniel: And then, let me give you a something that I guess students really appreciate whenever I teach it okay so.

390
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:31.440
Usera, Daniel: When you make your deck I highly recommend you make your own theme, make a theme that makes sense, with the topic that you're presenting.

391
00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:35.700
Usera, Daniel: For these capstones you're presenting for company right about a company.

392
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:44.820
Usera, Daniel: To me automatically, it makes sense to probably use the company's colors you know if the company is green white use green and white, because you're presenting on behalf of that company.

393
00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:51.870
Usera, Daniel: But if, like the industry is interesting, like maybe you're presenting for sports maybe you're presenting for nfl or something, are you presenting for.

394
00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:56.220
Usera, Daniel: St patrick's day then yeah green makes sense because it's about pay patrick's day I mean.

395
00:50:56.790 --> 00:51:08.880
Usera, Daniel: pick something that makes sense, with the topic what you don't want to do is use a generic template that you've seen 30 times already so droplets are like the weird ones with the colors and the abstracts on the top now.

396
00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:17.220
Usera, Daniel: When you make your slide my favorite thing ever saved a lot of time is the slide master you go to view and you go to slide master here.

397
00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:21.960
Usera, Daniel: And with the slide master if you go the top slide This is like the top hierarchical slide.

398
00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:30.810
Usera, Daniel: You can make it so that you don't have to keep going back each time to change your slot to make a slight theme, so this is going to create a whole template for you.

399
00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:37.890
Usera, Daniel: And really easily, I want to stay away from these things because we've seen all of these a jillion times and this shows low effort.

400
00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:45.720
Usera, Daniel: Just think Okay, what makes sense for my presentation color wise is my company like on the green side on the yellow side the orange side.

401
00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:57.690
Usera, Daniel: Like what colors do you associate with your topic so let's just say we're going to do that, and you know just you can just do a little phil color here you don't have to or sorry that was a text color let me go to.

402
00:51:58.710 --> 00:52:07.620
Usera, Daniel: feel color here Okay, so you can do like a shape fill color here, and then you can do like a little blue if you want, I mean i'm just making up something as I go.

403
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:13.830
Usera, Daniel: And then you know, change the text color there you go Okay, so we got some color going on all right.

404
00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:20.280
Usera, Daniel: And maybe you want to keep that way I don't know light on lights and that usually not good, so you probably want to stay to a dark so you do like a dark blue.

405
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:25.200
Usera, Daniel: And of course calibrates the default font let's let's go something besides default.

406
00:52:25.770 --> 00:52:38.880
Usera, Daniel: Well, what font makes sense for what you're trying to present about oh no what's a good fun that represents or speaks to the theme that you're speaking about okay I don't know I don't know it depends on the presentation so maybe yeah not we use.

407
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:56.160
Usera, Daniel: comic sans okay if you're you know comic sans a kind of informal type So if you think this is like a fun do comic sans so here's the thing fonts type geography is voice for text, just like how early, we have a voice that.

408
00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:00.870
Usera, Daniel: highlights a specific emotion or idea.

409
00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:12.900
Usera, Daniel: fonts also are a voice for text so think about that, like what's the voice that you want your text to have and what font best represents the voice that you want it to have.

410
00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:21.150
Usera, Daniel: You guys are doing comic sans okay fine and then you can do things on the background, if you want to have a nice background, you can do something there.

411
00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:29.580
Usera, Daniel: I mean there's all kinds of stuff we do play with the side nicer now here's the beauty of the slide master one thing I recommend is before we get to the beauty of the slide master.

412
00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:35.070
Usera, Daniel: For technical presentations because that's what you all, are doing, I recommend that you have.

413
00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:41.370
Usera, Daniel: slide numbers at the bottom of your of your slides so you do is header footer slide number.

414
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:52.800
Usera, Daniel: The reason you want to have slide numbers is because, when, at the end of the presentation it's time to do Q amp a it's so much easier if you can just say, can you please go to slide seven as opposed to.

415
00:53:52.980 --> 00:54:01.050
Usera, Daniel: Can you go back to that one slide with that one chart is the one it's a person, then you have to click through you know you don't talking about and it's just a real pain to do Q amp a.

416
00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:14.250
Usera, Daniel: slide number at the bottom, you know and it'll look Nice and we're going to do that okay now here's the beauty of the slide master when we're done with it we just go to slide master and we close it.

417
00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:24.750
Usera, Daniel: And then now whenever I make a new slide it's already made and the color and the font and the scheme that i've already established early on.

418
00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:32.670
Usera, Daniel: you're not going back and having a great color everything and you made your own template and it's not the one that we've seen 30 times already from the defaults.

419
00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:44.760
Usera, Daniel: And now it looks original and now it looks creative and now it looks like he put some effort into it, you put some thought into it all you're going to have some good in it you're gonna make a good impression just on image alone and that's how you went audiences.

420
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:55.380
Usera, Daniel: Okay, did you all see that y'all see I did that it's under view and then slide master the slide masters your best friend well, you have a lot of best friends and power by your side master is a great friend for sure.

421
00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:00.570
Usera, Daniel: Any other technical questions about PowerPoint.

422
00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:11.400
Shadi Kilani: So, just a quick question when you were saying low effort and all of this, are you referring to the design healthcare thing is that what you're referring to.

423
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.770
Usera, Daniel: yeah you know, like people like it.

424
00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:23.760
Shadi Kilani: Because you know design ideas that you're not necessarily just clicking and you know it takes a lot of thought, sometimes in some of these effects, I don't know how to do.

425
00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:27.810
Shadi Kilani: You have you have relied on that I know I know what you mean you don't want to sound like.

426
00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.690
Shadi Kilani: You don't want to have the same icons like everyone else, and.

427
00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:34.140
Usera, Daniel: yeah so does it gets gets interesting because.

428
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:45.270
Usera, Daniel: When you make your own theme sometimes design ideas will do something that's in that that is consistent with your theme and then, in which case you can use it.

429
00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:53.820
Usera, Daniel: But sometimes his ideas comes up like it doesn't honor your theme, so you have one slide that looks a certain way, and then design ideas of different color different font.

430
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:57.450
Usera, Daniel: So it's okay uses idea, sometimes I think.

431
00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:08.610
Usera, Daniel: I wouldn't make your whole presentation design does because it's not always going to do what you wanted to do, the problem is designed us to they're not super modifiable sometimes I see a design idea i'm like Oh, I like that, but I can't change this thing, so I can't use it.

432
00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:14.970
Shadi Kilani: yeah it has limitations you're right times, if I like a certain thing I would duplicate the slide and then.

433
00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:26.370
Shadi Kilani: Because you're like it's not consistent it doesn't really suggest the same theme across and you could have one going to the life and the other one going to the left yeah you can't just use it as is right.

434
00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:32.250
Usera, Daniel: So and that's why I mean that's why I think it's better to learn how to make your own themes, because then you have all the control.

435
00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:39.240
Usera, Daniel: So, and once again what most people do when they're not experienced PowerPoint they just go straight to this and then that's what you end up seeing.

436
00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:54.270
Usera, Daniel: A lot of times, and so what I want you all to use and stand out a little more by having your own design that you control and you have all the same, and you're not a slave to the template or you're not you know subservient to the design against.

437
00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:57.240
Shadi Kilani: Is that if we made some edits.

438
00:56:57.570 --> 00:56:59.280
Shadi Kilani: Are we able to update what we.

439
00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:02.550
Shadi Kilani: Because I think you know I want to get your feedback on my latest.

440
00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:16.500
Shadi Kilani: slide deck and i'm sure other colleagues have already or you're willing to open up the turning in of the slides So if I have a newer one because I made a lot of updates since the last time so whatever feedback you give me now might not be as relevant to us.

441
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:26.910
Usera, Daniel: yeah i've only looked at I just started I just opened them today, I didn't look that one I think I looked at one just actually looked at one yesterday, I think that I haven't looked at any so.

442
00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:32.310
Usera, Daniel: If you want to withdraw, I think you can withdraw your submission and then just upload a new one.

443
00:57:33.090 --> 00:57:45.990
Usera, Daniel: it's because i'm probably and even tomorrow I probably be able to look till tomorrow evenings we have consulting challenge tomorrow so yeah again if you want to just I think I think the settings on blackboard alive you that if they don't let me know and then we'll make it happen.

444
00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:46.830
Usera, Daniel: If you.

445
00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:51.270
Usera, Daniel: did your best stuff I want to see whatever you have that's good and all that.

446
00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:59.970
Karen Fireman: Data to Syrians Karen I guess concerns I have a little bit of a concern, some of us have been building our slide decks for the last 14 or 13 months.

447
00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:08.520
Karen Fireman: And we've already built them we've already got our theme we've already got you know we're one minute away we're at 1159 and 30 seconds and you're telling us to redo the whole thing.

448
00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:12.120
Karen Fireman: pretty much are.

449
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:14.220
Usera, Daniel: Well, I mean just saying like look.

450
00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:15.150
Karen Fireman: At other concern.

451
00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:24.750
Usera, Daniel: I mean it with the site master you can go, you can do it retroactively to so you don't have to redo all your your text in your you don't have to redo all your graphs and such.

452
00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:35.880
Usera, Daniel: When you do the slide nice right, you should be able to apply it to all the slides you made so it would just change the colors of everything you might have to do a quick audit of the new slides of it once you apply it.

453
00:58:36.330 --> 00:58:37.590
Karen Fireman: By mainly what we have.

454
00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:42.810
Usera, Daniel: we're like what you have to the neck, like, I just want you to like what you have so i'm just giving you ideas so.

455
00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:51.330
Usera, Daniel: You know, like I said I recommend make your own template because I think it'll look good it'll it'll show that you know tie into the company you don't have to have the problems of.

456
00:58:51.930 --> 00:59:08.250
Usera, Daniel: being limited by a certain template that you didn't make that kind of stuff so you know it's all optional and according to Meijer, I guess there's a basic MSA template already so you can use that but it doesn't take that much time, I mean you saw be just a very basic template.

457
00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:22.380
Usera, Daniel: Just about once I talked so I mean it's up to you it's up to you at the end, the day I just want to see you what's more important to me is that your slides are simplified separated and sequential eyes.

458
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:30.660
Usera, Daniel: i'm like more interested in that and that you're good at communicating the ideas, clearly and quickly.

459
00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:45.600
Usera, Daniel: So that's your goal and out of this quickly and clearly what's the point every slide quickly and clearly these is at the top down at the bottom, these are the top down at the bottom what's the point at the top here's the support thesis support.

460
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:58.530
Usera, Daniel: So yeah don't don't get too caught up on themes inside if you're already all the way through, then you know you're all the way through, but if you want to go back and you know put that extra step in and.

461
00:59:59.850 --> 01:00:08.730
Usera, Daniel: Give it give it a look, give a nice look, I mean the slide master like I said, can be applied retroactively so and then you just have to go through and make sure everything looks good, and if you have to.

462
01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:13.020
Usera, Daniel: rearrange some furniture or rearranging furniture, but it's not you don't have to start from zero.

463
01:00:14.970 --> 01:00:15.630
Usera, Daniel: That makes sense.

464
01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:29.400
Wilson: He does professor at things I mean you know very nice tips, I have to go and read their minds, you realize that I was too wordy and and to hear me.

465
01:00:30.930 --> 01:00:31.440
Usera, Daniel: say it again.

466
01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:42.870
Wilson: I just realized this conversation that has too many wars and also was too much information and he says, I so it was very helpful to to release my slides.

467
01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:49.650
Usera, Daniel: Oh good good good yeah and so at the end of the day, there's going to be times when you might have to be a little bit testy like.

468
01:00:49.860 --> 01:01:01.260
Usera, Daniel: When you show law or you show policy you can't visualize law like you can't visualize the fourth amendment with like a lock and key or something like you have to show the text right, so I don't want to say all text is bad.

469
01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:09.180
Usera, Daniel: But it's just we try to limit the amount of text too much text too much reading as bad as what we are trying to get away from and being visual is good.

470
01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:14.400
Usera, Daniel: So that's where we want to be, because after all it's a visual aid, not a textual eight.

471
01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:18.480
Usera, Daniel: it's better for the audience to see it than to read it.

472
01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:25.380
Usera, Daniel: Okay okay right seven o'clock I don't want to take the.

473
01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:37.020
Usera, Daniel: festers time but I appreciate all the questions I always love presenting to Ms analytics you all have great comments there's always some humor in the chat the other class to they have some funny people in there, too, so it's always a.

474
01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:45.840
Usera, Daniel: So there's that must be like a personality thing or something and they'll asked great questions, so I look forward to what you all do and i'll start looking at it tomorrow evening.

475
01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:57.150
Usera, Daniel: late afternoon, if you want to resubmit resubmit but my goal with your feedback is to just help you get better give you ideas on the non technical guy so listen to your coach, whatever your coach tells you is probably right.

476
01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:07.380
Usera, Daniel: To so you know you'll have to negotiate some things you have to negotiate some things but that's that's the that's the life of a communicator is you get a lot of opinions.

477
01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:10.260
Charles Swanson: Thank you very much.

478
01:02:10.650 --> 01:02:15.360
Usera, Daniel: yeah Thank you and thank you for all the great questions and I will look forward to seeing you all soon.

479
01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:16.890
Shadi Kilani: Thank you.

480
01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:18.870
Usera, Daniel: yep can I.

481
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:20.340
MS Analytics Class 2021: All right, thank you.

482
01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:20.940
Karen Fireman: Thank you.

483

Brian Frankel: Thank you.

484
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:28.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: alright.

485
01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:35.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: hey Brian you're real big on the screen for a second alright, so I need to get everything set up over here on the screen.

486
01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:41.910
MS Analytics Class 2021: That was probably a lot to digest i'm sure you want to break for 10 minutes so it's five after let's start at 715.

487
01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:51.480
MS Analytics Class 2021: And we'll go to nine we'll talk about data bricks of have time i'll show you some stuff and azure but if I don't have time i'll just add it to the video i'm going to make for you forget and devops.

488
01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:58.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: And already have a plasma show you already have recorded all the stuff i'm going to make a video already have recorded so i'm going to put it all together for you.

489
01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:07.920
MS Analytics Class 2021: And one video and upload it but take two minute break some 15 will start give me a second just to get my slides and everything up over here and we'll we'll start back in.

490
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:11.040
MS Analytics Class 2021: And 10 minutes.

491
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:19.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: So under the just real quick, I noticed that Dr hartman who will have you starting next Thursday.

492
01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:28.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: Hello pick it up y'all hear me it's on, I know, but the gap very well.

493
01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.140
Amanda Pham: We can hear you.

494
01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:33.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: can hear me Okay, thank you remember.

495
01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:35.400
Jim Clark: me loud and clear.

496
01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:45.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: All right, perfect thanks thanks Joe alright, so I noticed Dr hartman put out a syllabus update for his half of the class and if you click on that.

497
01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.170
MS Analytics Class 2021: you'll notice that my phone is ringing from a thing right here.

498
01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:57.150
MS Analytics Class 2021: At the ratio of Sorry, I have to reshare one second we're sharing over here.

499
01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:04.290
MS Analytics Class 2021: I know how to share not over yet I still find that that's got to find the the one where it was me share.

500
01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: yeah I think it is.

501
01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:18.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: I think it is no I moved over here, why is it not coming up sorry you having some technical difficulties.

502
01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:30.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: i'm not sure why yeah you can just say what all, let me pull this back.

503
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:45.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: Oh yeah sorry sorry I was looking for was that little that little thing there okay sorry guys and gals the zoom was hidden hiding behind me I don't know how it got shared.

504
01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:47.160
Okay.

505
01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:58.350
MS Analytics Class 2021: And we're sharing screen one hi okay sorry somebody in the sheer went away I don't know why okay so y'all can see the screen now, thank you.

506
01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:06.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, all right so um Dr hartman put out this.

507
01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:16.890
MS Analytics Class 2021: ignore that that's what I want to point out is he's changed a little bit of his stuff just for his that that part that says, Dr hartman's half.

508
01:05:17.370 --> 01:05:30.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: This look at that half for his what your new for him he'll he'll explain all that I was going to get it, I just don't want you to look at this and see oh wait, I thought you said, there is no assignment dude right three yeah that's still true, for my part of the class.

509
01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:46.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is the syllabus you want to worry about right so, for my part of the class and you can see, Simon three is canceled canceled I give you all 100 I don't want to I don't want to like if I think he's cutting one out to just because of things and so.

510
01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:59.940
MS Analytics Class 2021: I don't want to cut it out that's not fair to you all to only give you three assignments so i'm going to give you all hundreds for that one, and then only thing you have left is project, one which will be about data bricks and so that'll be due on.

511
01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:12.300
MS Analytics Class 2021: And that being said so follow you that turn your homework and on time for wanting to thank you, you all can get a full hundred percent credit for those of you who didn't you'll want to turn homework on into and.

512
01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:27.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: And and i'll give you to the 18th I will take 10 points off, but an it is better than zero so, especially when you start getting optimization You see, you have 12345 you have quite a few assignments, I promise you they'll be harder so.

513
01:06:28.290 --> 01:06:35.700
MS Analytics Class 2021: I know you all have a lot going on with storms those you live in Houston area with capstones and calvin's and work and everything so.

514
01:06:36.690 --> 01:06:44.700
MS Analytics Class 2021: Understand that For those of you that go on time, you get a full hundred percent credit, as far as the possibility of getting 100 itself degrade them.

515
01:06:45.570 --> 01:06:52.320
MS Analytics Class 2021: But for those that are late i'll take 10 points off i'll give you the 18th to turn them in but I highly recommend you tournament.

516
01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:55.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: Just because you know how things go as you get on the rest of.

517
01:06:56.460 --> 01:07:02.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: The semester you're gonna get very excited at the end, and you might not want to do the last homework and then you're like man I wish i'd done it easy homework.

518
01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:09.390
MS Analytics Class 2021: That Dr Johnston gave us and Python so now, I have to do this hard one for Dr hartman for optimization.

519
01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:13.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: Because it is a little bit harder because it's something that's going to be new probably little different for you then.

520
01:07:14.850 --> 01:07:29.370
MS Analytics Class 2021: So That being said, I haven't read your homework, I promise i'll get it done this weekend, I think, tomorrow, he can't put this down, so I won't go do it tomorrow, but I won't get it done this weekend assignments one and two, and so, but i'm sure you're all did well so.

521
01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:34.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: All right, so let's get started we'll jump into.

522
01:07:36.450 --> 01:07:38.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: To data bricks and.

523
01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:46.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: And let's go, so I get the PowerPoint backup y'all can see that just fine, let me see if the clicker works.

524
01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:50.910
MS Analytics Class 2021: yeah it works alright cool i'll see that okay.

525
01:07:52.380 --> 01:08:02.250
MS Analytics Class 2021: All right, so welcome howdy like I said earlier, for those of you that joined a minute late after the break this is my last class with you i've really enjoyed.

526
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:04.590
MS Analytics Class 2021: All you've been great.

527
01:08:05.970 --> 01:08:20.490
MS Analytics Class 2021: and participating and listening and so hopefully you learned a lot I do owe you one more class that I will record, you can watch it at your leisure, I will recommend you know don't forget to download all this all the videos and all that before it before you check out of here in May.

528
01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:33.300
MS Analytics Class 2021: Because this stuff's still relevant hopefully when you leave so data bricks week seven so here's an outline talk about patchy spark a little bit about what it is.

529
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:34.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: introduction to data bricks.

530
01:08:34.770 --> 01:08:42.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: pi spark blah blah, this is the boring slide that Dr you Sarah just said don't have.

531
01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:51.180
MS Analytics Class 2021: to outline boring like i've already lost you so we'll just go right into what we're talking about and I go so Apache spark So what is it.

532
01:08:51.660 --> 01:09:10.890
MS Analytics Class 2021: So Apache spark was a product, I believe, on a Berkeley uc Berkeley I used to always know that, but I just forgot, but it was a project to basically build a super high performance large scale data processing analytics engine as part of the ecosystem, so it was called Apache spark.

533
01:09:12.450 --> 01:09:16.140
MS Analytics Class 2021: Data bricks, which is what i'm in mostly what i'm going to focus on tonight.

534
01:09:16.770 --> 01:09:30.660
MS Analytics Class 2021: showing you how that works is built off Apache spark so the people that design Apache spark this high performance multi node clustering super high scale data processing analytics you know model building.

535
01:09:31.230 --> 01:09:45.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: A product, the people that built that started a company called data bricks and so data bricks is a web only based so it runs in the you interface, and you do everything from the web.

536
01:09:47.010 --> 01:09:57.480
MS Analytics Class 2021: browser it runs in the cloud so it's a cloud only product so there's not like a what we call on premise there's not a version that runs inside of your data Center per se right.

537
01:09:58.230 --> 01:10:10.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: It all runs in azure as Amazon web services azure and as of two, three weeks ago, Google cloud platform, so all three cloud port platforms support data bricks.

538
01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:22.320
MS Analytics Class 2021: They all work and look about the same between the three clouds so data bricks is its own company and they use the azure the Amazon the Google cloud platform.

539
01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:29.040
MS Analytics Class 2021: To run their product time and so in every one of those companies Google Amazon and Microsoft.

540
01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:34.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: treat it as a first classes and like it's their own it's like it's one of their own type of products right so.

541
01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:48.930
MS Analytics Class 2021: It doesn't get like less special treatment because it's not a Google product or an Amazon product or an azure product it's treated as a first class citizen in those cloud environments and gets special love and attention just like every other you know product that runs in the cloud.

542
01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:50.910
MS Analytics Class 2021: So.

543
01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:57.180
MS Analytics Class 2021: It is again so you will see.

544
01:10:58.530 --> 01:11:07.110
MS Analytics Class 2021: Apache spark and different hadoop environments and different things that people built data bricks is not a one for one of Apache spark.

545
01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:15.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: What they what they do is they contribute to open source Apache spark is an open source product data bricks as a company is like the major contributor.

546
01:11:15.450 --> 01:11:23.280
MS Analytics Class 2021: To that Apache spark Open Source product that you can go and download and use for free and and whatnot and run into do clusters, or by itself.

547
01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:30.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: But they hold back some of their special sauce and special features just for their data bricks products so.

548
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: Last week I mentioned a product called as your sin Apps analytics I showed you a slide.

549
01:11:37.710 --> 01:11:44.340
MS Analytics Class 2021: It will run a patchy spark it doesn't run data bricks inside of azure and sin Apps analytics it actually runs the open source.

550
01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:55.050
MS Analytics Class 2021: Apache spark so the code and all that looks pretty much the same, I mean it does look the same it's pie spark or scala or our sparkly our Python.

551
01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:04.170
MS Analytics Class 2021: All the codes, the same it's just they have some extra features and different things that data bricks has, on top of the standard Apache spark that they put into.

552
01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:15.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: flexi Cameron that they put out into the open source world they have some special things that are run a little faster and and how they implement their workspaces and all that i'll show you this in a second.

553
01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:33.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: You know they have a whole wrapper around how the product works and it's all built to run Nice and tight inside the Web inside these cloud environments is what data bricks so data bricks is Apache spark and more so to speak, so we'll go through the different components so.

554
01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:48.150
MS Analytics Class 2021: So gentle introduction of data so i'm just going to jump in and start demoing it and show you a little bit of it looks like go through some more slides DEMO some more code so i'm going to take and.

555
01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:51.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: open up this link here.

556
01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:56.760
MS Analytics Class 2021: let's move this all the way here.

557
01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:02.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: find my chrome.

558
01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.480
MS Analytics Class 2021: No worry about these links cuz.

559
01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:18.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: worry about the link and piping i'll show you in a second that I have this all written down for you.

560
01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:25.530
MS Analytics Class 2021: I just want to get the product open, I meant to open this at the break.

561
01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:32.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: When I forgot to open when I was like I hope and everything, but one thing so don't say.

562
01:13:34.230 --> 01:13:36.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: go away bookmarks alright so.

563
01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let me get this split out so i'm going to.

564
01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: split up these screens, so I can see them.

565
01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:49.290
MS Analytics Class 2021: Alright, so.

566
01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:54.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: I have this general introduction to Apache spark open up right here.

567
01:13:55.590 --> 01:14:08.400
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then over here on the right side, right here, this is the Community free edition of data, so the cool thing about data REX is they give you access to go set up and run.

568
01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:15.690
MS Analytics Class 2021: Your own free version of data bricks and the cloud know in the Community edition it actually runs in Amazon web services.

569
01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:27.120
MS Analytics Class 2021: In this it's a free like it's one or two node cluster that you can run, and so it will run for two hours and then, if you're not using it it'll shut down and terminate.

570
01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:35.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: But all the cool stuff is is the cool thing is is everything will still stay in your workspace, then the communication data bricks and you can go back.

571
01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:48.450
MS Analytics Class 2021: And restart up your restart up a new cluster and work with your code so i'm gonna walk through what all that well, that means in like what each things as far as the cluster but the thing is cool thing is like said you'll be able to use this you don't need to put a credit card.

572
01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:56.280
MS Analytics Class 2021: In the in the downloads I have a word Doc that's for your project and the project.

573
01:14:56.670 --> 01:15:06.450
MS Analytics Class 2021: Word Doc I literally walk wine pipeline what you need to do to complete the project, including how to go the weight and the link to go and set up the free edition of data bricks i'll just show you actually instead of.

574
01:15:06.930 --> 01:15:15.930
MS Analytics Class 2021: Talking, let me just show you because I have it open here so i'm not going to talk about the project just yet, and my site project is really just homework but.

575
01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:24.180
MS Analytics Class 2021: But just to show you like, I have go to hear set up the Community edition and spring strong sign up with your taboo, you know.

576
01:15:24.930 --> 01:15:33.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: create a cluster I walk you through everything you know use this important in you know do all this i'ma show you all this DEMO in a second, but what.

577
01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:40.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: I want to make right now is is I literally give you, step by step directions like you're reading a blog post of like, how can I.

578
01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:48.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: You know, create my first data bricks project, you know and put my data and right so literally, this is, this is the homework and six pages.

579
01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:54.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: you'll walk through it and it's really the same type of thing you're going to import my example red wine data quality thing.

580
01:15:55.230 --> 01:16:04.320
MS Analytics Class 2021: And you're going to make it your own by using your own data set right and so we'll come back to this, but what I want to just let you know and see is, I have the link to get to the free communication I have.

581
01:16:04.710 --> 01:16:14.370
MS Analytics Class 2021: The setup instructions on how to to install it so if the screenshots are slightly different you know, they should be about right but.

582
01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:29.160
MS Analytics Class 2021: That means actually close that but, so in this browser I mean in this and not here this is this link here, this is just data bricks little general in general introduction to data bricks.

583
01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:32.070
MS Analytics Class 2021: And the cool thing is is.

584
01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:45.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is actually technically a data bricks notebook and so you can actually import this in and even have some code and stuff die here play with but.

585
01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:56.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: we'll come back to that so let's go through here and walk through just a few things so some terminology, the main thing i'll talk about us terminology right so when you go to this Community edition of data bricks.

586
01:16:56.910 --> 01:17:03.180
MS Analytics Class 2021: And you sign up for your free account and you log in it's going to look like this, and this is going to be your.

587
01:17:05.070 --> 01:17:19.680
MS Analytics Class 2021: Your home and your workspace and the thing you notice over the right is this little bar right and so you're going to have a workspace some recency or have data and have things, called clusters you're gonna have jobs come search.

588
01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:36.450
MS Analytics Class 2021: And the workspaces what allow you to organize your work, so you think of a workspace as like a folder structure that has all your information, so in this case, when I go to this workspace.

589
01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:44.370
MS Analytics Class 2021: I have my users in this case it's just me, I believe the Community edition allows up the three users.

590
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:51.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you can, if you guys wanted to share and play around with each other and find each other to your Community edition.

591
01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:59.760
MS Analytics Class 2021: of data bricks you can invite to other people, and you can collaborate and one of the things you'll we'll talk about here in a second notebooks is.

592
01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:04.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: You can actually have three, you can have mean in the Community, because you only have three people in.

593
01:18:05.130 --> 01:18:14.550
MS Analytics Class 2021: But, like in the one I have like my data bricks at my office there's not a limit like that, and so you can have four or five six people editing one notebook at the same time, and they can be editing different cells.

594
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:23.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: Because it's all cloud based and all management, so if you've used like office online and anybody anybody use like excel online or you know.

595
01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:41.250
MS Analytics Class 2021: PowerPoint online where you're not actually in the excel desktop APP you're actually using Microsoft excel if you notice if it's through office 365 or now Microsoft 365 but you're on the office 365 using cell line multiple people could be in the same sheet editing it right, so if you.

596
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:47.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: The same thing is true of these notebooks so these workspaces allow you to organize all your work.

597
01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:56.790
MS Analytics Class 2021: And they can have your notebooks in your libraries and your notebooks are, if you did Jupiter notebooks and they called the Jupiter notebooks right so they're like Jupiter notebook so they have cells.

598
01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:04.470
MS Analytics Class 2021: And you can have markdown language, and you can have Python code, you have our code, you can have scala so scala is like a.

599
01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:17.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: it's like a Java like language but scala is the language that Apache spark is written on, so the Apache spark software runs in a language called scala so that's kind of like the native code that.

600
01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:28.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: That spark is written on, and so, when you're writing these notebooks and you're writing your code, you have the option to do scala our Python sequel or markdown so you can have.

601
01:19:29.190 --> 01:19:41.550
MS Analytics Class 2021: The cells be marked down so markdowns that html looking stuff right so technically everything you see right here in this little Jenner and gentle introduction, because this is a notebook, this is an A markdown so I here.

602
01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:48.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then I come down here, they have a few examples of code down here some of these are code cells right.

603
01:19:49.290 --> 01:19:49.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: and

604
01:19:50.790 --> 01:20:06.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so, in the end, these workspaces you have your notebooks you can have your libraries so, but the notebooks are scholar Python So when I get to home, like right here, and I want to create a new workspace I can go to home click on my username right here.

605
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:09.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: In the home sorry.

606
01:20:11.130 --> 01:20:17.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: And they just figured my user by user flies out over here, and then you know I can click this little arrow here.

607
01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:26.490
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then I can say, like new create a new notebook right, I can create a new folder if I wanted to put folder and.

608
01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:33.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: label this out ml flow experiment we'll talk about mo flow a little bit later I can export out, so I can have my notebooks.

609
01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:45.600
MS Analytics Class 2021: And if I want to like if I wrote a cool notebook I want to export out share it with you, I can export that out as html I can export that notebook out as what's called a BBC so data bricks.

610
01:20:46.320 --> 01:21:00.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: The sea is archive but file right, and I can import I can clone and I can create so if I say like create new notebook I can pick remember, I told you, they can be a Python scala sequel or are.

611
01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:16.620
MS Analytics Class 2021: So spark Apache spark supports what's called sparks equal, so you can actually write like sequel to the data that's in your Apache spark and it's just kind of like it's like an sql you'd write in our database like Oracle or sequel server.

612
01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:21.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: we're talking all Python today, so I, so I can just create a Python one.

613
01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:28.890
MS Analytics Class 2021: give it a name on this call it DEMO for Class i'm going to eat this anyway.

614
01:21:30.150 --> 01:21:31.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: And I say create right.

615
01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:48.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: So then have a cell now the differences between this and Jupiter notebooks this remember in Jupiter notebooks when you create a cell you could go and specify if it was a markdown sell or if it was a Python sell right or.

616
01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:51.180
MS Analytics Class 2021: But in.

617
01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:58.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: In data bricks will use what's called magic commands and that's right here that's what they're talking about right here.

618
01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:00.300
MS Analytics Class 2021: he's all percent.

619
01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.620
MS Analytics Class 2021: that's these magic commands if I want to do a markdown.

620
01:22:06.450 --> 01:22:07.290
MS Analytics Class 2021: I can do.

621
01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:19.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: reset md and then I click that becomes a markdown so.

622
01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:22.470
MS Analytics Class 2021: So i'll go back there and show you right.

623
01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:26.370
MS Analytics Class 2021: So now their cell becomes a markdown so.

624
01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:39.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: If I come over here and now the way to add more cells, when I highlight that cell I get this plus if I can add a cell below there or over here, if you look in the cells.

625
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:52.590
MS Analytics Class 2021: At this menu, so I can do things here, so I can click this drop down at a cell above or below I can copy sales cut cells export cells, so if I want to add another sale.

626
01:22:54.270 --> 01:23:00.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: And DEMO class and this this is going to be Python right it's I can say import ios I can do, Francis.

627
01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:06.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: version can't remember if it's a function with or if it's a.

628
01:23:09.090 --> 01:23:10.560
MS Analytics Class 2021: Variable I think it's a function.

629
01:23:16.290 --> 01:23:17.730
MS Analytics Class 2021: I always forget the exact syntax.

630
01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:22.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: What is oh that's good this one SEC, this is you got to do it.

631
01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:25.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: You do a.

632
01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.170
MS Analytics Class 2021: Python three x Brett.

633
01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:30.840
MS Analytics Class 2021: Sorry, I know.

634
01:23:32.190 --> 01:23:32.910
it's it says.

635
01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:43.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: I am I doing here oh wait hold on sorry guys I don't really tight the os version for Python.

636
01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:47.310
MS Analytics Class 2021: hold on one second now i'm just print.

637
01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:50.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: This sounds silly but I don't.

638
01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:52.830
MS Analytics Class 2021: I forget the the.

639
01:23:54.780 --> 01:24:03.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: that's the thing it's imports, this system version Okay, I was I had since right and I had this version right and I had it right, the first time I just.

640
01:24:04.230 --> 01:24:14.760
MS Analytics Class 2021: I if you notice I type system version, and I said I don't think it's a a function, I said I thought it was like this, but I just I did import os and not important SIS.

641
01:24:15.630 --> 01:24:22.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you see in this particular cells Python version is three dot seven right.

642
01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:29.280
MS Analytics Class 2021: Sorry, and you always when you go on the fly and your DEMO and like this, you always end up doing stupid stuff like that, but yeah so this.

643
01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:40.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: So this is just a Python so, but the point here is just to show you how I created a markdown so I created a Python Shell on that the reason that's important is because, as you use these know putting like code.

644
01:24:40.530 --> 01:24:50.310
MS Analytics Class 2021: You want to go and make your code have marked down so you know what's going on right so just, for example, these are these are out in your.

645
01:24:52.140 --> 01:25:01.830
MS Analytics Class 2021: And the download there's these files called BBC and so you can see some of these examples will walk we'll kind of walk through them, but you can see that these markdowns can be very.

646
01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:15.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: You know, complex, so that you can know what's going on and have images of stuff so let me go back to my little DEMO for Class so that makes sense right so.

647
01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:27.150
MS Analytics Class 2021: In our terminology of our workspaces and these workspaces have these notebooks and these notebooks are willing to write code for our database behind the scenes, when we run these notebooks.

648
01:25:28.770 --> 01:25:29.640
MS Analytics Class 2021: We have to.

649
01:25:31.050 --> 01:25:33.540
MS Analytics Class 2021: run them and and i'm gonna jump down a little bit.

650
01:25:34.740 --> 01:25:47.310
MS Analytics Class 2021: The clusters right, so a cluster is just a group of computers, you know that's running your code, and so the cool thing about data bricks is in the cloud is to create these clusters I just come to this cluster thing right here.

651
01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:52.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: And I can create a new cluster now already have to up there, let me zoom in.

652
01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:57.180
MS Analytics Class 2021: US i'm sorry I know i'm probably making i'll drop.

653
01:25:58.350 --> 01:26:07.050
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let me take a break with zooming in and out Okay, so I go to my clusters, right here, I do need zoom in So you can see, you see, I have to notice one is green.

654
01:26:08.490 --> 01:26:09.780
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it says running.

655
01:26:11.670 --> 01:26:21.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: And I have one that's black assist terminated, and the reason that's terminated because this is the Community edition of data works, and so, when I create my clusters it'll run.

656
01:26:22.050 --> 01:26:31.830
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then, if it's an active for two hours it's going to terminate it and go away, you won't be able to reuse this anymore it's gonna just it'll say terminated and then after a while it will just disappear from.

657
01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:39.150
MS Analytics Class 2021: Your Community edition, so I left us up to the show you because what's going to happen is when you start working with your projects.

658
01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:46.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: And you create your cluster you start working on your code and then it's not working right and he finally had enough like i'm gonna come back tomorrow.

659
01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:54.930
MS Analytics Class 2021: Here come back tomorrow and you slept on it, the receipt terminated on your on your code and it's my say hey I can't attach to the cluster to run my code.

660
01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:59.070
MS Analytics Class 2021: So those notebooks attached to these clusters, which is the computing.

661
01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:09.480
MS Analytics Class 2021: that's running my code right and so you're to go run your notebook and say hey I don't have a cluster and you go there you'll see we'll start button next to terminate here and click on it it's not going to start.

662
01:27:10.230 --> 01:27:19.890
MS Analytics Class 2021: So what you're going to need to do is and i'll do this now is i'm like delete these as i'm just coming here and click the little delete down here.

663
01:27:21.450 --> 01:27:23.400
MS Analytics Class 2021: I just click this little X right here.

664
01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:33.180
MS Analytics Class 2021: and delete it so i'm going to leak this cluster so I can show you what it looks like me create one right so also what I want to do is show you.

665
01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:36.660
MS Analytics Class 2021: So right now I deleted it.

666
01:27:38.010 --> 01:27:47.640
MS Analytics Class 2021: And now it's terminating as soon as terminated deleted, so I have no clusters So what does that mean if I go back to my home and I go to my DEMO for class.

667
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:50.400
MS Analytics Class 2021: And if you notice right up here.

668
01:27:52.170 --> 01:27:53.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: See, where it says detach.

669
01:27:54.930 --> 01:27:58.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: and your notebooks it's telling you what cluster this notebook is attached to so.

670
01:27:58.530 --> 01:28:08.280
MS Analytics Class 2021: When you get out and you're using the non Community edition of data bricks and you're using an actual paid version of data bricks you might have multiple clusters and your data bricks environment.

671
01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:22.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: may have one that's got gpus on it and it costs a lot of money to run your code on it, but your high end data scientist who's doing neural nets and stuff and once those gpus for performance is got access to that cluster and they're using it.

672
01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:31.350
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then you might have access to another cluster that doesn't have the gpus that has a little less power horsepower was a little cheaper and you're on that cluster so.

673
01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:41.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: In the paid version, you can have multiple clusters, so when you go and run your notebooks you can attach to different clusters opinion, what unique those clusters can have.

674
01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:49.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: A different setup like how many knows that can have Min and Max so they can scale out so you have to commend number of nodes to maximum or knows.

675
01:28:49.590 --> 01:29:01.830
MS Analytics Class 2021: You know what do they have gpus on in the notes mean they have you know graphics processing units for things like tensorflow or for other things that can take advantage of gpus for performance, you know.

676
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:12.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: And the bigger your nodes and the more features, the more cash right, so this is a pay per use so data bricks is a pay as you go product, and so, which means you start it up.

677
01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:20.160
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it doesn't really cost anything until you create clusters and then we start creating clusters and running code those clusters so.

678
01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:26.130
MS Analytics Class 2021: When you start a cluster and it's running you're paying whether codes running in or not you're paying for that cluster right so.

679
01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:36.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: An important thing to know, think about is when you get out and you're using this in the paid version you spin up a cluster when you set up those clusters and i'll do this now.

680
01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:42.120
MS Analytics Class 2021: So, actually, I want to try to run this code, so I go here and I try to run the cells over here and right here.

681
01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:45.810
Karen Fireman: jumping off the page Jim did you stop me.

682
01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:48.690
MS Analytics Class 2021: i'm sorry.

683
01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:53.520
MS Analytics Class 2021: and make this a little smaller I think that's the sizzle to lie.

684
01:29:54.570 --> 01:30:00.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: I make it a little smaller so in the cell if I want to run just the cell I go right here.

685
01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:03.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: And that's where this pluses right.

686
01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:07.500
MS Analytics Class 2021: And I can click run so.

687
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:19.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: right there on reason I apologize, I have to zoom in and out when I zoom in I can actually select so that's why I have to zoom in and out, so I can't stay zoomed in and select the button.

688
01:30:19.410 --> 01:30:23.400
MS Analytics Class 2021: The zoom and functionalities in doubt, meaning, maybe even stays in down I can't.

689
01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.020
MS Analytics Class 2021: i'm just afraid you will never see.

690
01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:27.540
MS Analytics Class 2021: Anything else we can see em you can see it.

691
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:36.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: doesn't say that okay and i'll just stay slim down let's give it up alright, so if I run the cell it's going to tell me hey the notebook cluster has been shut down.

692
01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:49.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: Would you like to launch a symbol, a cluster similar to jb J to to run and what this is going to do is it's going to automatically create your cluster for you and do it, but i'm going to cancel and just show you.

693
01:30:50.190 --> 01:30:55.830
MS Analytics Class 2021: What it looks like to create a cluster because when you do this on a paid version, for example.

694
01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:57.540
MS Analytics Class 2021: The.

695
01:30:58.890 --> 01:31:08.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: it's not going to do that that's a Community edition fight feature on the paid version wise right at these all show up y'all watch me delete these don't know okay yeah so.

696
01:31:10.170 --> 01:31:16.680
MS Analytics Class 2021: On the paid version here to come right here hit create cluster and you're given a name i'm just gonna call it a bj to plus.

697
01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:26.250
MS Analytics Class 2021: i'm going to pick the runtime version now in the paid version there's going to be like 1015 more boxes and menus and options.

698
01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:42.570
MS Analytics Class 2021: But for the free version, you can pick your runtime for what we're doing just take the default that shows up and notice right here free 15 gigs of memory, as a community edition user your cluster will automatically terminate after an idle period of two hours.

699
01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:51.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then down here, these availability zones don't worry just doesn't matter if this leave the default right, and this is just going to create me a cluster so.

700
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:58.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: When you go and look at the paid version there's really a lot several more few few more options than this right.

701
01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:06.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: So, and then the other thing is down here in this little menu right here under spark there's some different commands you can do, but you don't need to do anything about that right now.

702
01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:15.480
MS Analytics Class 2021: In general somebody's gonna probably set this up for you the cluster you're going to go in the home and create a notebook so i'm.

703
01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:23.490
MS Analytics Class 2021: I just hit create cluster and pretty much all you guys have to do and gals is just give it a name to create cluster just take the default.

704
01:32:23.850 --> 01:32:33.390
MS Analytics Class 2021: Given a name take the faults that create cluster and then it's going to spin up and you see the little green box of spinning around right here that's let me know that it's spinning up my cluster form.

705
01:32:34.710 --> 01:32:49.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: And once I have my cluster, then I can go back and run my clothes code, I can attach my notebook to my cluster to run my code, so the notebook has my data that's persistent that stays there, so when your cluster it like when you log out of this and you go sleep tonight.

706
01:32:51.540 --> 01:33:01.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: or I go to sleep tonight and I come back tomorrow morning in this Community edition that clusters gonna say terminated my you will be deleted and but my notebooks and all that stuff will still be there.

707
01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:04.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: So.

708
01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:07.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: We have no it doesn't, let us.

709
01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:13.740
Karen Fireman: It doesn't, let us create a cluster once we had the workspace done because the workspace created a cluster and it says, we have a limit of one.

710
01:33:14.670 --> 01:33:21.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: yeah you only have a limit to what, if you if you create if you ran your code and you let it automatically create clusters like I do you don't have to worry about it doesn't.

711
01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:31.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: The name doesn't matter the whatever it is doesn't matter as long as you have a cluster that's active that's all you need and then your notebook will you attach it to an active cluster.

712
01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:34.620
MS Analytics Class 2021: And you're good you just need a cluster that's got a green dot like this one.

713
01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:44.130
MS Analytics Class 2021: Because really the Community edition there's there's not really any settings other than you need one you only can have one cluster and the Community edition, and it needs to be running if you want to run code.

714
01:33:44.970 --> 01:33:59.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: So, now that I have my cluster running i'm going to go over here back to my little DEMO for class and you see right here, it says detach and i'm going to hit up here at the top there's a little little run all sells a notebook i'm I click that.

715
01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:04.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it's gonna say hey cluster blah blah does not exist, we will page.

716
01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:20.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then you come right here and I need to drop this little arrow down and attach it to my cluster so before you can run a notebook you got to attach it to the cluster I noticed when I attach it to the cluster all the syntax highlighting came on.

717
01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:29.130
MS Analytics Class 2021: So what we've done so far we've created a Python notebook we created a compute cluster.

718
01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:39.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: With node so that we can run our code we've attached our notebook that's got our Python code to this cluster and let's just run all the cells and make sure they're all working.

719
01:34:40.830 --> 01:34:43.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: And Sure enough, it is so.

720
01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:52.890
MS Analytics Class 2021: i'm going to import another package i'm going to import we're gonna talk about this package later don't worry about what it is now i'm going to import koalas.

721
01:34:54.630 --> 01:34:58.290
MS Analytics Class 2021: there's a package called koalas and i'm going to run this cell.

722
01:35:00.630 --> 01:35:07.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: notice when I hit run here and the arrow I can want to all above so you have the ability to remember in the visual studio code.

723
01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:14.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: When I showed you if you had your cursor here there's options to say hey run this and interactive window up to this line or run from this line down.

724
01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:24.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: same thing here, so if you if you made some changes and you want to run all your code up to the cell you still have those one all above and below so i'm just gonna run this one self that's all I have.

725
01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:38.520
MS Analytics Class 2021: i'm going to run it, and this will give me an error and that area is no module name for all US i'm a copy that because i'm lazy and I want to type that is because that's a package that's not automatically installed by default.

726
01:35:39.570 --> 01:35:42.120
MS Analytics Class 2021: In this Apaches in this data bricks.

727
01:35:43.230 --> 01:35:44.550
MS Analytics Class 2021: Like pandas, for example.

728
01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:50.040
MS Analytics Class 2021: Remember, whenever you were running your code for like.

729
01:35:52.050 --> 01:35:56.280
MS Analytics Class 2021: Dr Jones or for me, you had to install pandas right.

730
01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:08.040
MS Analytics Class 2021: I didn't get an error for pandas so one thing to note about these data bricks environments, a lot of the some of the packages are already installed, a lot of the like pandas seaborne map live.

731
01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:15.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: So I can learn a lot of those packages are already in the cluster for you i'm sure there's a list somewhere, you find out but.

732
01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:26.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: If you do an import and it gives you an error saying it's not installed, that means you have to install that package So how do you do that you do that on the cluster So if I go back to the cluster.

733
01:36:27.210 --> 01:36:33.300
MS Analytics Class 2021: And if I highlight over the cluster and see right here, where it says libraries, or I can just select the cluster.

734
01:36:34.290 --> 01:36:38.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: And up here, I see where i'm at right with me libraries I click libraries.

735
01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:46.890
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it says no new libraries, no library, now that doesn't mean there's no libraries your clusters I just means there's no libraries that you've installed on that cluster.

736
01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:53.130
MS Analytics Class 2021: there's libraries there because there there's a built in ones that come with Python and like I said I showed you how to import pandas.

737
01:36:53.670 --> 01:37:04.500
MS Analytics Class 2021: And that's not something that's by default in your installation Python that's by default, because there are a list of default packages being getting set up in a in a data bricks Apache spark environment for you.

738
01:37:05.790 --> 01:37:13.620
MS Analytics Class 2021: to pull an environment like fall into this I don't think he's pulling him off file, so this is not like a Honda environment.

739
01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:24.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: Right, so this so this so that's a good question right, and what that and so his question was for those of how I could hear it is like, is there a way to pull like an environment and install certain.

740
01:37:25.290 --> 01:37:34.530
MS Analytics Class 2021: packages like a gamble file and I don't know if there's a way to do it the animal file, you can do like maven packages or jar files that might have stuff code in there.

741
01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:40.590
MS Analytics Class 2021: But it's not like you're not creating con environments here you each one of these clusters runs one version of Python.

742
01:37:41.190 --> 01:37:53.640
MS Analytics Class 2021: Right across all the nodes so it's consistent, so you don't you're not in these nodes you're not like how your on your laptop there can set up multiple cloud environments, you have whatever version and where did that version come from we created the cluster we told him.

743
01:37:54.990 --> 01:38:04.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: We clicked right there and we said we wanted data bricks runtime seven five or data bricks one time seven six that has scala 2.1 to spark 3.1.

744
01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:16.860
MS Analytics Class 2021: And those have the set versions of Java Python and set versions of scala set vs spark, and the reason is is because they need all this, they need all of this to work in conjunction so.

745
01:38:17.250 --> 01:38:23.850
MS Analytics Class 2021: So that's that's why, when you notice you prayed a notebook and you said Python Python and say like 363738.

746
01:38:24.330 --> 01:38:34.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: So these data bricks on times have this that they have a certain version of Python they're running a certain version scala number patchy spark scala so that earlier.

747
01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:48.600
MS Analytics Class 2021: And the version of spark and these cases were at spark for you, oh three x something that's the latest version of spark is the free version, so that came from there right so that came from any place your cluster so i'm I go back here go back to libraries.

748
01:38:50.490 --> 01:38:53.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: I noticed one thing, before going to live on Jupiter notebooks real quick.

749
01:38:54.330 --> 01:38:56.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is showing me that I have a notebook attached.

750
01:38:58.350 --> 01:39:04.500
MS Analytics Class 2021: To this cluster so I can detach if I wanted to write so it's just showing you hey here's this notebook here's where it's located.

751
01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:10.680
MS Analytics Class 2021: it's idols not doing anything, right now, so this is just a way like if you're in ministry in the data bricks cluster as a data.

752
01:39:11.130 --> 01:39:15.120
MS Analytics Class 2021: Data bricks administrator you know, in the cluster they have tools here for you to see.

753
01:39:15.510 --> 01:39:26.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: hey who's all attached to my cluster what's going on that's what that's showing you but right now we want to get koalas install so how we do that, so we go to libraries koalas is a Python library, so we say install new.

754
01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:28.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: And we want to go pi pi.

755
01:39:29.850 --> 01:39:33.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: So there's no contest like they don't use kinda and the.

756
01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:40.110
MS Analytics Class 2021: The data bricks and environment they use you straight Python and so you're going to use pi pi, which is the pip install.

757
01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:46.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: The good thing is, you have to type the command pip install you can just type what package you want install and notice.

758
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:53.250
MS Analytics Class 2021: right here like they they have an example simple json, but you can do just like what you did when you did the animal file.

759
01:39:53.850 --> 01:40:02.880
MS Analytics Class 2021: or like when we did the requirements file for the con for the kinda kinda for the docker install you can specify the version of package so if you needed a particular.

760
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:12.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: version of the package you can specify that on the line there as well, but we don't need that in this case we just we just want to start quality, so I typed in koalas and I hit install.

761
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:21.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it's going to go and install the koalas Python package for me we'll talk about what quality is in a second.

762
01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:31.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: But now you see where it says installed now here's the thing to note that's installed in that cluster tomorrow morning I wake up in this cluster is terminated.

763
01:40:31.950 --> 01:40:41.940
MS Analytics Class 2021: package is not installed in my new cluster I set it up, so you have to re install that package right so just know this is the Community version, the paid version, the clusters don't terminate and disappear on.

764
01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:53.340
MS Analytics Class 2021: The only terminate disappear if you terminate and disappear them yourself right so on the paid version your clusters will shut down, and you can set it up there's we don't have that option when we create the clusters here.

765
01:40:53.820 --> 01:41:03.540
MS Analytics Class 2021: On the Community edition, but in the paid version, when you create your clusters there's a little checkbox you can say hey auto terminate the cluster after X minutes of idle time and you put with the minute car.

766
01:41:04.110 --> 01:41:07.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: highly recommend you do that if you're paying for this, because these things can be expensive.

767
01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:16.590
MS Analytics Class 2021: Depending on how much you scale out your clusters other things you didn't see when we create this cluster they give me options for how many knows, like the men nodes and the MAC notes.

768
01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:31.050
MS Analytics Class 2021: The paid version will give you those type of options right so So if you need like 1000 knows the process something, because you have 60 petabytes of data, you can do that note that it probably be several million dollars, she has I don't want the Max node limit is but.

769
01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:40.320
MS Analytics Class 2021: But you can specify that in the paid version, but when you install your packages in the paid version and your clusters, they get installed or clusters not predate a brick.

770
01:41:40.860 --> 01:41:47.700
MS Analytics Class 2021: Like my goodness, I did this install that was installed in that cluster that package, if I was in the paid version, where I can have multiple clusters.

771
01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:53.400
MS Analytics Class 2021: And I needed that package for all my clusters and have to go to each individual cluster install that package that makes sense.

772
01:41:54.180 --> 01:42:04.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: The main thing I want you all to know is, when you're playing with this later on, and you install a package and you go to bed at night, you come back up and get the recreate your cluster remember if you had any packages that were using.

773
01:42:05.070 --> 01:42:10.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: That you were using you'll have to remember to reinstall them into your new cluster because this is the free Community version.

774
01:42:12.030 --> 01:42:15.120
MS Analytics Class 2021: So that's how we install packages and database.

775
01:42:16.410 --> 01:42:24.660
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so, this is the cluster So if I go back to my DEMO for Class now that we install wallace no salt says it's red.

776
01:42:25.410 --> 01:42:41.310
MS Analytics Class 2021: That doesn't mean that that's bad code that's just saying, the last time I ran it I had an error notice down here I want you to notice and things on here, it might be the smallest grade right here, but it told me, you know who ran it by user ran it what time.

777
01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:53.130
MS Analytics Class 2021: So this is just saying at three you know march forth at 749 and I try to run this I got this know module found air right so let's try to run it now.

778
01:42:54.690 --> 01:42:56.520
MS Analytics Class 2021: We also be good oh crap.

779
01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:03.540
MS Analytics Class 2021: Man i'm not good at demos, they might know this is, this is what I expected I promise you so when I saw the package.

780
01:43:05.310 --> 01:43:13.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: I don't know why they have a bug that shouldn't keep showing us so one sorry there's a bug in their thing you know this this.

781
01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:16.110
MS Analytics Class 2021: rid of my cluster you.

782
01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:24.150
MS Analytics Class 2021: There, yes, for some reason, like there's some bug in there, and this chrome or this version might be this version of chrome is not up to date.

783
01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:38.910
MS Analytics Class 2021: Because I go back you know, so it should my old clusters, but the problem is once you install the package, you have to restart the cluster so anytime you install a new package into a cluster you'll have to restart so so.

784
01:43:39.930 --> 01:43:40.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: Just remember that.

785
01:43:41.730 --> 01:43:44.100
Karen Fireman: What do you mean restart it, what did you do to restart it.

786
01:43:44.490 --> 01:43:46.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: I hit this button right here called restart.

787
01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:47.760
MS Analytics Class 2021: we're there.

788
01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:55.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: So so that's so I just paint here back to my cluster and I hit restart I wanted to show you that on purpose, because.

789
01:43:55.890 --> 01:43:59.880
MS Analytics Class 2021: We were last year when they were doing this students are like hey install the package, it didn't work.

790
01:44:00.690 --> 01:44:06.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: And I was like Okay, did you restart the cluster, and so this is a point out some things I want you to remember so.

791
01:44:07.650 --> 01:44:10.860
MS Analytics Class 2021: Those of you at home watching like call me cat on TV right now listen.

792
01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:17.970
MS Analytics Class 2021: If your things are made important because they'll leave your project your cluster will disappear after two hours of inactivity you want to delete and create a new one.

793
01:44:18.450 --> 01:44:26.700
MS Analytics Class 2021: Your packages that you installed in your cluster will disappear when your cluster disappears, so you need to re install your packages into your cluster when you recreate it again.

794
01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:37.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: And the third thing is when you install the package or packages, you have to restart your cluster so that those packages are loaded because for performance reasons these.

795
01:44:37.650 --> 01:44:48.300
MS Analytics Class 2021: clusters when they start up a start up they load all the environments, they set it all up right, and so a lot of times also when these clusters they're not just sitting there idle so when these clusters get shut down.

796
01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:56.040
MS Analytics Class 2021: they're not like you're you're in the data Center it's not like oh wait here's the jv J two plus.

797
01:44:56.670 --> 01:45:06.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: hardware over here waiting to be restarted again no it's it's gone when I go to restart this again in the cloud the cloud defined some free resources available starts my cluster up on those right.

798
01:45:07.260 --> 01:45:15.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: that's the beauty of the cloud, they can manage all that for us right so now that I restarted my cluster I go back to my DEMO for class.

799
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:17.520
MS Analytics Class 2021: You rerun the cell.

800
01:45:19.530 --> 01:45:20.970
MS Analytics Class 2021: And we have pretty little calls.

801
01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:23.940
MS Analytics Class 2021: Everybody with me no.

802
01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:25.710
Karen Fireman: No.

803
01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:27.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: yeah, why are we not have.

804
01:45:27.690 --> 01:45:28.920
MS Analytics Class 2021: yeah hold on one second.

805
01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:44.730
MS Analytics Class 2021: That is that I missed calls now, so I cut and pasted it, why is it not I just did this at home Oh, I actually just did this there i'll go to let's go back to my cluster and make sure that.

806
01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:56.010
MS Analytics Class 2021: I was still restarting sorry this is this browser is jacked up I don't know it's gone so let's go back to our libraries quality is there that's installed.

807
01:45:57.750 --> 01:46:01.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: So why is it telling me it's not.

808
01:46:07.710 --> 01:46:12.930
MS Analytics Class 2021: Just make sure I didn't miss type back, but no I couldn't pasted it right, I did so why is.

809
01:46:18.810 --> 01:46:20.190
It is it working.

810
01:46:24.030 --> 01:46:34.620
MS Analytics Class 2021: I promise you I demoed all this on my laptop by second like right by our listening to Dr Sarah was rewriting all my demos again, let me try this.

811
01:46:37.890 --> 01:46:40.290
MS Analytics Class 2021: One more time yeah Mike yeah.

812
01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: i'm gonna go, so I just went to a different one started it so.

813
01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:51.840
MS Analytics Class 2021: they're having some issues.

814
01:46:54.780 --> 01:47:02.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: So it's trying this so see I must have missed type quality or something cuz or hasn't got the quality down here, no.

815
01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:06.390
MS Analytics Class 2021: Oh i'm sorry my bad.

816
01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:08.190
I take that back I did.

817
01:47:09.570 --> 01:47:11.700
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yes, I did I did.

818
01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:24.690
MS Analytics Class 2021: Your I retired this I just might just now right and I did this two seconds ago I keep forgetting its data bricks koalas why because data bricks wrote the Koala package, and they want you to know that this.

819
01:47:25.980 --> 01:47:31.500
MS Analytics Class 2021: don't know why they make you do data bricks wallace because you know, like you, don't do import whatever not pandas.

820
01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:36.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: But, for whatever reason, data bricks I guess wants you to know that koalas is written by data bricks.

821
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:44.490
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so I promise you I demoed this code earlier, but now it's Okay, and I did the same error, this afternoon, when I was playing with this, I.

822
01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:55.320
MS Analytics Class 2021: always forget that it's data bricks color because most people don't make you put their company name.in front of their package, but data bricks wants you to know that they created this package for you.

823
01:47:56.220 --> 01:48:02.730
MS Analytics Class 2021: will come back to what qualities but so we understand notebooks understand the clusters understand how to attach how to install.

824
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:09.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: The Python libraries in our cluster into our clusters, how to restart them when the packages aren't there.

825
01:48:09.630 --> 01:48:17.520
MS Analytics Class 2021: And I promise I didn't type data bricks wallace and I got the error that first time I would have gotten the air as well if I didn't restart my cluster I still got that same error.

826
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:34.680
MS Analytics Class 2021: I didn't do that on purpose I just forgot the pipe data bricks wallace so and then coming back over here you have tables so order table, so if I go to my data here, I can have tables in here, and so I can come in here and.

827
01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:46.050
MS Analytics Class 2021: do create tables, so I don't generally create my tables this way like I don't go to my data bricks click the data button click create tables i'm usually writing code during my data and.

828
01:48:46.380 --> 01:48:58.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: But because we're in class and Community edition i'm going to show you how to import your csv file in, and this is what I recommend you do for the class right now, but like out at my company, I have a data lake.

829
01:48:58.860 --> 01:49:06.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: And my cloud or I dumped my files into it and then my data bricks environment knows how to connect to that data lake to read the files in that data.

830
01:49:06.690 --> 01:49:22.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: So i'm not having to go in here and do great new table, but for what you're doing and learning data bricks, this is a great way to learn it right, you can create this table it's going to put a it's going to load the file up into the cluster operating system for you to use and.

831
01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:40.020
MS Analytics Class 2021: And play with your code so so i'm just going to upload a file so up here, you get some other options just ignore that for now s3 is amazon's blob storage to collect their data like but i'm just gonna say upload a file i'm going to select my file.

832
01:49:41.970 --> 01:49:46.350
MS Analytics Class 2021: And right now my cluster already has this file in there, but hold on one second.

833
01:49:48.510 --> 01:49:59.520
MS Analytics Class 2021: i'm going to browse right here sorry I put I do this every time I want to say select select the saying hey if I want to select the file it's already on what's called my data bricks file system, meaning the file system that's in my cluster.

834
01:50:00.870 --> 01:50:07.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: But in this case, I want to upload a file from my homework folder so i've exported, I mean i've.

835
01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:11.340
MS Analytics Class 2021: downloaded into the desktop.

836
01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:17.790
MS Analytics Class 2021: Your content here, I have my red wine quality father, so I just browse it I selected it.

837
01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:21.990
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then some things to note notice this right here.

838
01:50:23.130 --> 01:50:38.520
MS Analytics Class 2021: You want to remember this file store tables wine color red csv these are going to be a location of your file now I can come right here and say create table with you, I So if I do that it's going to tell me select the cluster.

839
01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:42.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: To put my table I can click preview table.

840
01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:46.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: it's going to go and read my data.

841
01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:56.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: To try um I click first row has headers.

842
01:50:56.250 --> 01:50:58.230
Karen Fireman: Because, in my case, the header.

843
01:50:59.130 --> 01:51:05.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: And if I remember right the deliberate or semi colons i'm a type semi colon here I don't know why this is taking so long, there we go.

844
01:51:07.740 --> 01:51:11.040
MS Analytics Class 2021: So, then, I can say, create table so.

845
01:51:14.550 --> 01:51:27.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: and see right here this table name there's a little field it's a table name so creative me a table name called one call you read csv and then it shows me the schema and the data right So if I come back to data, I can see this.

846
01:51:29.700 --> 01:51:32.700
MS Analytics Class 2021: red wine quality read csv table.

847
01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:42.480
MS Analytics Class 2021: that's in here now what was important, is whenever I go back here i'll do the CRATE table again, it was important to remember is when I browse and I select that.

848
01:51:43.950 --> 01:51:44.550
MS Analytics Class 2021: file.

849
01:51:49.530 --> 01:51:53.490
MS Analytics Class 2021: And i'm slowly slow, is to remember this part right here.

850
01:51:54.750 --> 01:52:02.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: right as follow up with because we're going to use that in the code so i'm I can't i'm gonna cancel this, for now, and this is DEMO this is in the.

851
01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:07.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: If you forget this, if I go back to the project.

852
01:52:09.330 --> 01:52:10.470
MS Analytics Class 2021: One thing.

853
01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:26.880
MS Analytics Class 2021: I show you how to create clusters I show you how to import and we're going to do this in a second the CDC file I show you how to import the notebook to the sample so you can run it I show you how to upload the file.

854
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:38.040
MS Analytics Class 2021: I tell you remember this path, right here, I put little arrows for you, so all right, so if you're if you forget it, I just said.

855
01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:43.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: it's in the project file, I give you, step by step instructions, how to run your project so.

856
01:52:43.980 --> 01:52:49.380
Karen Fireman: You made a second choice there when you did the table one was blue on the left and then there was a second choice.

857
01:52:49.410 --> 01:52:55.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: yeah the second choices we would have created a notebook with commands in it that would look something like this.

858
01:52:57.660 --> 01:53:12.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so they said hey here's my file location here's the tight here's some stuff and do that so i'll give you that real quick that's that's I was going to do that, next anyway, so that was the next step, so I will come back here sure another way so.

859
01:53:12.060 --> 01:53:13.560
Stephanie Pollock: In your in your.

860
01:53:14.580 --> 01:53:25.260
Stephanie Pollock: project, it says, specifically not to use the data set that we used for the assignments one and two, but for the project you actually do want us.

861
01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:28.590
Stephanie Pollock: Or do you want us to use red one.

862
01:53:29.190 --> 01:53:29.910
MS Analytics Class 2021: So really good.

863
01:53:30.930 --> 01:53:39.300
Stephanie Pollock: In the file the project file, it says and to specifically not use the data set that we use for assignment one.

864
01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:41.910
Stephanie Pollock: It says, use the red one quality.

865
01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:46.350
MS Analytics Class 2021: Oh yeah I think you're right i'm Sorry, I think I I mean, let me Let me read it again.

866
01:53:47.340 --> 01:53:48.180
Stephanie Pollock: number five.

867
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:53.310
MS Analytics Class 2021: Five yeah oh yeah you're right you're right I didn't I wanted to make it easy for you guys.

868
01:53:53.700 --> 01:54:05.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: The whole point of this is, I wanted to make sure you how to set up data bricks you how to import data and use it, you have to import a notebook and use it, you had a run and so i'm not so concerned about you, having to make it your own.

869
01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:14.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: What I want to do is to make sure that you were able to get it all working, and this is going to be really easy, so you know you're going to bring it in.

870
01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:31.500
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so yeah thanks for clarifying I probably I totally forgot that that that's what I did right so users as on Nice not true i'm sorry right here and Edit new notebook to use your data set from assignment one no that's right no.

871
01:54:32.220 --> 01:54:34.410
Stephanie Pollock: Replacing with red wine data.

872
01:54:35.310 --> 01:54:41.010
MS Analytics Class 2021: yeah that's what I mean by that that's just bad grammar by dude from Louisiana but I mean by that is.

873
01:54:41.700 --> 01:54:50.550
MS Analytics Class 2021: you're going to import my notebook I take that back I do want you to use your own data I didn't I was confused, as you can tell, I confuse myself for saying I do still want you to use your own data.

874
01:54:51.570 --> 01:54:58.860
MS Analytics Class 2021: What i'm saying is is when you do this when I when I have you do this you're going to you're going to import with your data, not the red wine.

875
01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:06.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: That makes sense, so what I mean by this is when you when you import this file.

876
01:55:07.050 --> 01:55:13.890
MS Analytics Class 2021: And edit and Edit the new notebook to use your data set resign one you know you want to replace and use your data so that.

877
01:55:14.550 --> 01:55:19.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: But i'm only demoing red wine because that's what I have the template right, so what I would suggest is.

878
01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:28.920
MS Analytics Class 2021: Follow the steps just import the red wine, make sure it works and then go you'll import the notebook machete that second you'll import the notebook given a name to match your data set.

879
01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:43.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: Important in connected to the red wine, make sure it works and then use the use this get data to bring your file and save your path and then you're gonna plug your your data into the red wine, just like you did for one and two homework.

880
01:55:43.770 --> 01:55:51.390
MS Analytics Class 2021: i'm sorry I thanks for clarifying that carries I realized that's a little confusing what I meant by is when you're doing the homework.

881
01:55:52.020 --> 01:56:00.600
MS Analytics Class 2021: My example show red wine, but I mean is, replace the important the data with your data set replacing red wine data with your data set does that make sense.

882
01:56:01.170 --> 01:56:07.290
Karen Fireman: except one thing I think amy um it does, but I thought, our data sets for the dad.

883
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:12.570
Karen Fireman: Did I forget where our data sets are or it's just any data set.

884
01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:14.730
MS Analytics Class 2021: Is the data set to use for homework one and two.

885
01:56:16.530 --> 01:56:22.110
MS Analytics Class 2021: So I basically, I want you to have to go find new ones so whatever data set us for homework wanting to.

886
01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:24.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: I gotcha gotcha for this yes.

887
01:56:24.540 --> 01:56:30.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: Yes, i'm sorry curious I apologize I I did I was like I didn't think I had to do this red wine, I want to do at least still be user data.

888
01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:35.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: So sorry sorry it's a little confusing my wording.

889
01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:42.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: English is my second language after New Orleans so.

890
01:56:43.980 --> 01:56:44.130
MS Analytics Class 2021: But.

891
01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:56.040
MS Analytics Class 2021: That makes sense i'm sorry I confuse myself when you get up here talking, you know you can easily forget what you're talking about sometimes so So the idea here is you're gonna take my red wine.

892
01:56:57.150 --> 01:57:04.530
MS Analytics Class 2021: dpc file sharing for a second and make it your own with your data set don't worry about trying to do fancy models during like that just.

893
01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:11.550
MS Analytics Class 2021: Put your data file in there, if your data files excel and you read you read itself save it out to a csv and.

894
01:57:11.910 --> 01:57:18.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: bring it in you're not having you don't care about using your pickle file here and build a new model so if you had 60,000 columns and you.

895
01:57:18.750 --> 01:57:28.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: don't you don't need 60,000 columns pick two x's and ally and be done with it, I just want you know, make it easy on yourself makes you just get data bricks working with your data set.

896
01:57:29.670 --> 01:57:37.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: So I mean this class is not about building valid models this class is about learning the technology so that you can deploy your models.

897
01:57:38.670 --> 01:57:48.150
MS Analytics Class 2021: So that makes sense right good so thanks Chris good question I see how I wrote that might even feel myself again when I read it, I was like no.

898
01:57:48.990 --> 01:57:59.940
MS Analytics Class 2021: So so back to here so somebody asked what happens when I do right here, so I did this browse a grab one one quality that instead of the blue, what if I say create table a new book new book.

899
01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:09.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: It gives me this right, you might do this, the reason why is because now, I have this notebook and if you forgot to write that path down guess what it's right here.

900
01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:18.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: And what that path is is where that csv file you uploaded was stored in the file system and your cluster.

901
01:58:19.650 --> 01:58:33.300
MS Analytics Class 2021: Right, so when you did this great table you him, you gave it a file it dropped it to a file system and then, in this case when it says, create a notebook it gives you a few commands so i'm attach this to my cluster and i'll run this and let's see what happens.

902
01:58:36.930 --> 01:58:51.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so it says hey here's my file location that type of si SV it's got the Dillon winner of comma, it might be calm actually in the snow, these are semi colon I think actually so see right here notice something notice right here, where it only showed one.

903
01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:55.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: Right unless there's like gives me one column.

904
01:58:57.540 --> 01:59:03.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: It didn't refer the right the limiter and we're this round my one quality that has a.

905
01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:13.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: A semi colon So if I change this to a silly calling now I get right but oh that's not the right headers.

906
01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:18.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: I need to change that the true.

907
01:59:20.100 --> 01:59:28.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: So play with this, you know import file running notebook like that, so what this is doing right now, here is this is setting some variables up.

908
01:59:29.070 --> 01:59:46.860
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it's using spark reformat so what this is from from the pie spark package and it's creating what's called a spark data frame So if I, if I have a slide on this in a second i'm gonna go to the slides in about two minutes here a second So if I press tight def.

909
01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:48.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: Or we run this again.

910
01:59:52.440 --> 02:00:00.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: You can see down here, this is a pi spark sequel data frame what's the other data frame you've learned in in this in this in this.

911
02:00:01.530 --> 02:00:02.640
MS Analytics Class 2021: In this program.

912
02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:05.100
MS Analytics Class 2021: pandas pandas right.

913
02:00:05.490 --> 02:00:06.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: So now, you know second time.

914
02:00:07.140 --> 02:00:17.040
MS Analytics Class 2021: So these are specialized data frames, that the patchy spark the data breaks can use to be able to parallel eyes out your code and run faster so.

915
02:00:17.880 --> 02:00:29.760
MS Analytics Class 2021: You can't take like SP learn, so I could learn those standard Panda library standards use me Python libraries that work on Panda data frames are known pie you can't take those and run them against the spark.

916
02:00:30.870 --> 02:00:35.940
MS Analytics Class 2021: The pie spark sequel data frame that's a special type of data frame and that's require.

917
02:00:36.270 --> 02:00:44.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: A code and packages from and since we're using Python here from pi spark to use the spark data frames i'm a DEMO this in a minute.

918
02:00:44.970 --> 02:00:53.760
Karen Fireman: He can I ask you, questions Karen or do do all these things disappear that we just did that you just did if you're on the Community even.

919
02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:56.370
MS Analytics Class 2021: Though you're gonna disappear, the cluster.

920
02:00:56.910 --> 02:00:59.490
MS Analytics Class 2021: The cluster goes away, but all this code sits there.

921
02:01:01.710 --> 02:01:09.180
Karen Fireman: So the data, so the part, so if we went into data later after we are cluster went down able to see this stuff.

922
02:01:09.510 --> 02:01:09.960
Karen Fireman: Yes.

923
02:01:10.470 --> 02:01:20.970
MS Analytics Class 2021: yeah the data will still be there, so that does keep a it does shut down the resources, but the data is there and I can confirm that, because I haven't used this Community edition until this morning.

924
02:01:21.450 --> 02:01:34.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: actually did it last week, too, so I was checking things out but I haven't used it since last semester, and this code like right here that i'm demoing So when I went right here, and so, if I go in here and I go to read one quality.

925
02:01:37.890 --> 02:01:41.100
MS Analytics Class 2021: And if you look, you can see where I ran this today at 124.

926
02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:59.760
MS Analytics Class 2021: I didn't re upload that file, it was there, so it the file stay there, but won't stay there are the packages and the cluster computing nodes itself, but they will they do give you a little story i'll keep, though, when a request those clusters that knows how to recreate those files.

927
02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:03.780
Karen Fireman: Thank you.

928
02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:05.940
Charles Swanson: Get Jamie Mr Charles.

929
02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:12.330
Charles Swanson: clarification, are we going to be using your model but we're just attach our data.

930
02:02:13.050 --> 02:02:27.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you're gonna take like i'm already here, right here so you're gonna take this and you're gonna replace with number that that file so like when you upload your file your place with the path to your file here come down here and you're going to replace the.

931
02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:38.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: word for that so see right here, I say data equals the F to Panda some so i'm reading this in right here as a spark data frame.

932
02:02:38.730 --> 02:02:43.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: we're actually going to process it as a spark data frame we're going to read it, and as a spark data frame but we're going to use.

933
02:02:44.190 --> 02:03:00.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: This to pandas function to convert our spark data frame back to a pandas I wouldn't normally do this when I want to be able to use this stuff at scale, but just for simplicity sake for just showing you guys how to use data, where it's like the main thing I want you to get out of this.

934
02:03:01.050 --> 02:03:12.270
MS Analytics Class 2021: is how to create the clusters important notebooks and and use data bricks and this case we're going to import our data as a spark beta frame that second type of data frame but.

935
02:03:12.570 --> 02:03:24.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: that's what I was just talking about these SK learns these are just standard Python packages they can't work against a spark data frame they only can work against a pandas data frame and to do that, I have this little.

936
02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:27.390
MS Analytics Class 2021: function called to pandas.

937
02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:36.270
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it is a built in function actually comes out of pocket now What it does is to a packet of product called Apache arrow.

938
02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:52.590
MS Analytics Class 2021: Which is a guy that invented pandas and then the our guy the brain just went black hills in Houston actually I think still is in Houston heroes deep flyer and you know all the all the our packages, if you know our name my brain just went blank.

939
02:03:52.860 --> 02:03:55.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: it's a collaboration them to to kind of like take.

940
02:03:55.650 --> 02:04:07.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: And kind of seamlessly make data frames and different things work and operate kind of the same between all the different environments, but this aero package this arrow thing will take the convert this data frame using two panels to a panel data frame.

941
02:04:08.850 --> 02:04:10.890
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so, then you'll just come down here and you'll split your data.

942
02:04:10.890 --> 02:04:11.700
MS Analytics Class 2021: up right.

943
02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:13.530
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you have your chain and test split.

944
02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:27.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then you'll come down here here here is i'm using some Panda functions right so i'm dropping quality out of X so i'm using this drop function to drop quality out of my training xml test specs.

945
02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:41.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then i'm using training quality and train so i'm just using these things from grabbing the quality that's what I was predicting my red wine to create my wife that makes sense, so, whereas I did it and homework one and two, I was using non pi.

946
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:42.780
MS Analytics Class 2021: itself it's just.

947
02:04:42.990 --> 02:04:48.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: I had my excess 03 11, then I had my Why is 11 so I just use those you know the.

948
02:04:49.740 --> 02:04:57.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: Rules the end that's a split it up and in this DEMO i'm using pandas and so i'm using taking advantage of have to have the column names to.

949
02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:09.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: To use this drop function and pandas to drop the quality and then i'm using just the double bracket you know what column name to grab those are the y, which in this case is quality makes sense.

950
02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:19.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so, this is all yours so and then just do a simple elastic net we're gonna fit it put on our square that's it it shouldn't take you.

951
02:05:19.860 --> 02:05:21.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: Hopefully, but an hour to do.

952
02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:23.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: But she says, I can.

953
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:24.570
MS Analytics Class 2021: I give you a we.

954
02:05:25.620 --> 02:05:29.550
Karen Fireman: are using your red wine quality and putting our data into.

955
02:05:29.550 --> 02:05:36.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: yeah using this as a tempest exact same thing you did for wanting to use this as a template i'm gonna show you how to get this template into your environment in a second.

956
02:05:37.410 --> 02:05:45.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: Next, and you'll import this in as your template and then what you'll do is you'll do the thing right, where I just went since, in the send the file.

957
02:05:46.380 --> 02:05:59.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: And the project you'll go through, where I went to data first and you'll do create table and bringing your csv file right and then you're going to come to home and you're going to say here you're gonna say important.

958
02:06:00.900 --> 02:06:14.940
MS Analytics Class 2021: And this is documented in the file and you're going to go here and look for what red wine quality BBC, not the quality wine red wine quality BBC or a small either ones, the same it actually can do both but pick the BBC and hit open.

959
02:06:16.350 --> 02:06:18.450
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then i'm gonna say important now.

960
02:06:19.770 --> 02:06:26.760
MS Analytics Class 2021: notice it created this red wine quality one right Lee your background is hilarious people are fighting underwater.

961
02:06:28.170 --> 02:06:29.070
Karen Fireman: You get back to it.

962
02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:42.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: So it says down here, right here, so now, when I click on it, so I got a home imported this in the import and it came in and said hey I already had one called red wine quality, so it just automatically added this one to it right.

963
02:06:43.410 --> 02:06:51.570
MS Analytics Class 2021: So what I can do is I can come in here and say rename and then you would say let's say your data set is the ames housing data.

964
02:06:53.370 --> 02:06:54.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you can name a name housing.

965
02:06:56.010 --> 02:06:57.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: When you come here and say.

966
02:06:59.910 --> 02:07:03.570
MS Analytics Class 2021: You know well, excuse me didn't go here and say.

967
02:07:05.250 --> 02:07:06.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: ain't ain't housing right.

968
02:07:12.810 --> 02:07:21.480
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then you'll walk down here you'll put it to your file and go out that's all i'ma show now because I gotta move on for time sake to plus.

969
02:07:21.930 --> 02:07:27.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: You know it's in it's in the this Doc and part of the homework is just you know, making sure.

970
02:07:28.170 --> 02:07:34.920
MS Analytics Class 2021: You get a new one thing you want to check before you turn it in is make sure that and I am going to zoom in just because this is real grain odyssey.

971
02:07:35.820 --> 02:07:40.920
MS Analytics Class 2021: Make sure that when you run it that it actually ran and it shows your email address and.

972
02:07:41.250 --> 02:07:52.170
MS Analytics Class 2021: You know time right, because what i've had people do is they put mine in there, they run it and it didn't actually run and the output still stays there for my it has my name in it and I like okay you didn't actually get it working.

973
02:07:52.620 --> 02:08:01.170
MS Analytics Class 2021: So you want to make sure that if it was working you're gonna see the command took X seconds it's going to have your email address in there and it's going to have a timestamp, but when you did it.

974
02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:07.110
MS Analytics Class 2021: So he turned it in late and he said no, it wasn't late, it was a thing with the problem with.

975
02:08:08.490 --> 02:08:14.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: campus I go well, I have your DVD SCI fi imported it and I can see the timestamp was you know April 1.

976
02:08:14.970 --> 02:08:22.050
MS Analytics Class 2021: aftermarket right, so this will tell on you right so that's just I just want to show you that because that's what i'm going to look at them, I look at your code.

977
02:08:22.260 --> 02:08:29.700
MS Analytics Class 2021: And I don't really have to I can know it all ran because I can look at nice thing about this is everything gets output from me and see I see your name I see the time it ran.

978
02:08:30.570 --> 02:08:42.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: So so that's just kind of a tour of how the database works, the only going to talk about jobs, but you can't use jobs in the Community edition, but the thing about jobs is is you can kind of use.

979
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:48.690
MS Analytics Class 2021: You can use data bricks is your whole environment if you wanted to to implement code and run code.

980
02:08:48.990 --> 02:08:51.120
MS Analytics Class 2021: And things like that, because you can actually in the paid version.

981
02:08:51.360 --> 02:08:56.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: scheduled jobs are run on a schedule and things like that now.

982
02:08:57.720 --> 02:09:06.180
MS Analytics Class 2021: Do I know a lot of people do that not really in the enterprise, you know we're we're using products like as your data factory, which is a.

983
02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:14.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: Integration tool in the cloud and azure that allows me to go and connect to my data sources pull them in and dump them in data like to dump them in databases.

984
02:09:14.910 --> 02:09:20.070
MS Analytics Class 2021: Are dumping whenever and then, in this case the data bricks we use as your data factory that our data sources.

985
02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:27.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: dump our data into our data lake and then our data bricks environment is connected to that data lake it's got permissions to see that data lake.

986
02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:36.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: and see the files that are in that data lake so just kind of think of like a data lake in this instance for what data brick is using as like a file storage in the cloud right.

987
02:09:36.630 --> 02:09:46.290
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it's got some folders and files and different things in there, then I can go to data breaks to connect to my data lake similar I was saying code you saw now, but instead of going to.

988
02:09:46.830 --> 02:09:56.100
MS Analytics Class 2021: To the local file system that the cluster is using i'm going to my data lake during my data and coded and then the same data factory that's move the data into my data lake.

989
02:09:56.700 --> 02:10:03.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: can call these workbooks it has a way to call the workbook centered i'm excuse me, excuse me networks combined workspace and notebooks.

990
02:10:04.110 --> 02:10:10.590
MS Analytics Class 2021: As a way to call these notebooks and running so I might have notebooks that around to do predictions and things that i've written this data breaks, and so this.

991
02:10:10.860 --> 02:10:21.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: And the agile environment, I can have data factory call a workbook that's like my prediction work code that can then say okay take the new data I dumped take the model that I built and train and one of my prediction.

992
02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:29.670
MS Analytics Class 2021: i'll also show you i'll talk about mo net package in a second, but as another way to deploy bottles and whatnot.

993
02:10:30.300 --> 02:10:37.530
MS Analytics Class 2021: So, but you can do jobs and so some people do you know can some environment small shops different things might use the jobs here.

994
02:10:38.130 --> 02:10:45.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: So might not say hey I don't need a data factory I don't need that i'm just I just want to be able to write code at scale and run it, and so they might.

995
02:10:45.780 --> 02:10:52.560
MS Analytics Class 2021: use the data thing bring the data in and their cluster builder models and then skip like jobs in here to run them.

996
02:10:53.160 --> 02:11:07.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: But that is available to you so that's that's that so i'll go back to the slides, and then we got 35 minutes left and talked about a few different technologies and then i'ma show you a couple more demos, and then hopefully say five minutes at the end for.

997
02:11:09.270 --> 02:11:23.130
MS Analytics Class 2021: conversation alright, so my spark i've talked about this a little bit earlier but pi spark is a is a package that allows Python code to run it scale.

998
02:11:24.180 --> 02:11:31.890
MS Analytics Class 2021: In the environment so like that the packages of us are before like SK learn or, if I could learn or.

999
02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:34.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: SCI fi or.

1000
02:11:35.610 --> 02:11:42.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: Some other package you did with Dr Jones class the summer, those are not built per se for park spark.

1001
02:11:42.510 --> 02:11:48.840
MS Analytics Class 2021: They can run an Apache spark because it's just Python so they run like they still run like if you when you look at the red line DEMO I gave you.

1002
02:11:49.140 --> 02:11:57.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: were taking that spark data frame converted it to a pandas data frame, so I can run SK learn so it's like Hitler so they still was still just Python but.

1003
02:11:57.810 --> 02:12:03.690
MS Analytics Class 2021: If you want to take and run your code at scale and take advantage of the fact that you have all these nodes.

1004
02:12:04.020 --> 02:12:12.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: you're going to go and you want to keep your data in a spark data frame and the we're going to use the packages that are available and pi spark if you're using Python.

1005
02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:20.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: To run regressions at scale, so instead of taking these SP learn to run your linear regression you're going to use the linear regression.

1006
02:12:20.970 --> 02:12:27.840
MS Analytics Class 2021: function that's in this m live inside of pie spark and so i'll DEMO this in a second but does that kind of makes sense.

1007
02:12:28.230 --> 02:12:35.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: So, like if you use SK learn, it has to go against the pandas are a nun pie it's just gonna be like a serial operation that's not going to scale out.

1008
02:12:35.670 --> 02:12:45.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: But if you're using Python spark and you're using the libraries that are available and pi spark those have been optimized to run it scale and Apache spark against your.

1009
02:12:46.110 --> 02:12:55.290
MS Analytics Class 2021: pie spark data frames, so that it can so it knows how to chunk that up like I said here, I read this data frame that's got all my data in there and i'm going to use this.

1010
02:12:55.740 --> 02:13:06.390
MS Analytics Class 2021: pie spark library to run my model and knows how to take and vector eyes and spread that code out across these multiple nodes and put it all back together and give me your results.

1011
02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:13.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: Whereas SK learn and things like that they're not built to know how to work in pie part, so what they do, is it just.

1012
02:13:13.530 --> 02:13:25.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: You run your code it just runs it wherever you picked a note note and runs it right, it just runs it as let's talk a serial operation doesn't know how to parallelize it out across the multiple pie spark is what gives you that capability.

1013
02:13:26.850 --> 02:13:37.110
MS Analytics Class 2021: So and there's some links, so you can go and like that bottom link will show you all the libraries and what I DEMO altima library here and pi spark.

1014
02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:55.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: already talked a lot about spark data frames, but it's it's it's it's the structure looks a lot like you know, a pan is data frame data rows and columns and things like that, but it is optimized for running on.

1015
02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:04.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: it's optimized for running at scale with pi spark package so bring your data in.

1016
02:14:05.490 --> 02:14:13.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: Making a spark data frame you saw that and we did that notebook thing, where I brought the csv file and I said open a notebook you saw her and brought it and using the spark data frame commands.

1017
02:14:14.700 --> 02:14:23.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: what's your that spark data frame, you can then use them lives our lives that are in the pie spark against that data frames are on your models at scale.

1018
02:14:25.590 --> 02:14:36.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: Apache arrow I mentioned this earlier So when I remember when I bought my when I showed you the DEMO where I for the red wine I brought the data in as a spark data frame.

1019
02:14:36.810 --> 02:14:53.070
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then at that bottom I had that def to pandas line that she that she using the arrow Apache arrow project behind the scenes to say hey take that spark data frame and quickly convert it to a Panda so it's got optimizations and the arrow has optimizations to know how to to.

1020
02:14:54.240 --> 02:15:03.240
MS Analytics Class 2021: communicate and work between the pandas and a spark and do things like convert files from spark data frames to pandas data frames or.

1021
02:15:04.050 --> 02:15:11.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: Vice versa, so you're not really importing pyro it's already there it's like one of the package is already there and knows how to use it as like think.

1022
02:15:12.420 --> 02:15:22.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: patchy spark to got three, but if you hear the word Apache arrow, I just wanted you to know what it is, because it is you with with patchy spark and dealing with pandas and things like that.

1023
02:15:23.310 --> 02:15:25.920
MS Analytics Class 2021: sparking frame so pandas uds so.

1024
02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:47.160
MS Analytics Class 2021: This came out 2017 ish I want to say and what it was is people, people were like hey is there a way we can still use pandas inside of park park instead of spark but at least do some kind of parallelization some kind of scale, and so what they did is they created this pandas uds.

1025
02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:57.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: vector ization were effectively, you can bring in a pan this data frame and then you can create a function and that function is going to be applied across.

1026
02:15:57.390 --> 02:16:07.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: A grouping of your painters data frame so like if you had a panel data frame that maybe maybe it had like so last year, the example I use is one of my students work for verizon.

1027
02:16:07.710 --> 02:16:13.290
MS Analytics Class 2021: and his project was building time series models for cell towers and so he.

1028
02:16:14.070 --> 02:16:21.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: He ended up having to build different models for each cell tower or for like each type of soul to tell time right so to build a different model who's thinking about it, like.

1029
02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:27.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: The tower that sits right next to city Center it's gonna be different than the tar that sits next to junior high by my house that.

1030
02:16:28.260 --> 02:16:31.560
MS Analytics Class 2021: I use every night of house right through the day it will pre coated.

1031
02:16:31.890 --> 02:16:39.600
MS Analytics Class 2021: No, not a lot of people were home right so wasn't that busy but at night when there's, no one has home phones anymore that towers really busy on the weekend entirely whereas.

1032
02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:49.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: One you know right next to downtown might be busy during the week during the day, but not at night, and on the weekends right and so he had to build models across all those different.

1033
02:16:49.860 --> 02:16:55.860
MS Analytics Class 2021: cell tower the pandas EDF what it did, is it allows it allows you to say Okay, I want to do by grouping.

1034
02:16:56.790 --> 02:17:07.020
MS Analytics Class 2021: apply this function, so what it can say is OK i'm going to do this algorithm for this Tower for this Tower this Tower, and so it knows how to take your data frame and then spread it out.

1035
02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:10.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: and run it in parallel, but it's not the same as if I had.

1036
02:17:11.280 --> 02:17:22.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: 100 million rows of data and I didn't run one model against them hundred million rows I can't use this to do that it's going to it has to be using the spark data frames and pi spark to take advantage of the clustering.

1037
02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:33.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: But this vector ization just gave you a way to say hey it has some data if I group it up, I can apply a function in parallel across different groups of data that's just what they think about it.

1038
02:17:34.020 --> 02:17:39.150
MS Analytics Class 2021: This kind of took over a little bit, but koalas kind of replaced all that, so to speak.

1039
02:17:39.630 --> 02:17:48.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: And the reason being is the smallest package and you saw me import this in earlier it's a pain as API that's on top of patchy spark and What it does is.

1040
02:17:48.570 --> 02:17:56.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: It allows you to work with these allows you to work at scale and spark as if you're in pandas.

1041
02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:06.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so you can bring your data into these Koala data frames and you can do all the same commands that you used to using with pandas but it's going to do it at scale.

1042
02:18:07.110 --> 02:18:22.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: and patchy spark and then, when you're ready to go and build your model, as you know, you can go to a spark data frame and what DEMO this and next I can take that quality data frame converted really quickly just spark data frame and then use.

1043
02:18:23.850 --> 02:18:33.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: The pie spark packages against that data frame to at scale, so you can work with your data at scale as if it's pandas and then, when you're ready to build your model.

1044
02:18:33.450 --> 02:18:42.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: That quality take that calls data frame credit as a spark data frame use the spark spark package to do the models that are available in the pi spark package.

1045
02:18:43.110 --> 02:18:55.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: To then take that part data frame and run your model at scale and then, when you're done, you can output, the results back to a quality data frame so that you can play with it as just like how, with all the same type of.

1046
02:18:57.420 --> 02:19:06.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: functionality, like the same commands that you use for Panda so so the way to think about the quality is like I want to bring data in as a pan is data frame.

1047
02:19:07.530 --> 02:19:16.050
MS Analytics Class 2021: But I want to take advantage of the scaling that Apache gives me or to do that as they wrote the smallest package that no that's aware of.

1048
02:19:16.500 --> 02:19:25.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: Apache spark and clusters and instead of using import pandas SPD we get married an important data bricks koalas as ks.

1049
02:19:26.370 --> 02:19:33.780
MS Analytics Class 2021: But then we can just create these quality data frames and all the same syntax and things that work like to do and pandas works with qualitative friends.

1050
02:19:34.020 --> 02:19:44.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: But their spark aware, and so they know how to take advantage of the spark and so when you issue these commands to slice and do things against your data and a call is data qualitative.

1051
02:19:45.150 --> 02:19:53.790
MS Analytics Class 2021: Data frame, you can do that at scale now you still when you go to build your model at scale you still have to convert it to a spark data frame it's one lot of command.

1052
02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:59.970
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then use the pie spark models against it, then we're done, you can convert it back i'll DEMO this will probably make more sense.

1053
02:20:01.290 --> 02:20:06.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: Everything i've talked to in DEMO so far it's more around batch type data so like we build a model against the red wine data.

1054
02:20:07.350 --> 02:20:16.020
MS Analytics Class 2021: Right, we were just have data at rest right it's just here's X number of observations of wine quality we built the model against it, we predicted.

1055
02:20:16.410 --> 02:20:30.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then hey we consider new predictions in and score well as you send new predictions in the score, we can actually stream that and and the Apache spark API knows how to look at streaming data, so the way this works is.

1056
02:20:30.900 --> 02:20:37.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: Typically, a lot of data lake and you'll have a process that's using what's called don't worry about memorizing this.

1057
02:20:38.220 --> 02:20:46.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: But you get there's technologies like an azure cloud and all them like streaming technologies but know how to stream, the data into your data late.

1058
02:20:46.830 --> 02:20:51.690
MS Analytics Class 2021: there's also a patchy has Kafka has one product that allows it to stream data in a.

1059
02:20:52.170 --> 02:21:02.340
MS Analytics Class 2021: In a format structured format and land it and keep stringing that made it into your data lake and then you can and there's a DEMO right there you click that to kind of see some demos and stuff.

1060
02:21:02.910 --> 02:21:07.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: But so, then you can have a workbook that's running it's continuously running so like the notebooks even notebook.

1061
02:21:08.430 --> 02:21:17.910
MS Analytics Class 2021: You know notebook that's running it's got code in there to know how to watch that it knows it's looking for streaming data so it's just sitting there watching that folder as data streams in.

1062
02:21:18.240 --> 02:21:24.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: it's picking up that data and processing processing it and doing whatever it is, it could be scoring it as a prediction.

1063
02:21:24.930 --> 02:21:34.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: It could be taking the data and doing some data wrangling and then doing a prediction against it, it can be do whatever you want, but the idea is data streaming in to a file location.

1064
02:21:35.670 --> 02:21:44.490
MS Analytics Class 2021: You have a notebook that's running continuously and your data bricks cluster picking up that streaming data and doing something, whether, whether it be predictions.

1065
02:21:44.790 --> 02:21:53.040
MS Analytics Class 2021: Which is a lot of the case, what people are doing, and so, so we like so like if the oil and gas industry we we built algorithms to as.

1066
02:21:53.610 --> 02:22:00.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: Real time drilling, whereas we're drilling lie that data off the censorship rigs are streaming into a location.

1067
02:22:01.080 --> 02:22:08.700
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then we have models that are basically classifying what's happening at that rig as it's drilling, so that we can look for errors are slipping are we.

1068
02:22:08.940 --> 02:22:14.370
MS Analytics Class 2021: going off track and things like that right, and so, as the sensors coming in it's loading that data and stringing into location.

1069
02:22:14.790 --> 02:22:25.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: And you can have a notebook that's that's looking at that location looking at streaming data and storing your that prediction and output and doing different things, but it's running continuously, whereas.

1070
02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:34.830
MS Analytics Class 2021: Before you know I run my notebook was done, I built my model and i'm done right, so you can actually have streaming data, so this this patchy spark API.

1071
02:22:36.120 --> 02:22:36.930
MS Analytics Class 2021: allows for that.

1072
02:22:38.280 --> 02:22:38.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: So.

1073
02:22:40.350 --> 02:22:50.460
MS Analytics Class 2021: Then they'll flow, this is a package it's Open Source data bricks is kind of the main contributor wrote it and the idea here is it's a it's a way to track deploy.

1074
02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:58.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: track your models build your models and your in your projects right, and so the idea here is kind of like a life application lifestyle man.

1075
02:22:59.190 --> 02:23:05.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: management so it's basically a management of your end to end machine learning life cycle right so.

1076
02:23:05.970 --> 02:23:14.790
MS Analytics Class 2021: You can use xml flow packages to to as your training your data is keeping track of your training and then it knows how to go and say deploy it to an.

1077
02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:23.970
MS Analytics Class 2021: azure or deploy to sage maker and Amazon, and so it has these packages to know how to do that, last week I mentioned a product called azure ml.

1078
02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:29.850
MS Analytics Class 2021: And one of the I think it's a DEMO I I won't get the DEMO tonight, but I will I will DEMO it in the video.

1079
02:23:30.210 --> 02:23:37.560
MS Analytics Class 2021: Because I already have it recorded I just need a pad put all together for you, but in the DEMO but all the things that are showing the DEMO is we're in azure ml.

1080
02:23:37.860 --> 02:23:45.810
MS Analytics Class 2021: I can build a model that I can deploy it as a service from the notebook and it's in behind the scenes they're using this ml flow library.

1081
02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:55.050
MS Analytics Class 2021: to automate that deployment for you so it's got calls, where it says Okay, you have this this morning bill Oh, you want to deploy it to an APP service in azure.

1082
02:23:55.470 --> 02:24:02.700
MS Analytics Class 2021: or container and azure is mo flow packages to do that deploy it and then it can test it and do all that, so this is a low flow.

1083
02:24:03.240 --> 02:24:09.150
MS Analytics Class 2021: package what you understand about it is it's it's just a way to have this end to end lifestyle.

1084
02:24:09.930 --> 02:24:18.510
MS Analytics Class 2021: In the end, lifecycle management of your projects right for when you're doing these machine learning projects so there's a link there to DEMO it.

1085
02:24:19.290 --> 02:24:27.570
MS Analytics Class 2021: I haven't used it a whole lot, but I have used it some and some of the things behind the scenes and stuff I got it I got it so when I did this last year.

1086
02:24:28.530 --> 02:24:38.130
MS Analytics Class 2021: I had Kevin is a guy which are data bricks he's my sales REP for my company he sent me a few sample codes that's kind of roll documented it's already pre run.

1087
02:24:38.610 --> 02:24:50.850
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so, those are the BBC files that are in I put those ddc files, so you can add as a BBC or html and your week seven download you can import that in to your Community environment and look at that code.

1088
02:24:51.570 --> 02:24:57.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so the cool thing about these ddc and html files when you import them into your data bricks environment.

1089
02:24:57.780 --> 02:25:03.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: It has all the information from the last time it ran to so when you import some of these demos in.

1090
02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:11.880
MS Analytics Class 2021: Not the red wine, when you can run that one once you put the file there, but like these other ones that have this ml flow that are real documented that you can tell was done by.

1091
02:25:12.300 --> 02:25:15.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: Data bricks themselves so i'll try to run them because you don't have the data and all that.

1092
02:25:15.750 --> 02:25:24.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: And all that stuff will go away, but you know go and look at what the code looks like and look at the output, because then you can kind of see what's going on is that makes sense.

1093
02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:30.930
MS Analytics Class 2021: And if you accidentally try to run it and the stuff goes away or get broken things just delete the notebook and re import it in.

1094
02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:40.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: Does that that's all that information so like when you get done for your project years to give me a BBC file i'm going to open up my Community edition, and I can just look at all your code and see hartman.

1095
02:25:41.460 --> 02:25:48.660
MS Analytics Class 2021: And although you ran it like I showed, you will have your email address on it, the time you're in it, and all that right, and you can't fake it because it's a BBC fox.

1096
02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:51.270
Karen Fireman: How do we save it as a dpc file.

1097
02:25:51.300 --> 02:25:53.490
MS Analytics Class 2021: So export so that's I think that's it.

1098
02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:55.980
MS Analytics Class 2021: yeah I think that's in the document, but if it's.

1099
02:25:55.980 --> 02:25:56.460
Karen Fireman: Not.

1100
02:25:56.610 --> 02:25:59.010
MS Analytics Class 2021: You just use the export you just right click on it and say export.

1101
02:26:00.900 --> 02:26:01.680
MS Analytics Class 2021: I think I have it here.

1102
02:26:02.490 --> 02:26:02.820
Thank you.

1103
02:26:04.830 --> 02:26:06.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: yeah that right there says right there.

1104
02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:18.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: So one don't delay, so I talked about data lakes so data lakes are kind of just file storage is kind of the cloud making that data structures and things like that.

1105
02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:28.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: Another project product that data bricks is working on this is an open source product as well as called delta lakes and so what you can think of it is like.

1106
02:26:28.530 --> 02:26:43.410
MS Analytics Class 2021: database properties inside of your data lake so Center data lake just being a collection of just file sitting out there, they want the ability to make it kind of work like a database, and so it can have support what's called acid trends actions, meaning.

1107
02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:54.450
MS Analytics Class 2021: When you make when you update data, you know it got updated you know it was all done in isolation, like your update didn't affect other stuff things like that, so the properties that databases give you.

1108
02:26:55.110 --> 02:27:04.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: So they're doing all that with the idea of like their their their vision data bricks is is that data delta like will become your next platform for your data.

1109
02:27:05.070 --> 02:27:14.040
MS Analytics Class 2021: Right that's like you'll put your data there well which reality is your transactional systems like your SAP we know your systems that have transactions stuff for now we're going to live in your delta lake.

1110
02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:21.390
MS Analytics Class 2021: anytime soon, but their idea is that they're just trying to make the data lakes, be a little more intelligent.

1111
02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:33.270
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so it has these delta files behind the scenes your what's called a park a format and so i'll just talk about parquet for just two seconds, but park is a binary format it's calmer storage meaning.

1112
02:27:33.630 --> 02:27:42.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: The data is stored in together as as columns not by rose, so all the data is bunched together for column one and then in the file.

1113
02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:53.160
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then column two is where is the next part of the file how i'm free and it's for performance reasons we don't analytics column or storage is faster and so these delta lake.

1114
02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:59.970
MS Analytics Class 2021: Data lakes are storing the data as these parquet files, they have all these helper files around it to know oh you updated.

1115
02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:10.920
MS Analytics Class 2021: This data, so it knows that oh you updated it, and if you want to go back to do like time travel where you can say all of this data with like yesterday, it has all these delta things and it's keeping track of to give you that capability.

1116
02:28:12.300 --> 02:28:24.570
MS Analytics Class 2021: If some people are using it is catching on but just I just want you to know if you hear the word delta late and data bricks that's what it is it's like this intelligent data lay that brings a.

1117
02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:33.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: database type properties to your data lake in other words, you might hear it so here data lake in other words, right here is lake house.

1118
02:28:34.170 --> 02:28:46.620
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so, like houses are our data lakes in conjunction with like data warehousing so the azure setups analytics product, I talked about last week for a few minutes that had a data lake and had sequel servers and it had.

1119
02:28:47.100 --> 02:28:54.690
MS Analytics Class 2021: pipelines, all these different things that's what you'll hear the word like a lake house is industry terminal here and so it's the combination of data lakes.

1120
02:28:55.230 --> 02:29:03.930
MS Analytics Class 2021: relational databases and data warehousing, and all this stuff on this one product, but for data bricks and this term delta lake is.

1121
02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:23.040
MS Analytics Class 2021: An intelligent data leak, so instead of just like file seen on storage in the cloud, these are file co storage in the cloud specific format, with specific functionality and api's to support it kind of acting more like a database so for more reliable and and so.

1122
02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:27.120
MS Analytics Class 2021: that's the slide so very tough project.

1123
02:29:27.330 --> 02:29:29.310
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let me show a few more demos, we have what like.

1124
02:29:29.730 --> 02:29:32.850
MS Analytics Class 2021: 20 minutes or so let me show a few demos, and then.

1125
02:29:34.380 --> 02:29:36.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: leave some room for questions and.

1126
02:29:38.880 --> 02:29:40.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: So I go back to the Community edition here.

1127
02:29:43.470 --> 02:29:50.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: i'll make this big so in foster with the quality one so and the.

1128
02:29:51.660 --> 02:30:00.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: downloads here, so the others do by type, so you have the PDF which I just showed you.

1129
02:30:00.600 --> 02:30:07.590
MS Analytics Class 2021: You have this real time deployment, so these two right here, these oh four oh and G, these are those two samples that I talked about that.

1130
02:30:08.550 --> 02:30:22.500
MS Analytics Class 2021: Data bricks gave me to show you a little bit about ml flow, you have an example of what the code might look like for ml flow both of those have ml flow in there one rights to html one lights to azure machine learning and the other one rights to.

1131
02:30:23.910 --> 02:30:30.930
MS Analytics Class 2021: aws if you try to run them they're not going to actually write to aws or azure it's just showing you what that code would look like to do i'll.

1132
02:30:31.290 --> 02:30:39.390
MS Analytics Class 2021: i'll show you that in a second, if I have time, if not it's well documented it's just it's just something as a sample for you can see right the data bricks katie but the things that.

1133
02:30:39.780 --> 02:30:46.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: I want to show you today are red wine for quality and red wine quality and so we'll start with red wine quality actually because that's.

1134
02:30:46.530 --> 02:30:54.570
MS Analytics Class 2021: What your homework is, and I think I showed you this already but effectively all we're doing here is we're trying to train was caught elastic net is a psychic learn.

1135
02:30:55.590 --> 02:30:59.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: So we did the data we brought in our file, this is where it was located.

1136
02:31:01.020 --> 02:31:13.050
MS Analytics Class 2021: So read so remember, I told you, these percent are called magic commands so I did percent Python you don't read percent Python notebooks of Python So if you don't do a magic command it's going to be a Python cell.

1137
02:31:13.590 --> 02:31:32.100
MS Analytics Class 2021: But you have these little magic and so percent fs says hey list right go to the Google file system and list that so that's what that percent fs is doing oh my gosh look at that baby Brian oh my gosh that's so cute at the pinky and everything off boy or girl.

1138
02:31:34.440 --> 02:31:37.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: Oh you're muted i'll wait i'll keep talking and you can tell me.

1139
02:31:37.860 --> 02:31:46.860
Brian Frankel: If it's a boy sorry, and since I have the floor had a quick question right i'm a delta like cannot handle unstructured data like check images and things.

1140
02:31:46.860 --> 02:31:52.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: yeah absolutely yeah absolutely so Brian that's good Chris good question because see.

1141
02:31:53.640 --> 02:31:58.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: When you talk about relational databases you're doing talking about structured data data that has columns and rows right.

1142
02:31:58.800 --> 02:32:03.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: But when you're talking about a data lake it could be structured data or it can be unstructured data so unstructured data.

1143
02:32:04.050 --> 02:32:13.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: is data that might not have a structure, like a column or a row, like a data frame right, and so it might be json documents or it could just be just raw files I don't have.

1144
02:32:13.890 --> 02:32:20.100
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so, but that delta lake is still a data lake it just has these asset properties and so as you don't files.

1145
02:32:21.090 --> 02:32:32.340
MS Analytics Class 2021: You can go back and kind of time travel to the different files right, so it doesn't it's not like taking everything and making it structure so without saying hey Dr lake is not a relational database it's just giving you that that.

1146
02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:40.170
MS Analytics Class 2021: Data lake with some properties that are that relational databases have like transactions and time travel that makes sense.

1147
02:32:41.400 --> 02:32:55.020
Brian Frankel: It doesn't question is, will just because specifically we're dealing with the Bank in Texas, is trying to do this, so can you also index this way as well, to make it so you can find these particular structured data points and unstructured data points.

1148
02:32:55.380 --> 02:33:08.640
MS Analytics Class 2021: So by index, do you mean like a data like index looking So do you mean and that's the stuff like an index and the database we index a table, or do you mean index, in the sense, like, I have a data catalogs and or my data is in my data lake.

1149
02:33:09.120 --> 02:33:10.140
Brian Frankel: The second.

1150
02:33:10.410 --> 02:33:23.160
MS Analytics Class 2021: So the second one is that's me start my my data catalog so in the azure side that's when you get into products called as your purview so it actually, as you can go look at your database and catalog all the data that's in that data lake.

1151
02:33:24.330 --> 02:33:39.840
MS Analytics Class 2021: there's other products like believers and other one there's other data catalog products that can do that I don't know delta lake has a haven't got into the into the delta lake as much I don't know if they have like a cataloguing piece right where it's showing you what's there but.

1152
02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:45.840
MS Analytics Class 2021: And you can fact we could like code to to do it, but there are like if you're dealing with like say azure.

1153
02:33:46.260 --> 02:33:50.490
MS Analytics Class 2021: A big product they have now is called purview it's which used to be agitated catalog.

1154
02:33:50.820 --> 02:33:54.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: And now it's aggregator catalog version two and a bunch of other stuff where.

1155
02:33:54.270 --> 02:34:06.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: They can go look at all the data, you have in your environment, whether it's on premise in the cloud or this in a database in a data lake wherever catalog what's out there and let you put tags and metadata put experts and things like that.

1156
02:34:06.780 --> 02:34:14.460
MS Analytics Class 2021: So I mean July we start talking about cataloguing you're talking about a product to playing with their Jose tossing the ball there oh.

1157
02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:18.570
MS Analytics Class 2021: that's the dog is that a golden doodle.

1158
02:34:19.770 --> 02:34:21.210
Jose Adan Prego: Yet is the doodle good.

1159
02:34:21.450 --> 02:34:29.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: Alright cool alright, so I go to code, we got 30 minutes but good question by and then, so this is just like fs this is.

1160
02:34:30.420 --> 02:34:37.020
MS Analytics Class 2021: Issuing commands at the files and that's these magic command you're doing so, then I said this is bringing it as a spark data frame.

1161
02:34:37.770 --> 02:34:46.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: You know, and then here down here we're going to where we're going to make it a pandas I don't think we actually use non pie here I can't remember if we do a.

1162
02:34:47.070 --> 02:35:05.520
MS Analytics Class 2021: lot of times that just do not pie and pandas as default when i'm working with our user we're not but then we're going to do sky it's a psychic learn so that's why down here, I have this to pandas right because remember we're not dealing with we're dealing with non spark aware.

1163
02:35:06.630 --> 02:35:12.480
MS Analytics Class 2021: code and psychic learn it doesn't know how to deal with Apache spark in the sense that it doesn't know how to scale out but remember.

1164
02:35:12.810 --> 02:35:18.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: it's still just Python one of these nodes going it's going to happen here because we're using psychic learn and using a penis data frame.

1165
02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:24.450
MS Analytics Class 2021: it's just going to run it like if I was running on this PC you're going to gain really anything with the spark environment there.

1166
02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:30.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: But I just wanted something simple so that you can learn how to import a notebook learn how to edit.

1167
02:35:30.750 --> 02:35:40.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: The code in that notebook or how to play with the clusters, or how to install a package, if you need to learn how to to just get familiar with data set it up right now.

1168
02:35:41.010 --> 02:35:48.690
MS Analytics Class 2021: This stuff is pretty easy so just walk through this now, what do I show you now because of 12 minutes is I will show you pi spark and Koala so.

1169
02:35:49.500 --> 02:35:57.090
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is just a sample this article I just kind of use the red wine data, and I use this article to kind of build the code we're gonna do.

1170
02:35:57.450 --> 02:36:13.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: we're going to do a regression, although we have classified data for one quality but ignore that, for now, this is all I had time to build because it's kind of a last minute thing I was like Oh, I need to show koalas and then so we're going to do a regression model, but you can.

1171
02:36:14.820 --> 02:36:24.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: there's other package in Africa his other packages and pie spark that have classifier right, so you can edit this go get a classifier because really the wind posit classifier.

1172
02:36:24.660 --> 02:36:36.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: and make a class with our, but let me walk through what the codes doing, because you still can treat this like a regression right predicting why from access for a walk through what's going on, so we're importing data bricks koalas.

1173
02:36:37.140 --> 02:36:39.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: And I import seaborne someone us a little later on here.

1174
02:36:41.700 --> 02:36:43.050
MS Analytics Class 2021: So i'm using.

1175
02:36:44.400 --> 02:36:56.280
MS Analytics Class 2021: The import qualities chaos, I do ks read csv This is just like do like data frame right pandas data frame PD read, so if I did this with Panda data frames, I can say.

1176
02:36:57.600 --> 02:37:05.640
MS Analytics Class 2021: Import pandas as PD and just to show you, I can say Panda data frame equals.

1177
02:37:07.260 --> 02:37:12.120
MS Analytics Class 2021: And if you ever start teaching like I do generally don't edit your demos like this.

1178
02:37:13.320 --> 02:37:21.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is like blow up as you saw earlier, but this should work right the idea here is and then i'm going to say i'm going to say.

1179
02:37:24.390 --> 02:37:24.750
hi.

1180
02:37:27.090 --> 02:37:38.370
MS Analytics Class 2021: Say PDF right so i'm gonna run this cell is running i'm gonna talk so it's got a bunch of code down here, and you see right here, where it says file not found who.

1181
02:37:39.570 --> 02:37:40.110
MS Analytics Class 2021: Oh.

1182
02:37:42.810 --> 02:37:46.620
MS Analytics Class 2021: This is what happened so i'm going to take back a statement I made earlier Karen.

1183
02:37:47.730 --> 02:37:51.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: If you remove the cluster terminate your file will go away.

1184
02:37:52.530 --> 02:37:54.540
Karen Fireman: The file meaning this finally in mind.

1185
02:37:54.600 --> 02:38:07.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: yeah, so this is so my old cluster was still there and it, let me restart it so If so, for whatever reason it wouldn't let me restart it again, so I thought, maybe they took that away so.

1186
02:38:08.400 --> 02:38:18.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: Before you delete your if you come back to your Community I don't play in the Community edition that watch how I do have class right, I have like seven I have like seven or eight paid versions of data bricks the office.

1187
02:38:19.320 --> 02:38:23.880
MS Analytics Class 2021: I work with and so sometimes they change what happens in Community edition so.

1188
02:38:24.450 --> 02:38:31.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: If you come back in your things that's terminated, there should be a little start to start it I could never get mine to restart when I was here earlier.

1189
02:38:31.920 --> 02:38:48.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: Apparently it obviously worked earlier that restarted my files, they are so if your cluster still there and it's terminated, it should come up, but if you get this air it's easy to fix right, so, if you remember when I came over here and I did this 235 right here.

1190
02:38:49.620 --> 02:38:51.450
MS Analytics Class 2021: I just I can just go and grab this.

1191
02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:55.500
MS Analytics Class 2021: Come back to my calls right here.

1192
02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:10.500
MS Analytics Class 2021: And this is why I like when I do my what I do this is why I showed you this part, and so I did a great table I like doing as a notebook was going to give me the command and it's going to put my file path in there right.

1193
02:39:12.060 --> 02:39:17.250
MS Analytics Class 2021: So yeah, so I think that I take back my statement in the Community edition I don't deal in environment where my.

1194
02:39:17.670 --> 02:39:18.750
MS Analytics Class 2021: I don't deal with environment.

1195
02:39:18.780 --> 02:39:26.550
MS Analytics Class 2021: Work for my cluster ever disappears, it might shut down but but yeah you're right, it does it does remove the fall I wasn't.

1196
02:39:27.810 --> 02:39:31.290
Karen Fireman: Even mistake there it's double double double double.

1197
02:39:31.470 --> 02:39:32.400
MS Analytics Class 2021: Up sorry thanks Karen.

1198
02:39:32.490 --> 02:39:35.550
MS Analytics Class 2021: I didn't see that it dropped that anyone I copied it Thank you.

1199
02:39:36.810 --> 02:39:38.160
MS Analytics Class 2021: So let's try that again.

1200
02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:47.280
Karen Fireman: So does errs run I mean it had that limitation of one node or do you ever problem running this thing because we only can do one note.

1201
02:39:47.310 --> 02:39:53.130
MS Analytics Class 2021: Though yeah no problem, no problem you won't have a problem, why is this.

1202
02:39:55.650 --> 02:40:01.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: Is this not working, I just did this red wine to read to.

1203
02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:07.290
MS Analytics Class 2021: Read Oh, I see that I copy the wrong thing.

1204
02:40:08.820 --> 02:40:15.840
MS Analytics Class 2021: I know this works, because this just works right so let's go back here let's go back to I was breaking because you can kind of see how troubleshoot right.

1205
02:40:19.590 --> 02:40:20.190
Why is that.

1206
02:40:22.410 --> 02:40:22.830
working.

1207
02:40:24.780 --> 02:40:26.040
On second let's see something.

1208
02:40:28.140 --> 02:40:28.740
To me.

1209
02:40:31.080 --> 02:40:32.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: that's Okay, should this should still work.

1210
02:40:33.990 --> 02:40:36.120
MS Analytics Class 2021: i'm not sure why this isn't working hold on one second.

1211
02:40:37.230 --> 02:40:38.460
I will get it working nori.

1212
02:40:44.460 --> 02:40:52.320
MS Analytics Class 2021: file not found does not exist, foster so let's just do this alone let's just go to data secret table and say Brown.

1213
02:40:53.460 --> 02:40:54.600
MS Analytics Class 2021: let's say why holly.

1214
02:40:56.280 --> 02:40:57.390
MS Analytics Class 2021: let's scrap that.

1215
02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:01.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: that's a great day will not book.

1216
02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:05.760
MS Analytics Class 2021: Oh, I don't, the problem is for one second I know I think I know is.

1217
02:41:06.900 --> 02:41:08.520
MS Analytics Class 2021: let's run off.

1218
02:41:12.690 --> 02:41:15.780
MS Analytics Class 2021: So that worked on one, second, let me, let me go file.

1219
02:41:17.370 --> 02:41:22.080
MS Analytics Class 2021: score here works basically one, second, let me see something important.

1220
02:41:23.310 --> 02:41:28.680
A browse but we re import wallace to give me a new name here.

1221
02:41:31.380 --> 02:41:33.630
that's that should work so let's go back here.

1222
02:41:38.940 --> 02:41:44.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: A horse I can actually be jays class let's go right here to here.

1223
02:41:48.630 --> 02:41:50.700
It should work I don't know why it's not working.

1224
02:41:56.130 --> 02:41:56.340
So.

1225
02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:05.190
Far not found red wine does not exist.

1226
02:42:08.580 --> 02:42:15.300
MS Analytics Class 2021: Oh, this is the Panda thing I know it is, I think it's going to be dbs.

1227
02:42:17.040 --> 02:42:25.800
MS Analytics Class 2021: I think I hear me shake it's so as a shortcut I was going to ask sorry this is, this is why arrested don't DEMO it's not the quality ones that's breaking.

1228
02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:50.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: it's the it's this one is because in pandas it needs this db pandas is not spark a weird the true path is D bfs colon So if you look down here whenever so here, I do it this way, but if i'm learning the pandas I believe i'm going to need the bfs like that.

1229
02:42:51.720 --> 02:42:53.640
MS Analytics Class 2021: Cohen, and let's see if this works.

1230
02:42:58.770 --> 02:42:58.950
Oh.

1231
02:43:01.050 --> 02:43:05.790
MS Analytics Class 2021: I might have to just comment that on come back to TV fs colon.

1232
02:43:17.850 --> 02:43:29.610
MS Analytics Class 2021: i'm saying this doesn't work on my comment on i'm not sure why it's not working something's weird it has, this is what i'm doing is it's on this path and has to do with it has to do with.

1233
02:43:31.110 --> 02:43:38.130
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay, you slash DPS okay that's what it is sorry that's how many well if I just slow down and read.

1234
02:43:39.210 --> 02:43:40.170
MS Analytics Class 2021: It told me what to do.

1235
02:43:41.490 --> 02:43:42.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: It said, you see here.

1236
02:43:45.480 --> 02:43:51.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: Okay i'll come back to them or comment this out and if we have time in a second i'll play with it, because this is not important.

1237
02:43:51.960 --> 02:43:56.100
MS Analytics Class 2021: But I was just trying to what I was trying to show you is if I get the file system right.

1238
02:43:56.670 --> 02:44:09.450
MS Analytics Class 2021: This stuff is the same right the Read CVs for koalas is the same how you would do it for pandas data frame the difference here is because we're in a spark cluster and pandas it's not aware it's really wanting us to.

1239
02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:18.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: To look at actually hold on one second bear with me guys in a hurry hurry you guys give me two more minutes I can get this working.

1240
02:44:23.790 --> 02:44:29.760
MS Analytics Class 2021: yeah okay welcome back, so let me, let me so we can track and walk through koalas and you can understand it.

1241
02:44:30.210 --> 02:44:33.150
MS Analytics Class 2021: will walk through koalas and then i'll come back and figure out why this isn't.

1242
02:44:33.150 --> 02:44:40.680
MS Analytics Class 2021: running so I just commented out the pandas data frame one, but the point I was trying to make here was once you got the once you get the path right.

1243
02:44:41.580 --> 02:44:54.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: This should work, but the idea is it still take that koalas is supposed to be like a one for one syntax to pandas right, even though it's spark aware as doing things at scale.

1244
02:44:54.720 --> 02:45:04.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: it's supposed to be a one to one syntax for for for spark that's what I was trying to show there, but I wasn't getting the file path right for whatever, for whatever reason.

1245
02:45:09.870 --> 02:45:18.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: So that's just all running so let's just walk through what this is doing, while it's running so importing my paula's imported pandas here to make this work, but didn't so.

1246
02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:32.310
MS Analytics Class 2021: So i'm just showing the tight, so what what type is the Koala data frame, so I come down here, you can see it's a it's a data bricks koalas data frame.

1247
02:45:33.330 --> 02:45:39.330
MS Analytics Class 2021: But I have functionality to take that quality and making a pandas data frame using to pandas.

1248
02:45:40.350 --> 02:45:51.180
MS Analytics Class 2021: Or if I needed as a spark data frame I used to spark to get the spark data frame right, and so, if you remember the idea here is.

1249
02:45:51.660 --> 02:45:59.460
MS Analytics Class 2021: You can use Koala to bring your data frame the data in and to quality data frame you all the massaging and things you need to do.

1250
02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:09.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: In pandas that you're comfortable with and then, when you're ready to build your model and pi spark you just come down here and use the.

1251
02:46:10.800 --> 02:46:17.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: to spark function to convert it to spark right, so you create a spark data frame with the to spark so.

1252
02:46:17.790 --> 02:46:26.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: So we bring our data in just showed you the tights showed you the column, so you can see down here, where I just showed you the columns and different things, you can see where they came in.

1253
02:46:27.420 --> 02:46:36.480
MS Analytics Class 2021: Right, and so I then I have to create it to export data frame and then I import in some packages from pi spark.

1254
02:46:36.870 --> 02:46:55.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: These packages are Apache spark aware right they know how to operate at scale across these clusters these notes, and so this gbt aggressor is a grab bag was dpt stand for gradient boosting sorry I believe aggressor.

1255
02:46:56.610 --> 02:47:01.260
MS Analytics Class 2021: it's just a regression algorithm it's not the stuff the psychic, but when it's the pie spark what right.

1256
02:47:01.620 --> 02:47:11.280
MS Analytics Class 2021: And so, this is like having a psychic learn like that this is coming out of high spark in the fly right, so this is the MOP the algorithm we use, and you can see, this down here.

1257
02:47:11.730 --> 02:47:20.250
MS Analytics Class 2021: To build our model right, and then we have this vector similar and what this is is this assemblers what's going to take all our exes and put them into one column.

1258
02:47:20.700 --> 02:47:26.850
MS Analytics Class 2021: In a vector, and the reason it does that so that I can it's a requirement for these high spark packages.

1259
02:47:27.210 --> 02:47:35.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: so that I can do things faster at scale and and through vector ization right and then we're bringing the regression evaluator so we can evaluate our model did.

1260
02:47:35.820 --> 02:47:44.430
MS Analytics Class 2021: But we're not using what you're used to using and Dr Jones right, so I can't learn or five higher things like that we're using the actual pi spark now so.

1261
02:47:45.210 --> 02:47:55.950
MS Analytics Class 2021: So we bring those packages in, and then we have to create this vector similar so What it does is to say, these are all our exes, so I do those x's and then.

1262
02:47:56.700 --> 02:48:03.720
MS Analytics Class 2021: My output column is one column, that is, the vector eyes version of all my exes so if we come out here, we can see that, right here.

1263
02:48:04.140 --> 02:48:11.820
MS Analytics Class 2021: That you see that right there on the zoom in real quick so close your eyes for a second So you see, we have alcohol sulfate, this is a vector eyes version of.

1264
02:48:12.210 --> 02:48:21.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: All of those right so 747 4.0 7.7 all the way out to nine for that makes sense, so that's what this command is doing is it's creating this.

1265
02:48:23.220 --> 02:48:32.580
MS Analytics Class 2021: vector similar doing screen that and then we use this vector similar transform to to to to.

1266
02:48:33.660 --> 02:48:49.830
MS Analytics Class 2021: to actually create this creates this special data type that has it will praise the spark data frame that has this vector eyes version in it right here, right and so when I when I did this command here, I did the show this is what's showing you that that data frame with that vector ization.

1267
02:48:51.000 --> 02:49:01.380
MS Analytics Class 2021: So, now that we have that we can split the data, so we can use this random split function as a split 7030 and then it's going to split and it's going to split up.

1268
02:49:01.950 --> 02:49:14.700
MS Analytics Class 2021: A zero and one so system split up you have two inputs here, so the first input or grab as a train the 70% and then the first the first the second one, this one we're gonna grab as our test right.

1269
02:49:15.510 --> 02:49:26.040
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then we're gonna go use the training data set to build our dresser so the features calm So these are the feature calls is our exes right that's that vector ization we did.

1270
02:49:26.430 --> 02:49:33.000
MS Analytics Class 2021: Our label call is or why that's quality right we'd have to do anything special with quality we'd have to vector eyes are at that because it's just one fault.

1271
02:49:33.300 --> 02:49:42.540
MS Analytics Class 2021: One column, so we pull it we end up getting a vector quality right and so that's these quality, so this is our why, and this is this vector ization of all our exes.

1272
02:49:43.140 --> 02:49:54.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then we fit our model so so go out and it's to take advantage of all the nodes we have in this case it gets to the Community edition and spread that workload out and so that's when come down here, you can see.

1273
02:49:55.380 --> 02:50:00.870
MS Analytics Class 2021: Where they go Oh, the map, right here sorry, you can see, all this stuff there's there are some.

1274
02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:10.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: When it was all right here, you can see here it's all these jobs, all these stages right you see where I split all this up to stage, all this up to go.

1275
02:50:11.010 --> 02:50:20.310
MS Analytics Class 2021: and run your code and so you can see where it's right here, where it's where it's vector rising all you know this out and and paralyzing all this out in our cluster right.

1276
02:50:22.230 --> 02:50:34.710
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then we just do the simple evaluations and then, when we're done, we can convert back to a quality data frame, so that we have it, just like data frame that's pan is aware, so we can do things like.

1277
02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:37.050
MS Analytics Class 2021: printed and.

1278
02:50:38.340 --> 02:50:45.540
MS Analytics Class 2021: And like map plot line so you can see, this is just a map plot live print right here, right and so that makes sense.

1279
02:50:46.200 --> 02:50:58.110
MS Analytics Class 2021: So kind of as a high level we use koalas to bring in our csv file Craig quality data frame we convert it to a spark data frame and we could do things with it, so we bring those call data from.

1280
02:50:58.830 --> 02:51:12.060
MS Analytics Class 2021: US me for speaking fast for a second we bring this quality data frame in we can just use all the same API commands are familiar with pandas to mess with our data and do things and it's gonna do it at scale, because the Koala.

1281
02:51:13.350 --> 02:51:19.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: The Koala package has the syntax of pandas, but it has the awareness.

1282
02:51:19.740 --> 02:51:26.760
MS Analytics Class 2021: Of Apache spark so it knows how to take advantage of the clusters and do it to do all this stuff at scale.

1283
02:51:27.480 --> 02:51:34.020
MS Analytics Class 2021: Like what you would do again is the only thing you need to do, though, is when you want to actually build your model, you have to do create it to a spark data frame.

1284
02:51:34.470 --> 02:51:52.020
MS Analytics Class 2021: so that you can use the spy part pot pie spark ml live to build your model and using these you don't use the psychic learn against that spark data frame you use the high spark is that those those models are aware of.

1285
02:51:53.340 --> 02:52:07.170
MS Analytics Class 2021: Of Apache spark and those models are know how to work with spark data frame which is a special type of data frame that can be scaled out, and then we have that vector some where we had to do we split we train make sense.

1286
02:52:09.150 --> 02:52:12.420
MS Analytics Class 2021: So, and then that's really all I have.

1287
02:52:13.770 --> 02:52:14.520
MS Analytics Class 2021: is far as.

1288
02:52:15.660 --> 02:52:17.880
MS Analytics Class 2021: All this stuff is just a DEMO I showed earlier.

1289
02:52:19.560 --> 02:52:21.870
Karen Fireman: than one that we can run this when you.

1290
02:52:22.200 --> 02:52:23.400
MS Analytics Class 2021: Think about that absolutely.

1291
02:52:23.460 --> 02:52:30.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: You just there you'll see oh right you'll see like wine red wine or white quality flawless you bring it in the only thing you need to change.

1292
02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:34.740
MS Analytics Class 2021: Is whatever you just make sure you import my the.

1293
02:52:34.830 --> 02:52:40.920
MS Analytics Class 2021: red wine quality file and wherever you put it just change that one spot right there everything else can stay the same, and you can run.

1294
02:52:42.240 --> 02:52:48.210
MS Analytics Class 2021: And if you want to get adventurous, and you don't want to do if you don't want to do the pandas way for your project.

1295
02:52:48.480 --> 02:52:56.400
MS Analytics Class 2021: If you say hey I don't want to do the pandas one where I take my data bring it in convert to pandas you psychic learn, and you want to do this, one either one I don't care right.

1296
02:52:56.790 --> 02:53:01.200
MS Analytics Class 2021: They both have the same thing you're bringing your own data and you split it up and.

1297
02:53:01.770 --> 02:53:19.140
MS Analytics Class 2021: you give me one BBC, whether you use red wine for quality or you use red one quality that's using the standard just Python stuff your choice, so let me show you one thing real quick and then we'll call it a night and then, but I will I will.

1298
02:53:20.550 --> 02:53:25.020
MS Analytics Class 2021: Let you guys obviously ask questions or but didn't cover something so one thing I want to click is this.

1299
02:53:27.570 --> 02:53:30.960
MS Analytics Class 2021: And oh that linkedin work i'll fix that tomorrow that's weird.

1300
02:53:32.370 --> 02:53:35.970
MS Analytics Class 2021: Sorry, I thought I clicked always I always.

1301
02:53:38.670 --> 02:53:44.790
MS Analytics Class 2021: So this is this is where I thought that link was going Oh, they change it to point Oh, but if you look right here.

1302
02:53:46.080 --> 02:53:49.770
MS Analytics Class 2021: So if you come right here and i'll update i'll update this.

1303
02:53:51.390 --> 02:53:55.530
MS Analytics Class 2021: Over the weekend and the PDF and fix the links are really trying to show you.

1304
02:53:55.830 --> 02:54:12.570
MS Analytics Class 2021: See, these are in the in the in live package price Park, these are all like the regression see like the Christian logistic regression models, you know for vector machines naive bayes clustering stuff right they have some evaluation, so it doesn't have everything you know that.

1305
02:54:13.830 --> 02:54:21.030
MS Analytics Class 2021: That you have with the other packages and Python right, but it has a lot of the main ones, and so a couple things.

1306
02:54:21.750 --> 02:54:31.290
MS Analytics Class 2021: scala is the data is the native languages sparks written in some packages, like some of the gradient boosting packages and they I think they might have some now for pi spark but.

1307
02:54:31.680 --> 02:54:39.270
MS Analytics Class 2021: Last year, like a gradient boosting was like actually boost it was a scholar only type of thing that you had a run in the actual like scala code you couldn't use Python.

1308
02:54:40.020 --> 02:54:49.350
MS Analytics Class 2021: So they have because Gala is the language of Apache spark for it, and then you know it tends to have some more available packages that pie spark might not have.

1309
02:54:49.740 --> 02:54:57.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: was effectively what people are doing is somebody maintaining a pipe parks high spark package to kind of keep up and build these algorithms to make them.

1310
02:54:58.410 --> 02:55:06.360
MS Analytics Class 2021: aware and run and Apache so if this is me, and this is like the Apache spark this is kind of the de facto.

1311
02:55:07.260 --> 02:55:16.680
MS Analytics Class 2021: environment that people are going to to run their their code and scale data bricks is the leader there, the company that created it their stuffs pretty cool.

1312
02:55:17.370 --> 02:55:23.220
MS Analytics Class 2021: I didn't show you I said sin Apps analytics last week it doesn't use data bricks but does use Apache spark.

1313
02:55:23.670 --> 02:55:30.930
MS Analytics Class 2021: So, like I could take the code I just show you, it will still run and in the data bricks and the Apache spark clusters.

1314
02:55:31.890 --> 02:55:40.860
MS Analytics Class 2021: they're just not the data variant and the data brilliant has some extra code to make it go faster like you know because because they own the code they they.

1315
02:55:41.220 --> 02:55:55.500
MS Analytics Class 2021: kind of contribute to open source to make it really good and usable but they keep back a little bit to make their product for you want to pay for it right, and so, but you can see, this environment it's really easy to use, like if you need it to to quickly scale up a company at a high.

1316
02:55:56.640 --> 02:56:05.100
MS Analytics Class 2021: I mean a rapid environment to scale and build models of scale, I mean how easy is this, I mean I mean i'll give you example our.

1317
02:56:05.490 --> 02:56:17.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: Our business users up in Denver for my company for years ago I went up there just an all day workshop and I showed him data factory and data lakes and sequel server and data bricks and how to move the data in our pipeline.

1318
02:56:17.550 --> 02:56:22.650
MS Analytics Class 2021: And these are like engineers, you know it people, and these are engineers there's, not a single it person there other than me.

1319
02:56:23.370 --> 02:56:31.920
MS Analytics Class 2021: And it's all cloud base I showed them how this all works and like oh eight hour workshop, and for two years, they have built hundreds of models and data bricks.

1320
02:56:32.340 --> 02:56:39.630
MS Analytics Class 2021: And data factory and data lake where they're taking data factory moving their data into the data lake taking data bricks connecting to it.

1321
02:56:39.990 --> 02:56:48.900
MS Analytics Class 2021: Building out their models calling data factory to score miles predictive models out putting the results to a sequel server database and then putting the power bi report on top of it for the.

1322
02:56:49.350 --> 02:57:00.300
MS Analytics Class 2021: Other engineers to look at and say hey you know which models that we build last night, how does, how does things look, you know, based upon the bottles, we ran an automated last night so.

1323
02:57:01.410 --> 02:57:07.920
MS Analytics Class 2021: It was just it's so made super rapid like I can I can set up a productions secure.

1324
02:57:09.180 --> 02:57:16.230
MS Analytics Class 2021: high performance analytics platform and data bricks and minutes really so that being said.

1325
02:57:17.850 --> 02:57:22.440
MS Analytics Class 2021: I think it's time to call it a night, but I will stay here, as long as you want to ask me questions.

1326
02:57:23.430 --> 02:57:35.190
MS Analytics Class 2021: you're free to go a couple of reminders you didn't turn one into get it turned in before the 18th i'll still great it, I will take 10 points off stuff for people that are on time they'll get full credit if they did everything right.

1327
02:57:36.750 --> 02:57:52.050
MS Analytics Class 2021: And then get your project in, we will have office hours Monday i'll be there, the following Monday, Dr hartman will start oh you've already had him for a day and he'll start doing the office hours That being said, your projects, I do the 18th right so on the the.

1328
02:57:53.100 --> 02:57:53.850
I guess that's gonna be.

1329
02:57:54.900 --> 02:58:06.600
MS Analytics Class 2021: 15th is a Monday so he'll be doing the office hours that 15th but, that being said, you know your projects, I do the 18th, you have my cell phone, you have my email.

1330
02:58:07.110 --> 02:58:11.550
MS Analytics Class 2021: text me send me an email and say hey i'm stuck or hey you know I need your help.
