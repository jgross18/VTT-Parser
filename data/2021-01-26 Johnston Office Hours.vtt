00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.280
Karen Fireman: i'm i'm just throwing this out here as an idea.

41
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.150
But.

42
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:46.470
Karen Fireman: Whoever has specific questions, of course, but it's felt to me like it was very fast during class and I wondered if it's possible that we might review some of those things just because I felt like you were on like you know 78 nine needed on 33 that you know record.

43
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.940
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.530
Karen Fireman: go over i'm i'm behind, so I don't want to mess everybody else up I I just really.

49
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.250
Faculty Office Hours: No, no, no, no.

50
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:25.740
Karen Fireman: I mean we're here, for we don't have to do that i'll probably have to do that myself, but if you went through things again it wouldn't hurt me but just whatever people want to talk about, but if you don't have anything to talk about like repeat would be great.

51
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:37.950
Faculty Office Hours: Oh, when you say repeat, you know, obviously I went over setting up your environment and all that, I mean is there anything particular like just like creating the content environments and things like that or.

52
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.560
Karen Fireman: i'm just too far behind.

53
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.820

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.520
Faculty Office Hours: Okay, so if I come right here.

83
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:12.390
Faculty Office Hours: Then we get down here the Python is so coming through here, you know just installing environment right and my anaconda are many condo I prefer many condo.

84
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:21.900
Faculty Office Hours: And so that you know I just click that link and then go to the let me, you know I go through here.

85
00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.500
Faculty Office Hours: Go to collections real quick.

86
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:33.540

87
00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:36.600
Karen Fireman: You like Microsoft edge.

88
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.790

89
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:48.750
Faculty Office Hours: So I just get the 64 bit three days many kinda click on it take all the defaults you got many kind of setup right.

90
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:55.800
Faculty Office Hours: And then so that's just you know I prefer it over anaconda on it kind of just a bunch of extra stuff.

91
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:03.600
Faculty Office Hours: i'll just skip through these slides because i'll walk through them actually in the end, and then DEMO form right.

92
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:11.520
Faculty Office Hours: You know some of the packages are walk through i'll walk you through how installing packages and DEMO form and then visual studio code.

93
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:22.320
Faculty Office Hours: You know I went and just you just go to visual studio code, you can go and download and then get the 64 bit, I get the system installer one.

94
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:35.610
Faculty Office Hours: Because that'll just allow it to work for anybody who uses the machine, but you know, for most people doesn't matter whether you do the user installer or the system installer and so, then you know which I think you got past this part right, if I remember right Karen.

95
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:37.500
Karen Fireman: I think I did yeah.

96
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.780
Faculty Office Hours: yeah yeah I think he got this park is, I think we were.

97
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.700

98
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.780
Faculty Office Hours: yeah yeah.

99
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:47.700

100
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:55.590
Faculty Office Hours: And so the next thing you know I did like notepad plus plus i'll send you guys these links I didn't get to send them.

101
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.650
Karen Fireman: Actually, can I ask you a dumb question about notepad plus plus.

102
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:06.600
Karen Fireman: I know that i've all these prior and other notepads that are open, like other other files in notepad.

103
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:11.760
Karen Fireman: I don't know what I only want four of them again as like 20 of them if I haven't closed them.

104
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:16.890
Karen Fireman: yeah way to only show a few I can never seem to figure out how that is.

105
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:31.140
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so you can like if you right click on the tab so you can close all but this all to the left or to the right all unchanged closest at one time or you can click the little X so.

106
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:32.580
Faculty Office Hours: So that's.

107
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:45.120
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so that it really then usually there's a little arrow right here, so I just I don't have a lot of fun to see if I can I can open up a bunch of files actually I can I can I can do all this right let's see if I just get a bunch of files so.

108
00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.970
Karen Fireman: You answered it you answered it okay cool cool.

109
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:48.930
Karen Fireman: That was the.

110
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:53.310
Faculty Office Hours: Right, so that was just minimize this.

111
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.610
Faculty Office Hours: So that's just notepad plus Plus, I think.

112
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.780
Faculty Office Hours: I think I closed out my slide accidentally.

113
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.530
Faculty Office Hours: One second.

114
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:06.810

Karen Fireman: yeah I heard it.

117
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.790
Faculty Office Hours: So you know we're getting our environment setup you know visual studio code.

118
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:27.150
Faculty Office Hours: And so let's just come over here now, so this is we'll come back to the slides on second right so again, all the software installed really the only thing we need installs right now.

Faculty Office Hours: My visual studio I installed my mini Condor earlier and I had started to set up in my environment, and I was waiting for visual studio to finish so.

127
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:12.870
Faculty Office Hours: let's just go to visual studio so if, like we've come right here and we're going to start, and you know you have visual studio code you start it, you know, then I like to write once it starts up I like to right click down here.

Faculty Office Hours: And pin it to my taskbar that way it's always there.

129
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:30.390
Faculty Office Hours: And so, in visual studio comes up it looks like this right well to use it for Python coding, we need to come right over here to this extension So you see a little like four blocks, with one of them kind of at the top right going over.

130
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.040

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.410
Karen Fireman: or I don't think my mini condos set up right, I think I started it, but I didn't get to finish it.

Faculty Office Hours: looks like a clip that.

222
00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:55.770
Karen Fireman: I chose mini condom because I thought well i'll leave.

223
00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.950
Karen Fireman: i'll leave anaconda for Dr Jones and i'll do mini condom for.

224
00:16:58.950 --> 00:16:59.190
yeah.

225
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.820
Faculty Office Hours: I guess I shouldn't make sure that you really didn't have to install both.

226
00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.670
Karen Fireman: Well anaconda already with his we did it last.

227
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.750
yeah.

228
00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:08.460

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:17.280
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I do, but many kind of just a small scaled down version of anaconda you.

231
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.710
Karen Fireman: Like to do a lot of environments i'll be glad they're small.

232
00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:29.520
Faculty Office Hours: No, no, no, no, no, no it's it's the environments to let me step back to the environments themselves will be the same size what it is, is anaconda has a.

233
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:47.460
Faculty Office Hours: lot more other software that comes with it right so many content is just Python the Python executable and the condo environment management so that little manager that allows you to install packages, you know allows you to set up the environments.

234
00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.860
Faculty Office Hours: that's just stuff like that yeah.

235
00:17:52.260 --> 00:18:02.820

272
00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.270

274
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:14.670

321
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:39.990
Faculty Office Hours: So here's another thing, so what you can do like a few like select not not lines so let's do one thing first so on the right here and that interactive window.

322
00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:41.250
Karen Fireman: This thing over here.

323
00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:46.830
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so like you can so in the top there's a little toolbar up there right, where it says random number one.

324
00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:51.240
Faculty Office Hours: yeah yeah so so at the X does if you click the X right there that's just.

325

Faculty Office Hours: amazing.

326
00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:53.760

328
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:55.770
Karen Fireman: Okay.

329
00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:56.910
Faculty Office Hours: So that's the three years.

330
00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:06.330
Faculty Office Hours: or so yeah clears it the little like recycle on those you like undo like it, so if you over their credit themselves and typing stuff you can do that, but.

331
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:15.000
Faculty Office Hours: I don't really do it that way, I usually write this stuff in the Python follow there and run it and just let it run and that interactive window right and so.

332
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:25.740
Faculty Office Hours: Also, the other ones are like if you have the one right to that that will stop this the the kernel and restart it so like if you had some.

333
00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:26.640
Faculty Office Hours: kind of weird error.

334
00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:28.770
Karen Fireman: or yep yep.

335
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.330
Faculty Office Hours: So you need to restart it that'll restart their direct Colonel that'll just stop it.

336
00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.090
Faculty Office Hours: Like so get some long running processing or stop.

337
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.430
Karen Fireman: Stop good it happens all the time, I agree.

338
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:43.590
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so those the one to the right of that one one more over that's that.

339
00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.320
Karen Fireman: You go to I like I remember you said, the spreadsheet yeah.

340
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:52.980
Faculty Office Hours: yeah yeah so that just shows your very you know not showed you that's showing you had this database that's the type and as a variable.

341
00:23:53.430 --> 00:24:10.800
Faculty Office Hours: So now, if you go over to your left side, where you have the non pie stuff and let's just select lines nine through 14 and if you right click on that right, and so actually go to run, we see something go to the top do me a favor let's just go to the run menu at the top.

342
00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:11.880
Karen Fireman: See if there's anything in there.

343
00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:13.950
Faculty Office Hours: yeah it's not.

344
00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:18.690
Karen Fireman: used to be able to use F nine and some of them to run a selection.

345
00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:19.980
Faculty Office Hours: yeah but that's different.

346
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:24.420
Faculty Office Hours: yeah if you see this race go back to the thing and just so if you just go back over here and right click.

347
00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.190
Faculty Office Hours: And just say run and current file interactive window.

348
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:36.960
Faculty Office Hours: up a little up right there nope nope you pass it up one to two more now my blog.

349
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:37.830
Karen Fireman: There you go sorry.

350
00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.000
Faculty Office Hours: yeah no worries.

351
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:48.480
Faculty Office Hours: So see right there on the right, it says, do you want to open a new interactive window, so you can say yes and i'll open up a new one for this fall, or you can say no.

352
00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.190
Faculty Office Hours: It should run it you say no, it should run it in the one you already have open.

353
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.680
Karen Fireman: yeah well I just use the one i've gone yeah.

354
00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:04.890
Faculty Office Hours: So that it just it's just prompting you because some people don't some people, they want to have both those open so that like like like compare like they might have two versions of the script.

355
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:14.430
Faculty Office Hours: And they want to run them, so this is the one thing I have to fix and show people in class is what should happen is there should be an option that when you highlight that.

356
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:20.070
Faculty Office Hours: It should give you an option to say run current selection and.

357
00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.410
Karen Fireman: I was this stuff coming up.

358
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:26.190
Faculty Office Hours: Is because it ran though so that that's i'm talking about right now.

359
00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.120
Faculty Office Hours: Even though.

360
00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.100
Karen Fireman: You didn't just run it again.

361
00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:35.100
Faculty Office Hours: yeah and that's what I that's what I was just talking about part of the problem that I have is Microsoft changed the defaults up.

362
00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:36.180
Karen Fireman: Really mommy.

363
00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:48.690
Faculty Office Hours: sometime in the last couple months because it used to be, when you first ran a Python pop first time in visual studio code and all that it would say hey would you like to run this an interactive window and when.

364
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.350
Karen Fireman: I remember you had a lot of trouble and felt mad at them for changing it.

365
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:52.920
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

366
00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:53.910
Faculty Office Hours: I go yeah like.

367
00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.790
Karen Fireman: yeah like I you checked and then it wasn't right, I know.

368
00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:02.640
Faculty Office Hours: I literally checked all this code or the holiday and it's changed some time over December how functionality so.

369
00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:06.330
Karen Fireman: Will you want a question, will you teach us how to do the debugging because I.

370
00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:16.680
Faculty Office Hours: Know that's not so this class isn't so much about, in fact, to be honest with you, I don't really debug Python The reason is is pythons and interpretive language is not so much a.

371
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:25.560
Faculty Office Hours: You don't have to compile and so really when you're debugging is more around languages react to compile at emc and then you run it and then you.

372
00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:27.600
Karen Fireman: know I learned on those.

373
00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:28.800
Faculty Office Hours: I learned all that we.

374
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:29.640
Faculty Office Hours: Have so.

375
00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:33.330
Karen Fireman: So with Heidi through and all that and separate points and.

376
00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:46.920
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so when Python Python being more interpret language you kind of run it and it breaks and fails at the lineup breaks out, and you go and look at it, you know so really there's not I don't do a lot of debugging and Python per se like true debugging were.

377
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:55.620
Faculty Office Hours: On setting breakpoints and having to do all that I have you know you can do it, I mean you can set breakpoints and do all that, but I just don't have.

378
00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:04.440
Faculty Office Hours: With being how Python works and being interactive it is usually just you like Thomas to print statements and and debug that way it's usually it's a lot easier.

379
00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:05.220
Karen Fireman: Okay.

380
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.390
Faculty Office Hours: let's put on debugging.

381
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:09.090
Karen Fireman: The button and your home yeah no worries.

382
00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:16.530
Faculty Office Hours: debugging is usually more helpful when you get into like languages that compile because they compile and you run them and you're like hey I want to know where.

383
00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:21.510
Karen Fireman: i'm where i'm with you i'm a data dump the you know the stack all these things.

384
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:22.380
yeah.

385
00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:23.820
Faculty Office Hours: So.

386
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:27.600
Faculty Office Hours: So you should be good to go now, you know how to.

387
00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:28.020
Karen Fireman: Okay.

388
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:39.030
Faculty Office Hours: So turn on your stuff The other thing I will I will fix what I will, the first thing i'm going to do in class next Tuesday is i'm going to show people how to fix it.

389
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:46.650
Faculty Office Hours: Like i'm going to find the fix I already found it i'm pretty certain because I looked at my old environment from last year, because I haven't updated my.

390
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:54.390
Faculty Office Hours: You know, because what I installed on Tuesday was a brand new install I wanted to show you guys and gals how to set up your whole thing from start to finish.

391
00:27:54.840 --> 00:28:00.600
Faculty Office Hours: So that's why I kind of ran into a couple things because it was like they changed it between the last time I did that, which was a month or so ago.

392
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.130
Karen Fireman: I stop you for a second Jamie.

393
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:02.520
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

394
00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:07.890
Karen Fireman: If I close this right now and then I started again, which I pinned it like you did.

395
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.520
Faculty Office Hours: And then three how much you guys have another one opened up.

396
00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:12.000
Karen Fireman: What.

397
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.610
Faculty Office Hours: You have you have a few other ones already opened.

398
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:18.300
Karen Fireman: OK, so now they're all closed OK, so now I go, I want to get the openness.

399
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:21.600
Karen Fireman: And I want to do a new a new file.

400
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.270
Karen Fireman: Now um I just do file open.

401
00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:27.150
Faculty Office Hours: And I boy you say file new.

402
00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.710
Faculty Office Hours: Are you gonna say find a new.

403
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:30.120
Karen Fireman: already had.

404
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.140
Faculty Office Hours: A new one.

405
00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:31.860
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

406
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:34.770
Karen Fireman: So if I picked whatever this one was the pandas one.

407
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:37.440
Faculty Office Hours: i'm good to go what happened.

408
00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:37.920
yeah.

409
00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.590
Faculty Office Hours: So what happened was.

410
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:48.750
Faculty Office Hours: Is your you're here what happened well so that what happened, so I guess it was about to say is usually will open up which had opened up last.

411
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:56.490
Faculty Office Hours: But the thing or whatever reason why you didn't see what you had opened up for us because you close that one, but you had a couple already opened down below.

412
00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:01.740
Faculty Office Hours: And so, when you right click and say close all whatever the last one that closed is what it opened back up with.

413
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:11.880
Faculty Office Hours: So, so one thing you want to check because, unfortunately, with your version of anaconda it's not showing you the name, what I would suggest, for you carried every time it's good on that bottom left and click that.

414
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.520
Faculty Office Hours: And just make sure that.

415
00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.790
Faculty Office Hours: The Bot, though it's the right one, the body, the body 689.

416
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:19.080
Faculty Office Hours: See it's blue.

417
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.090
Faculty Office Hours: So what I would do is.

418
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:29.400
Faculty Office Hours: I would just click that every time like just every time he's lunch real struggle, the first time, going on there click the left and click that because that That way, you know.

419
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:30.150
Karen Fireman: And I should always.

420
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.440
Karen Fireman: Have a question this didn't say condo before condo I thought was that.

421
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:48.300
Faculty Office Hours: No it's fine it that's that's Okay, I think that's just it's that's it's, for whatever reason, the anaconda three version that you have that you install this and it's not showing the name.

422
00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:53.910
Faculty Office Hours: is probably the version of condo anaconda three that they install for y'all.

423
00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:58.770
Karen Fireman: So justin where's the over here that it's going to show up and i'd be lost it.

424
00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:01.710
Faculty Office Hours: Oh, so you got to right so it's because that only shows.

425
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:05.130
Faculty Office Hours: up when you run it so right click run current falling interactive window.

426
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.200
Faculty Office Hours: So that shows up.

427
00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:10.500
Faculty Office Hours: After you run for that so when you close this all up.

428
00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:19.350
Faculty Office Hours: And you open it back up interactive windows not going to be there because it's going to have closed out the it's going to close out that Jupiter terminal right.

429
00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:21.330
Faculty Office Hours: So that it starts.

Jim Clark: Is that what you got you suddenly I.

602
00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:51.810

603
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:57.420
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I have a feeling that's the problem I can almost guarantee I think you're absolutely right.

604
00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:58.680
Faculty Office Hours: that's your issue.

605
00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:06.030
Faculty Office Hours: Because I don't think I don't think anaconda I tensorflow I don't know if it runs on 32 bit.

606
00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:14.130
Jim Clark: Without being in the back of every class, I will go ahead and just installed me on it and.

607
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:14.850
Jim Clark: yeah so you can.

608
00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:16.620
Jim Clark: follow that recipe.

609
00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.020
Jim Clark: So that I got it set for.

610
00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:26.460
Faculty Office Hours: yeah so what you can do is what you might want to do is D install the 32 bit first.

611
00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:28.230
Jim Clark: and

612
00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:45.720
Jim Clark: So a funny thing that I felt ready, and this is this, you know that I, I take the install the physical bit, and it would never fully uninstalling with all those really file out there, even when you went through the $500.

613
00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.470
Jim Clark: And so, then when you fire fighter over install you gave.

614
00:47:49.650 --> 00:48:00.450
Jim Clark: me two copies of 64 bit anaconda, and so I was running into problems with continuity locked out of the biggest thing I raised a lot of frozen screens and so.

645
00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:07.110
Karen Fireman: So if I just wanted to run a couple lines and I get that that's a little bit of what you were bothered by.

646
00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:20.490
Karen Fireman: And I heard to the bottom below where it did run say we ran the file using the run command and then I thought, somewhere, there ought to be place, I can click and execute a line, but I don't see.

647
00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:20.880
Faculty Office Hours: It you.

648
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.600
Karen Fireman: can do it.

649
00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:33.060
Faculty Office Hours: it's it's shift enter, but the problem is it's going to execute it in that console it's not going to exit and that interactive window and that's the that's the thing I want to fix.

650
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:35.910
Faculty Office Hours: Let me see if I can.

651
00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.790

652
00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:45.630
Faculty Office Hours: Do this Karen let's do this, let me get my PC over here up, let me do something really quick.

653
00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:47.280
Faculty Office Hours: Let me.

654
00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:57.390
Karen Fireman: there's gonna be something below where I did print out in the in the interactive there was a little place there, which is very tiny and I couldn't make it bigger.

655
00:50:57.690 --> 00:51:01.230
Faculty Office Hours: And I thought I got that was telling you like the store like pilots or.

658
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:20.760
Faculty Office Hours: Well what's not what I like about it is because it runs in that um.

659
00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:28.560
Faculty Office Hours: Because it runs in that window once once I get the run line by line interactive it'll it'll it'll.

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:30.720
Faculty Office Hours: It will.

661
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:40.770

662
00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:45.600
Faculty Office Hours: And then you run again i'd rather just so lines that you actually run and then what's cool is you can like.

663
00:51:45.960 --> 00:52:01.410
Faculty Office Hours: Like you can run a few things like okay that wasn't right, you can then hit that clear button or hit the refresh and restart your active window and then fix your code and run it again and it's really just kind of Nice in their posture that are active window you get the you get the.

664
00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:07.830
Faculty Office Hours: You get the the little the little spreadsheet thing, so you can see your variables.

665
00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:15.480

686
00:54:02.790 --> 00:54:03.180
doors.

687
00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:18.300
Monica A. Harwig: Okay, so that I was installing every you know you're going through your video again and installing everything and I had no problem, except for got a question okay so on the.

688
00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:30.030
Monica A. Harwig: On your install notes on the notebook or whatever, and everything in it didn't have an issue, but then I didn't I wasn't sure about the last two lines.

689
00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:34.830
Monica A. Harwig: So I didn't install them to conduct a end export.

690
00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:39.000
Monica A. Harwig: And then you have oh yeah yeah username and you know.

691
00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:40.710
Monica A. Harwig: yeah and I didn't.

692
00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:42.540
Monica A. Harwig: I guess yeah sorry.

693
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:51.660
Faculty Office Hours: yeah no no jack you're asking so those last two lines that's like once you send that text file once you set up an environment, all I did in the bottom of those last two lines.

694
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:59.940
Faculty Office Hours: The second to last one with the export line that's how I can take that whole environment you just set up an export it to what's called a gamble file.

695
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:11.760
Faculty Office Hours: And then, once it's export it to that mo file, I can take that other line to use that to set up a new environment like a new name but with all those exact same package versions and setups.

696
00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:18.750
Faculty Office Hours: And so the point of that is just to give you the code to show you hey so a lot of times what we what we do is is.

697
00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:24.750
Faculty Office Hours: Some senior person might set up the Python environment in kannada that we're all going to use for our project.

698
00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:32.700
Faculty Office Hours: So that we're all using the exact same versions of tension flows X whatever packages, we need right now we're all using the exact same versions, that same version of Python.

699
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:41.010
Faculty Office Hours: Once we have that setup we can run that second the last line that export line to export to gamble file and then we need to send that email for everybody, say hey.

700
00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:47.730
Faculty Office Hours: use that bottom command with this GMO file to set up your environment, so, if you look.

701
00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:58.530
Faculty Office Hours: If you run that second to last command, and so I just have like a bracket that says put your name there that's just saying hey replace that with like your name it whatever you want, you know that's just.

702
00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:05.580
Faculty Office Hours: Something I put there, but basically if you go look at your homework what you want to do is is set up an environment.

703
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:12.390
Faculty Office Hours: And then the last thing what what's that environment setup the few to set up a new environment, but a few packages in there there's a couple.

704
00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:20.700
Faculty Office Hours: And then take that second to last night and run it and what you're going to do is you'll see in the instructions on the homework you'll see what I said name the file this.

705
00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:31.080
Faculty Office Hours: So that part where it says, I think it's like minus F and it has like this, this fall you're going to name that file what I said in the homework and it's going to output it in whatever folder you're in.

706
00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:38.580
Faculty Office Hours: Whatever folder you're in and then that's what you're blessed one of the things you're going to turn is that yam will file does that make sense.

707
00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:41.040
Monica A. Harwig: And yeah kind of.

708
00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:44.280

00:57:55.290 --> 00:58:10.200
Monica A. Harwig: To forever so anyway so but I did finally got it installed and then i'm like Okay, then i'll be you know I did the first line second line and it separately and I had, I just want to So these are my you know that what was on my computer so and then.

727
00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:24.810
Monica A. Harwig: And I, and I looked at it on I think it's the package I looked at it and I had everything like charisse and all that or tensorflow was installed and curious since I get learned and all that and.

728
00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:33.960
Monica A. Harwig: That was good, but then, like, I want to show you what I did on the last two lines and that's where I was like whoa I didn't know, I was like well I took like I.

729
00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:44.970
Monica A. Harwig: installed all except the last two lines and I went on, and did something else in like an hour later i'm like all right, maybe I should install this last or you know use these last two lines and, as you can see that's what.

730
00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:50.490
Faculty Office Hours: yeah that's okay so what's happening there is so what that is is because.

731
00:58:52.110 --> 00:59:03.330
Faculty Office Hours: So what's happening there is you can't write to windows system 32 because that's a protected folder and while you are an administrator so.

732
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:10.080
Faculty Office Hours: Oh, you know what go look at your text file think your maybe.

733
00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:18.690
Faculty Office Hours: Oh no, you know what it is, you see, all you have those little little little greater than less, not you can't put those in there, so that that's a programming like.

734
00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:34.530
Faculty Office Hours: that's just a syntax thing like nerds like me us and programming when you see that less than greater than thing that's a nerd programmer like me saying you replace this with something so if you go and open up your your so so you would just remove that so like if just hit the up arrow.

735
00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:36.690
Faculty Office Hours: hit the up arrow.

736
00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:48.000

737
00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:54.480
Faculty Office Hours: So then, if you hit the Left arrow 1231 more go yeah.

738

741
01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:11.640
Faculty Office Hours: right there and then hit the backspace again now hit enter.

742
01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:20.190
Faculty Office Hours: So that's that's my bad because that's me being a nerd in that.

743
01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:20.700
Monica A. Harwig: Now.

744
01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:22.860
Faculty Office Hours: So now, if you hit Dr.

745
01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:26.190

747
01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:35.490
Faculty Office Hours: And so you're going to see that I will it put it in this window system 32 folder that's because.

748
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:43.530
Faculty Office Hours: But if you hit Dir so what what we probably should do is this, we should probably do is.

749
01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:45.630
Faculty Office Hours: Is.

750
01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:48.120
Faculty Office Hours: Just hit CD.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.330
Faculty Office Hours: Do CD we're going to get out of space.

752
01:00:52.770 --> 01:00:54.150
Faculty Office Hours: And then backslash.

753
01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.540
Faculty Office Hours: it's gonna be right above the return you never.

754
01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:00.930

755
01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:02.010
Faculty Office Hours: And then hit enter.

756
01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:05.760
Faculty Office Hours: enter yeah now you're in seeing i'll go CD to users.

757
01:01:07.170 --> 01:01:09.600
Faculty Office Hours: CD space space users.

758
01:01:10.650 --> 01:01:11.220

761
01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:25.350
Faculty Office Hours: And so, your Harwich slashing them, so if you do CD space H, and then hit the tab key.

762
01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:27.690
Faculty Office Hours: agent hit the tab key.

763
01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:31.470
Faculty Office Hours: it's going to auto complete because it's only ah there hit enter.

764
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:36.330
Faculty Office Hours: And then, if you do Dir.

765
01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:45.570
Faculty Office Hours: So this is then you can hit enter i'm sorry.

766
01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:53.040
Faculty Office Hours: I mean if you go to if you do CD space documents, so, if you like, CD space documents.

767
01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:56.100
Faculty Office Hours: hitter.

768
01:01:57.630 --> 01:02:02.130
Faculty Office Hours: And then now hit the up arrow key a few times that you get that condo command again.

769
01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.860
Monica A. Harwig: hit the okay.

770
01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:14.130
Faculty Office Hours: yeah keep hidden arrow key until you get your do a few times, can we get a few split this up areas and dos, this is the.

771
01:02:15.450 --> 01:02:19.920
Faculty Office Hours: This is the it just it's not go go hit down arrow one more time doing it down arrow.

772
01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:26.940
Faculty Office Hours: hit down arrow there you go right there that's the only one that doesn't have those less than or greater things in there right.

773
01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:28.200
So hit enter.

774
01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:40.200
Faculty Office Hours: And so now, if you go to windows explorer and go to see users hardware game documents actually we just go to documents that file should be sitting in documents right.

775
01:02:41.790 --> 01:02:51.840
Faculty Office Hours: And so, this is so, this is when you're doing your homework you, you can just take the condo commands I gave you create a new environment give it a new name install a couple of package.

776
01:02:52.230 --> 01:03:05.310
Faculty Office Hours: Then you'll run this Conde end export and you'll just make sure you give it the name that I specified in the homework and then and that's all you need to know, is it see that see users are we give documents wherever you wherever that prompt says you're at your have to.

777
01:03:05.310 --> 01:03:11.940
Faculty Office Hours: go there to get to that file right does that make sense, so if you go to windows explorer you can now see what that file is.

778
01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:16.350
Monica A. Harwig: So it should be under users hallway GAM documents under this yeah.

779
01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:22.740
Faculty Office Hours: And if you just go to documents, if you just click documents that's what see users documents is so if you click that.

780
01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:24.510
Monica A. Harwig: yeah.

781
01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:26.550
Faculty Office Hours: So when you scroll down.

782
01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:44.190
Faculty Office Hours: You should see it down there at the bottom zip all the folders first in the files will be at the bottom so see right there that bond 689 spring 21 he go up just a little about like 10 up one more one more up like right click the right click.

783
01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.940
Faculty Office Hours: And then say edit notepad plus plus.

784
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:55.290
Faculty Office Hours: There you go so that's so that's just a game with policies, so you the name of your.

785
01:03:55.680 --> 01:04:06.240
Faculty Office Hours: environment, it shows you all the dependencies so it's all the packages that are installed so that's what this does so that kinda em the export command says hey take this con environment I set up.

786
01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:17.880
Faculty Office Hours: This is an export it to this email file and which is just a text file and save all my settings all my packages and versions and everything.

787
01:04:18.690 --> 01:04:30.090
Faculty Office Hours: so that I can then go and if you go to that text file that command at the bottom what that is is that's the one where like if you had a file, you can run it give it this GMO file name and it will.

788
01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:40.170
Faculty Office Hours: It will create you a new environment, with all the same settings and so this is so, how you can clone environment, with all the settings so the way we use this for is.

789
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:47.070
Faculty Office Hours: For a couple things one I created my environment, I put them on packages and I go want to show this the rest of my team.

790
01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:51.900
Faculty Office Hours: So they're all code on the same version of Python with all the same version of back end so I export the mo file.

791
01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:57.540
Faculty Office Hours: I send them the ml file and then I can use that last command that's in that text file, I can run that.

792
01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:06.870
Faculty Office Hours: give it the name of this GMO file and it will create the environment with the same name all the packages, or if I use that minus an option, I can give them the environment, a new name.

793
01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:18.390
Faculty Office Hours: So we do it to spread that environment out across everybody working on the projects, we have the same versions, we also use it to clone environment locally to say hey I got a new project I need all the same packages.

794
01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:31.290
Faculty Office Hours: But I still because this new project, I still want to create I don't mind a new environment for that project that way if I ever comes along, I have an add a new package to that project I have its own environment right and so.

795
01:05:32.610 --> 01:05:38.550
Faculty Office Hours: And so, then the other thing we do we'll use the CMO files is something you know, so we write our code in our local machine.

796
01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:43.350
Faculty Office Hours: And then, when we when we go later on in class we start talking about actually want to deploy this up in the cloud or.

797
01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:51.810
Faculty Office Hours: deploy this into to another environment, we want to make sure we all the same information, we can use these enable files to set our Python up with all that thing makes sense.

798
01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:56.670
Monica A. Harwig: yeah yeah so those two commands or yeah I got it now.

799
01:05:56.790 --> 01:06:00.810
Faculty Office Hours: they're they're not they're not there to set up your environment there, there is a reference to show.

800
01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:13.740
Faculty Office Hours: You like hey I have an environment setup, how can I export the setup of that environment to a text file a gamble file, which we can do, and then how can then I will tell you i'ma fall, how can I go and create a new environment using that game will fall.

801
01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:24.390
Monica A. Harwig: Okay, great yeah those are the major questions I had and so that means it i've got the that one question on the homework I I can do so okay.

802
01:06:24.450 --> 01:06:24.660
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

803
01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.970

Faculty Office Hours: To hopefully.

805
01:06:27.810 --> 01:06:32.730
Monica A. Harwig: yeah I did a good job, I did all that i'm not everything except for that create account well I did the kind of environment, but.

806
01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:47.070
Monica A. Harwig: install the seaboard package and I did that and then your package from on it okay yeah so I did that, then the other question is, and this is was a comment that Karen out in the class, and it was on the video it was during the break, but she.

807
01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:52.410
Monica A. Harwig: I had the same thing happen on my Python below.

808
01:06:56.310 --> 01:07:07.140
Monica A. Harwig: where's my Python right there Python yeah okay so she I had Python three dot seven and yeah I had that but I didn't have the other.

809
01:07:10.410 --> 01:07:10.530
I.

810
01:07:11.550 --> 01:07:13.200

1031
01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:09.720
Clay Coleman: So the.

1032
01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:16.710
Clay Coleman: Real quick The other thing I found I posted the documentation there's a way to specifically.

1033
01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:22.020
Clay Coleman: manually specify the interpreter through the settings done json file.

1034
01:28:22.050 --> 01:28:24.420
Faculty Office Hours: yeah yeah exactly.

1035
01:28:24.570 --> 01:28:25.740
Faculty Office Hours: And so reason.

1036
01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:34.050
Clay Coleman: So the prop, the problem is, is when you create the actual environment it doesn't create it in the same folder that it looks for for environments.

1037
01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:37.980
Clay Coleman: yeah so you have to CD to the actual.

1038
01:28:39.450 --> 01:28:50.730
Clay Coleman: One of the what is it, it has to be user local been, it has to be user been s been like their specific past in it only looks for for environments.

1039
01:28:52.350 --> 01:28:55.290
Faculty Office Hours: yeah I think I think I know where it's at.

1040
01:28:55.890 --> 01:28:56.640
Clay Coleman: that's interesting.

1041
01:28:57.660 --> 01:28:58.110
Faculty Office Hours: yeah.

1042
01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:08.790
Faculty Office Hours: I can, I can get it fixed it's not too difficult to get it, and if I can't figure it out, I can I have about one of about 100 people I can email tomorrow.

1043
01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:15.870
Faculty Office Hours: lunchtime, if I haven't got it figured out by the end to say where the heck do I change this and they'll all go oh you go here here here and you're done.

1044
01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:19.710
Faculty Office Hours: So I will get it fixed.

1045
01:29:27.450 --> 01:29:28.290

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.380
Clay Coleman: I got nothing I was just listening.

1047
01:29:32.010 --> 01:29:32.340
yeah.

1048
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:42.870
Clay Coleman: There was one other thing I know you mentioned, you did you you've never your you haven't used pie charmer you have used pie chart but you didn't like out setup environments.

1049
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:49.320
Clay Coleman: What specifically does it do that's different in setting up environments i'm just curious.

1050
01:29:49.500 --> 01:30:00.090
Faculty Office Hours: it's not so much hot sets up the environments I just don't like how it interacts with anaconda to get the anaconda environments in there it's not difficult it's just.

1051
01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:05.340
Faculty Office Hours: i've had a lot of problems, you know with it.

1052
01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:10.770
Faculty Office Hours: In the past, and getting it to like say hey use this environment to run all my stuff.

1053
01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:15.720
Faculty Office Hours: I just had a lot better luck with visual studio code.

1054
01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:27.450
Clay Coleman: Fair enough, fair enough yeah no I use I use part time at work, and so I decided to start using it here I just curious if there's anything that I was getting in.

1055
01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:30.780
Clay Coleman: trouble with or up I trump's like said, most people.

1056
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:37.560
Faculty Office Hours: Most people that I know still use by term, all the more and more people are switching over to visual studio code.

1057
01:30:38.730 --> 01:30:39.150
Clay Coleman: yeah.

1058
01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:48.600
Clay Coleman: I use visual studio code for a while and then I don't know I think one of the problems was I kept running into that thing, where you can't.

1059
01:30:50.730 --> 01:31:00.240
Clay Coleman: Like where the environment doesn't show up all the time and I I didn't bother to like find out why, and then I just kind of moved on to something else.

1060
01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:01.680
So yeah.

1061
01:31:04.530 --> 01:31:06.960
